<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark33"></a>At Home and Abroad</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pre-Determined Profits Not Acceptable</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8"> COM MITTEE of the National Association of Manufacturers has wisely, we think, expressed disapproval of the plan of making an annual distribution to employes of a pre-determined share of the profits of the business. The bonus system, which creates in every employe the desire to make the business succeed so that he may have a share of what he honestly earns, is better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American Thread Company Profits</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE American Thread Company, Willimantic, Conn., is capitalized at $15,000,000 and in the last ten years has made profits totaling $13,000,000. These were not enough; and a year ago, after a year in which they made ten percent dividend and placed $1,400,000 in reserve, they decided to cut the wages of their employes. The result was a strike which has now lasted for more than a year, involving great suffering on the part of the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cost of Fine Furs to Humanity</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font8">INE furs are appreciated by everybody; but they are costly, not only to animal life and to the pocketbooks of the buyers, but to the workers in the fur industry as well. The air in fur shops is laden with harmful dust from animal skins which have been treated with powerful chemicals. Some of the poisons used are arsenic, ursol and lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Cost of Boys and Girls</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8">CCORDING to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company a good boy eighteen years of age has cost his parents $6,077, while a girl of the same age has cost $90 more, the only difference being in their clothes. The little beggars cost about $250 before the first stitch of clothing is put on them. Their food bill for eighteen years is reckoned at $2,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Aluminum Company of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE Aluminum Company of America is getting plenty of free advertising these days. The statement is made that the total investment was less than $3,000,000 but that after paying cash dividends of over $15,000,000 the present assets are over $110,000,000. The monopoly is largely owned by the family of the present Secretary of the Treasury. The claim is made that the increased cases of cancer of the stomach are due to the cookingof food in aluminum ware. Boil water in a porcelain kettle and in an aluminum kettle and pour separately into clear glass jars. The aluminum boiled water will be cloudy with an aluminum precipitate, while the water boiled in the porcelain kettle will be clear. It is claimed that minute quantities of aluminum particles taken into the system are poisonous and set up inflammations from which ulcers and cancers may develop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Less Than $1,200 Per Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rpiIE Bureau of Economic liesearch has calculated that fifty-four percent of all the wage earners in the United States earn incomes of less than $1,200 per annum. This being the case, it follows that they are financially unable to pay lawyers’ fees to protect them in their legal rights. Chief Justice Taft has expressed the opinion that to take care of cases of this kind there ought to be in every criminal court the office of public defender, paid for »ut of public funds.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">. Dye Workers in Paterson and Vicinity</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE Workers’ Health Bureau calls attention to the fact that in the dye section of the ■ textile industry about 11,000 workers are em-• ployed in Paterson and Lodi alone, exposed to ' great heat, excessive moisture and steam and powerfully poisonous chemicals and dyes that undermine the health. These workers make </span><span class="font4">679</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">from $22 to $27 per week, working sixty to seventy hours a week. Deaths from tuberculosis among textile workers are double the rate for the general population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Murder of James Knox</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TN FIFTY-ONE of its fifty-seven counties J- Alabama still employs the primitive and vicious practice of leasing out convicts to anybody who wants to use them. In other counties the state itself works the convicts in mines; and just now its citizens are much ashamed that in one of the state-managed mines a convict, James Knox, five feet five inches tall, weight over two hundred pounds, was killed by a state warden and a trusty in five days because he could not learn how to mine coal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Energy and Courage of the Blind</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ONE can but admire the energy and courage of the blind, which enables 450 blind persons in New York City to earn their own</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">livelihood. They are scattered in fifty occupations. Two hundred are in business for themselves. Eighteen are salesmen. Seven are engaged in the practice of law. Eighteen blind music teachers and twenty-five blind musicians are in the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Two Aged Jews in Baltimore</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rpiIE New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> tells us of the death in J- Baltimore of Passach Yeserevsky, 111 years old, a Hebr<sub>v</sub> w, native of Poland. His wife, 109 ears of age, attended the funeral services and declined the aid of an automobile to carry ner back to the Hebrew Home where the two have been residing the past four years. She preferred to walk, a dangerous thing these days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Postal Service Self-Sustaining</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE increases made a year ago in the postal rates have produced so much more revenue than was anticipated that the postal service is now practically self-sustaining, and this in spite oi the considerable increases in pay of employes made a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Robert Harvey Does Buffalo</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">obert Harvey’s fat her is a doctor at Batavia, New York, forty miles from Buffalo, and ' wants his son to grow up able to take care of himself away from home; so the father brought </span><span class="font8">him to Buffalo, saw him established at the Y. M. C. A., left him some money and a letter of introduction to whom it might concern and went back home. The l&gt;oy, only eleven year’s of age, spent three profitable days, seeing many of Buffalo’s most enjoyable attractions, and returned home alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Testing the Strength of Dishes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">N THE testing laboratories at Washington some fifteen thousand samples of dishes, glassware and window glass have been broken in order to ascertain their durability. The tests have proved that American-made dishes and glassware are the best, and have also proved that machine-made glasses are as durable as the hand-made ones which cost twice as muck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Betraying the Babies of the Poor</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font8">EW YORK CITY may well be aghast over the revelations that officials high up in the Health Department, have been parties to a million dollar conspiracy to adulterate the milk which is sold in bulk to hospitals and to the poor. The revelations show that a third of the city’s milk has been watered or otherwise adulterated and a million dollars in graft collected and divided among these meanest of all thieves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Small Earnings of i armers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TN THE eight years from 1917 to 1925 the number of farm bankruptcies in the United States increased more than sixfold. For the five years ending With 1924, the farmer’s return on his investment was three-tenths of one percent. The year 1924-1925 was better for the farmer than the four preceding years, but even then the return on the capital was only 3.6%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mentally Disabled Ex-Service Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">\</span><span class="font8"> LONDON newspaper contains an advertisement appealing for funds for the better care of the mentally disabled ex-service men, of whom is says, “There are 5,000 of them in asylums living under practically pauper conditions, those men who, eleven years ago, answered the call of their country, clear-brained, normal, full of the strength and spirit of youth.” Woodrow Wilson said it was a commercial war. In America it made 4,000 new millionaires. One would think the profiteers would be ashamed of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Great Lakes Down Three Feet</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T IS said that the level of the great lakes is down three feet, greatly interfering with navigation. The cause is admitted on all hands to be the vast amount of water which is flowing down the Chicago drainage canal into the Illinois River anil thence into the Mississippi. This flow is admittedly in violation of .American law and in violation of the treaty with Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hard on the Shoe Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8">LL THE shoe manufacturers are complaining that the increased use of automobiles is hard on the shoe business. People are not wearing nearly so many shoes as formerly because much of their getting about is done by automobile. Millions of men who formerly walked at least part way to their work now go all the way by automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ninety Percent of Automobiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T IS said that ninety percent of all automobiles in the world are in the United States, and judging from the crowded condition of our highways this may well be true. It is also said, and this is not so pleasant to hear, that upon this one luxury the people of the United States spend every year more than the total European indebtedness due to this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Influence of the Clergy in Mexico</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE Constituent Association of Mexico composed of signers of the constitution of 1917, says in a manifesto that “the course followed by the Mexican clergy throughout history has always been considered by our legislators as prejudicial to the stability of our institutions”, that it has by every possible means endeavored “to assume actual control of the political life of Mexico” and that it ‘Tias fought every government that has come into power”. With considerable plainness of speech the manifesto goes on to say, “The clergy must not teach in Mexico, because when it had the privilege it ignobly perverted the crystal current of child mentality into the polluted pools of intolerance and religious persecution.” Finally the manifesto sagely remarks: “The clergy say to the oil men: ‘You are uot alone in your attack on nationalism and sovereignty; we are rallying to your banner.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Uncle Sam’s World Court Finnegan</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">U</span><span class="font8">NCLE Sam did a beautiful job when lie joined the World Court with the distinct understanding that this was not to be understood as a joining of the League of Nations. But a very little while later the League of Nations called a meeting to convene September 1st., at which Uncle Sam outside the League was invited to confer with the gentlemen inside the League, whether or not the Uncle outside would be an agreeable partner with those inside. “In again, out again, gone again, Finnegan.” The reason we never see any more of the old shell game artists at the country fairs is that they have all become statesmen of the Finnegan type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Europe Has Learned Nothing</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE virtual collapse of the League of Nations, or at least the splitting of it into two rival camps, has so impressed the American ambassador to Great Britain and the American minister to Switzerland that they have said in effect that the nations of Europe learned nothing from the World War and that the only reason why the situation now is not so dangerous or more so than in 1913 is that the powers are so impoverished that it would be difficult for them to carry on a war. Quite likely, however, it will not be long before they try to do so, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Regard for Life in Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TN THE British Isles, with a population of 39,000,000,the average total nmnber of murders is 150 a year; while in the city of Chicago, with about 2,000,000 it is now running somewhere near 2 per day. According to these figures the regard for life in the British Isles is nearly a hundred times what it is in Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">European Churches Falling in Ruins</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19260616_files/g_E_19260616-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">N EPIDEMIC of ruin seems to follow European churches. First comes the falling of the steeple at Toulouse, resulting in the killing of three persons in their own homes, then a dispatch announces that the famous Burgos cathedral in Spain must be repaired at once, and now it is the famous Cologne cathedral, weakened by the vibrations and concussions of modern industry. Nothing can save these old structures from ruin and there is no reason why they should be saved. For the most part they represent comforts wrung from the people in the lower walks of life, with little or no corresponding benefits or advantages to mankind and little real praise to the Creator. They make a picturesque showing of the sky line and that is about all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">^.’icrZcan </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Invention Alarms Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font8">ONSIDERABLE alarm is felt in Britain over the new American invention which makes’ possible telephone communication between submarines at sea. Some British writers foresee the possibility tliat the lime may come when a Hock of submarines at thirty fathoms di ptb may be sent against any desired object with almost irresistible power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">British American Tobacco Profits</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">H E British-American Tobacco Company has been engaged for years in teaching the Chinese in the most remote provinces to smoke cigarettes. As a result its profits last year were over $25,000,000. The tobacco used is the cheapest American product. Some of the Chinese have doubtless been turned from opium to cigarette smoking, hut this is all the good that can be said of this piece of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Demonism in Tripoli</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">N A matter of fact way the dispatches from Tripoli report that when Mussolini was there one of the features of entertainment was the act of an old Arab in driving daggers into the abdomens of one dancer after another, while the dancers continued dancing with the weapons buried to the hilts in their bodies. All should • be able to see that this is supernatural and, to grasp the correct thought, that it is the ■work of demonism. The old Arab was a clairvoyant, a spirit medium, a spiritist, under the control of ami in accord with the unseen powers of the air, the demons or devils of Scriptural parlance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Feminine Joys in Tunis and Algiers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8">N ITEM in the Now York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> tells that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the Arab sheiks enjoy riding in the new motor buses which are now carrying tourists about in those lands, but they tell their wives that the buses are only for the men. The one feminine treat is to go to the cemetery on Friday afternoon and talk scandal about their neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">In the Grip of Money Lenders</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font8">OMMENTING on the poverty of the rural population of India, the Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rural indebtedness is, in fact, the key-note of the Indian rural problem. All over the country the moneylender holds the peasant in his grip, and the most pressing part of the Indian rural problem is the lightening of this crusliing load of debt. Intimately bound up with the problem of rural welfare in India are sanitation and public health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Killing Women and Children in India</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font8"> of November 17, 1925, published in full the report of General Sir Claud Jacob, commander-in-chief in India, of the work of the Koyal Air Force in Waziristan, India, wherein that body of Christian gentlemen spent forty-two days and nights killing men,, women and children throughout an area of fifty square miles by bombing the native villages from airplanes. The British sustained only one casualty, when one of their machines was shot down. The bombing was done because a tribe of natives wanted amnesty for past offences and wanted a share of the taxes. Sir Claud thinks the bombing was a great success but does not seem certain as to just what permanent effects will follow this characteristically British method of spreading Christianity throughout heathendom. During the World War the British people seemed to think it was heathenish in the Germans to kill women and children by bombing expeditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ice-Cream in China</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">God’s Hand in Earth's Weather </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By A rnold P/tui</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">N NUMBER 164 of your journal you have published an article by C. E. Stewart, entitled. “Meteorology and Weather Forecasting,” which impressed me greatly for its clearness, and for the fact that as early as 1890 the writer was in touch with a professor abroad whose private studies led him to the same conclusions. This professor (who, by the way, is the one who taught mathematics to the now great Prof. Einstein of Relativity fame, then a boy in his sixteenth year) was firmly convinced that our planetary system, by reason of its attractive forces as governed by the law of gravity, had a dominating influence upon the general character of our atmospheric conditions and, as a result of such, upon the weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">11 is views were so advanced that he met with serious opposition from his colleagues, and more so because he also was a linn believer in the Bible and an honest defender of it, just at the time when the theory of evolution began to spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1 remember well his saying, “How wonderfully correct is the French expression, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;La m&amp;lianique celeste’ ”,</span><span class="font8"> meaning, ‘'The mechanism of the sky.” What an accuracy of movement! The course of each planet is held within such limits as to prevent overpowering attractive forces and consequent fluctuations of the atmospheric pressures which •would render life on our planet impossible; and within these fine limitations there is such an intricate and manifold variety of lesser forces that the atmospheric results never repeat exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 191)0 1 made a number of investigations which fully confirmed the theory that the planetary system, in combination with the sun and the moon, is the dominating factor causing our atmospheric fluctuations. I made a series of diagrams stretching over many years, noting the positions of the planets from the astronomical records available, and calculating the attractive forces between each planet and the earth at various given dates, and then compared the results with the existing atmospheric facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I observed that the attractive forces of the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Saturn were combined into one resultant force, that is, when they -were all on the same side of the earth; and as far as my investigations carried it was impossible to discover any exact repetition of tliis combined force, as to amount and direction, on any different dates. I found that a rapid change of direction and amount of this resultant force is always accompanied by seasons of great atmospheric disturbances, such as electric storms in summer and blizzards in winter, earthquakes, mine explosions (many of which I firmly believe are caused by ignition of liberated gases, due to electric causes in the earth and directly traceable to planetary influences), excessive rains, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In going over my old records I have found that whenever the six planets above mentioned were positioned on one side of the earth, so that their attractive forces would combine to make a mighty resultant attractive force (which would naturally cause a very low barometric pressure by pulling up the elastic coating of air surrounding the surface of our planet like as the moon pulls up the ocean and causes high and low tide, and which would result in excessive precipitation), our youngest planet Neptune was always in opposition; that is, on the side of the earth opposite to the other planets, and was also sufficiently close to the earth that its attractive force upon the earth acted as a stabilizing influence, reducing the great attractive force produced by all the other planets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who knows but that at the time of the great deluge this attractive force of all the planets was so great that it caused the disastrous flood, due to extremely low barometric pressures prevailing, and that our youngest planet Neptune was then inserted into our planetary system by the all-wise Creator to act as a corrective factor, so ordered as to prevent forever such a reoccurrence; and which promise is distinctly recorded in Genesis 9:11?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May it not be possible, also, that at some time in the future (And may it not be soon?) the same all-wise Creator may cause a comet to be caught by our planetary system, whose attractive force may serve to bring about a radical change in earth’s climatic conditions and transform the surface of our planet into a paradise, wherein disease and death will be no more?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This thought may be scoffed at by many, but there is proof that only the most intricately calculated combinations of forces and influences can keep our climatic conditions within such limits as to render life on our planet possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We know that many miracles of nature have been arranged for man’s benefit. Why is it, for instance, that water has its greatest density at 4 degrees (Centigrade) above the freezing point instead of at the very freezing point? The answer is positive and clear: Just because it would render life on earth impossible. Why? Water would then freeze and sink, until all our rivers lakes and seas would be frozen completely through their entire depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the Creator has arranged that when water cools to 4° (C.) above the freezing point it has reached its greatest density; that is, it there attains its greatest weight. Then strange to say, as it is exposed to a still lower temperature it begins to expand again and becomes lighter and remains on top. Thus a layer of surface water cools off to the freezing point, and remains there, forming a crust of ice which protects the layers below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This peculiarity of water is exceptional. Everything else becomes heavier with freezing, instead of lighter. Why should nature have the kindness to permit such an exception to her rule of expansion and contraction? Is it not reasonable to accede to the fact that an all-wise Creator had His benevolent hand in this matter, and has permitted this exception to nature’s rule for man’s benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is an unlimited number of benevolent facts in nature like that of the freezing of water. One more may be cited here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We all know that in winter the barometric fluctuations are much greater than in summer, but that the electrical disturbances are more severe in summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us consider the well-known fact that in summer the earth is about three million miles farther away from the sun than it is in winter, but that the sun’s rays strike the surface of our northern hemisphere more perpendicularly in summer than in winter, thus giving greater heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the southern hemisphere there is ■winter when we have summer, and summer when we have winter. Therefore, the sun’s rays strike most perpendicularly in the southern hemisphere at the same time when the sun is also closest to the earth. It would seem reasonable to conclude that the barometric variations caused by the closeness of the sun to our earth, combined with the increased electrical disturbances due to intenser insolation (more perpendicular sunrays), would be disastrous to the southern hemisphere every summer. What then still renders life possible there, same as in our northern hemisphere, in spite of the adverse influences?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The answer is that the Creator arranged that there should be more ocean in the southern hemisphere than in the northern. The water constitutes a regulator, which absorbs heat and gives up heat, like the Great Lakes without which some of our Central States would be climatically out of luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a wonderful field for true science, to harmonize immutable facts with the all-wise purposes of the Creator! What progress scientists could make, if they all were willing to use faith in our Creator as a key to open the door for further scientific investigations, and which would bring them nearer to that knowledge which is not chained to tradition! Man-made religious creeds and man-made scientific conclusions (or ill:’ -ions) and hypotheses may vary, but truth alone is perfect, because it is in harmony with tlie all-wise Jehovah, the Creator of all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">NO TESTIMONIALS</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font8">OR the past three years The Golden Age, believing that its columns could be devoted to better uses, has published none of the many hundreds of testimonials that have been received. The recent article “An Editor’s Predicament”, calling attention to the overplus of religious articles received, and inquiring if that is to be taken as indication that a change is desired, brought a chorus of protests from the ends of the earth, and a deluge of testimonials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do not be alarmed. The Golden Age has not the slightest intention of changing its policy. It merely wanted to hint to its contributors that it is easier for a thousand contributors to fill one department than it is for a very few to fill the others. The hint brought in some fine manuscripts on a great variety of subjects. More are welcome, any time. If we cannot use them all we will keep them on file for the use of the sons of Kohath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Levites of the Selling Game </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bi/ Joe Saunders </span><span class="font5">(Written In the breezy style of the West.—Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font8">HEN Isaiah, foremost of the prophets of Israel, took occasion to discuss the status of those priests who made lies their refuge, who hid themselves under falsehoods, and who declared that they had made a covenant with death and an agreement with hell, he described with accuracy just what has been accomplished by certain of our nonproducing High 1 hitters, herein designated “The Levites of the Selling Game”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Timo was when exalted rulers and valiant warriors practically monopolized the limelight, appropriated all the honors and emoluments worth mentioning, and indefinitely retained a strangle-hold on these divinely (?) appointed prerogatives. But a new order lias been established, wherein all other interests are subordinated to the advancement of commercial supremacy, and these two age-long beneficiaries of the divine-right idea have seen their pristine glory outshone by the brilliancy of Mammon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But no such sudden and inglorious decline threatens the real star today—the live-wire, high-pressure producer, who can by sheer force 01 personality and the clever use of a few well guarded misstatements get the signature on the dotted line and walk proudly home with the bacon. This man is overwhelmingly accorded first place on the list of “Who’s Who”, and is extended the glad hand at every turn. Not even a movie star, with half a dozen divorces to his credit, can crowd the Go-Getter out of the calcium glare, nor dampen the ardor of his admirers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salesmanship at Reduced Rates</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">O QUESTION the integrity or impugn the motives of the salesman, or to engage in a malicious tirade against all those engaged in that vocation, would be as absurd and as unjust as to contend that there are no honest lawyers or consistent religionists. It might be remarked, however, that those salesmen who walk constantly in the narrow path of truth and probity are about as precious as the golden wedge of Ophir, while those who are unhampered by any scruples of conscience might well be compared to the sands of the seashore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now most people are quick to recognize superior ability, and are willing to kowtow accordingly, even to the extent of indulging in a little friendly hero worship. But to look forward indefinitely to a continuous round of obeisance and oblation, at the altar of Baal's modern counterparts, simply because a few self-chosen apostles of efficiency see fit to rattle the tomtoms, is not an alluring prospect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The number of these self-sacrificing mediators, like the number of repossessed automobiles, has almost reached the saturation point; and the job of being intercessor between the seller and the “sellee” is not the sinecure it once was. About all that these ••best minds” can hope to do now, since normalcy has gone where the woodbine twineth, is to dispose of a limited amount of &quot;whoop ’er up stuff’’ to the predatory interests at reduced rates, and collect the “pe-cuniain infmitam” from the common herd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whether long association with the trinitarian idea has fixed the bent of the priestly mind, or whether it has merely yielded to expediency, three distinct forms of activity have resulted, viz:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) The deification of the “bunk” artists;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(2) The exemplification of successful high pressure methods;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(3) The dissemination of such propaganda as would tend to encircle their activities with a halo of righteous approval and sanctity.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">FEW concrete examples will serve to make these distinctions clear. The prodigality with which some of our popular monthly periodicals continue to advertise the enviable personal traits, marvelous attainments and even the unearned increment of the annexing genii, is as amusing as it is instructive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Casually perusing a current issue of one of these magazines, we find prominently displayed, midway between the modest announcements of the military academics and the more pretentious haberdashery and tooth paste ads, from one to a hall dozen breezy, well written biographies, replete with personal reminiscences and facetious anecdotes, of the distinguished wizards who have “arrived”. Usually full page photos of the subjects are attached, indicating that they still weai store clothes and wash their teeth regularly. A stereotyped form of story is generally used for sake of uniformity and businesslike appearance, and reads about as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Mr. J. Solomon Blank started out in life considerably below par, handicapped by both physical defects and an unprepossessing environment. Being thrown on his own resources at a tender age he wandered aimlessly through the slough of despond until he got a hunch from a Correspondence School ad, explaining that a few weeks mail order training in the coveted art of selling would augment his pay cheque by leaps and bounds and insure him a scat with the scornful. He immediately sent in the coupon and forthwith discarded fifteen ball pool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“At the expiration of the prescribed course he boldly hitched his wagon to a star and proceeded to sell a right-of-way across the circumambient blue; and by constant application to the job, and strict adherence to the rules of the game, he soon climbed to the dizzy heights of fame and affluence. Today he maintains spacious offices, equipped with mahogany furniture and angel-faced typists, in all the important commercial centers; has severed diplomatic relations with all lus improvident kin; has had all his contributing causes removed by a flock of high-priced surgeons; has mastered the fundamentals of golf and mah-jongg, and has donated a three-acre park to his home town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Mr. Blank attributes his phenomenal success to having always rolled his own cigarettes and worn suspenders; the former kept him in constant touch with his overhead, while the latter gave him elastic control over his upkeep. All of which proves that nothing succeeds like success; and any ambitious young man, worth the amount of TNT required to translate him into the kingdom come, should go and do likewise.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">S TO the actual putting over of questionable deals of first magnitude, this matter like-vase has some amusing features. An instance that occurred a few years ago in a mid-western city of ten thousand inhabitants is typical. Probably few cities or towns could be found in the whole country which have not passed through similar experiences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A young timber buyer, with a full-grown desire to shine in the financial firmament, found himself handicapped by his inheritance of a dilapidated, old saw mill. The machinery was sadly in need of expensive repairs, and the mill yard was covered with wind-shaken logs, worthless except for fuel. The total value of this layout, including the real estate, which lay at the eastern edge of town, was approximately three thousand dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the matter of disposing of this outfit for forty thousand dollars, and landing a job as manager of the property at an attractive salary, would have presented insurmountable difficulties to the ordinary layman. But having access to the inner court, and enjoying the loyal cooperation of certain high pressure gentry, tills ambitious live wire was able to turn the trick in exactly nine weeks. When this young mill owner called on the all-knowing secretary of the local Chamber of Commerce, and made known his modest desires, that worthy dignitary at once began to clear the deck for action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The offices of the local Chamber of Commerce were quickly transformed into a veritable beehive of activity. All the local captains of industry, newspaper men and other pompous “gazebos” were immediately called into conference. Bulky letters and important telegrams were hurriedly dispatched, and telephones were put into constant use; all of which would indicate to the observer that matters of tremendous moment were under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Special editions of the two daily papers gave detailed accounts of what was in the wind: C-ville was to have a great manufacturing establishment, and the citizens were to be given the patriotic privilege of contributing to this worthy enterprise, as well as being alTorded a rare opportunity for a safe and profitable investment —a splendid chance to boost a “Home Institution” that would furnish work for the needy and cause the commercial interests of the city to flourish like the proverbial green bay-tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Only a meager One Hundred Thousand Dollars worth of Class A, non-taxable, cuhninative, preferred bonds were to be offered to the investing public, hence every one was urged to rush his subscription to headquarters in order to avoid disappointment. The importance of putting this deal across while the iron was hot was quickly discerned by those in charge; so a tall, corpulent, well-dressed wind-jammer was imported from a larger city to direct the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Arrangements were then made for a “'booster”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1&gt; si qv.'-t. to be given at the largest hotel; and inv'.’-Hons were sent out to all those who might ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'',!y he shaken down for a few shares of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">i' ' valuable&quot; stock. At the appointed hour the i&lt; stal board was well filled; the delectable viands were quickly consumed; the gold-banded stogies were passed around; and then, having appeased the physical cravings of those assembled, the flood of high pressure civic oratory was uncorked. Prominent business men outlined the objects of the promoters, and pointed out with much earnestness, what the addition of another virile industry would mean to the inhabitants of C-ville, small and great, and how its benefits would extend even to generations yet unborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Silver-tongued representatives of the legal fraternity stressed the matter of civic duty, lauded the men behind this beneficent enterprise as self-sacrificing martyrs to the cause of progress. and branded the dissenters as vile tra-ducers and selfish knockers. A preacher then invoked the aid of God in putting the project over, after which those present were given a special opportunity to come through with subscriptions for “Class A” stock. The well-healed nabobs, of course, cast in something of their abundance; then the small fry in their penury went the limit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Getting on the Honor Roll</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE following day a large bulletin board was erected at one corner of the Court House, where the progress of the campaign was to be registered. Here the names of the victuns were posted, with the amounts for which they were hooked. Next a half-dozen teams of live-wire solicitors were sent forth to out-talk and overawe the tight wads, and locate any potential easy marks that might have escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the course of nine weeks subscriptions totaling the desired amount were secured, followed by the usual grand finale—a rousing street parade, embellished with innumerable boaster placards and a liberal supply of red fire, led by the C-ville Military Band, playing “W here Do We Go from Here?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The hundred thousand dollars all in hand, the enterprising young mill owner now received forty thousand, another twenty thousand was expended to erect and equip a factory building to house the sawmill; but just what became of the remaining forty- thousand is still a mystery as far as the public is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After many months of watchful waiting on the part of the indulgent stockholders this Onc-Hundred-Thousand-Dollar-Beauty which was to be the pride of C-ville and furnish work for everybody, including father, developed an acute case of managerial inefficiency, and went the way of all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Salesmanship a Modern Invention</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;D UT last, and most ridiculous of all, are the efforts of many prominent pulpit stars, some not quite so prominent, and a few zealous vestrymen, who occasionally assume the prophetic role to tickle the itching ears of the principal of their flocks, by conjuring up sacred precedent and Divine sanction for the up-to-the-minute decalogue of these modern-descendants of Baal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With great swelling words, and an air of profundity, these sky pilots tell us how completely Moses “sold” the idea of national freedom to his fellow Israelites, by using a clever line of “sales talk,” and how the learned Stoics and Epicureans of Athens almost fell all over one another to accept the tenets of Christianity when St. Paul came and displayed some real “selling pep” in their midst. They even inform us that the lowly Carpenter of Nazareth was the greatest go-getter that ever lived, because He attracted so many followers. They would have us believe that were He here in the flesh today He would be either an oil magnate or a steel king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Unless we have been extremely careless in our somewhat frequent perusals of the Inspired Record, it plainly states that Moses was so unusually- slow of speech that his brother Aaron had to be selected as his spokesman; also that St. Paul gloried in the fact that he “came not with excellency of speech,” and that he counted all worldly achievements as loss and dross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus declared that He had been sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and spent His life amongst them. Yet only a handful of the Jews ever believed His teaching or followed His leadership. He was neither salesman nor evangelist, within the modern conception of those terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Moses and St. Paul as Salesmen(?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font8">ONSIDERING the Bible statements a little more in detail, it seems barely possible that the desire for freedom among the desceuda ’a of Jacob in Egypt was augmented considerably more by the inhuman treatment they received at the hand of the hard-fisted Pharaoh than by anything that Moses may have said; and the only “high pressure” method that made any impression on the haughty Egyptian king was the vigorous application of the ten plagues, not the eloquence of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, it seems scarcely reasonable that one endowed with any remarkable aptitude for commercial bargaining, would humbly tend the flocks of his father-in-law for forty years, just for his board and keep. Surely a real producer could have talked the wealthy Jethro out of at least a section of land and a few hundred head of cattle in much less time than that. Then the fact that Moses was not able to get himself into the promised land is ample evidence of his inefficiency as a bargain driver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">!Nor do the recorded experiences of the famous Apostle Paul support the claim that he was such a tower of efficiency when it came to convincing a skeptical and discriminating prospect. The meager results of his efforts at Jerusalem, Athens, Antioch and elsewhere, if measured by commercial standards, would scarcely have entitled him to an increase in salary; and the fact that he left King Agrippa when he was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">almost</span><span class="font8"> (but not fully) persuaded would have “queered” worthy Paul with any present-day sales manager we know of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font8"> fl'os </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Always Sincere</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">EITHER do any of the Gospel writers record a single instance where the Man</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">of Galilee resorted to chicane, flattery or coercion to secure a following. Nor did He invoke the espionage laws against His traducers. In the case of the easy-going Samaritan, who went to considerable trouble and expense to aid the wounded traveler on the Jericho road, Jesus seemed to prefer the Samaritan’s unbusinesslike methods to the commercial efficiency exhibited by the priest and the Levite, who would not waste valuable time when they saw that the poor traveler had already been robbed of his coin. Furthermore, Jesus said that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">meek</span><span class="font8"> would “inherit” the earth. We simply can’t Imagine a real go-getter making such a prediction concerning meek ones, unless the idea is that if they ever get anything they will have to inherit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But as absurd and ridiculous as these supposedly profound ecclesiastical platitudes appear when contrasted with the facts, we would not for a minute want to discourage these breth ren of Churchianity in their commendable efforts to fathom the mysteries of Holy Writ. On the other hand we would encourage them to try again, feeling confident that a more careful and exhaustive search will reveal at least a few bright and shining examples of real business acumen among the ancients, any one of which might today guarantee its possessor an income in seven figures and a country home on Long Island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Or there was the ambitious and mercenary Gehazi, erstwhile servant of Elisha, who also had an eye for business. When his noble-hearted master had healed the haughty Syrian captain of his leprosy, and refused to accept the proffered fee, Gehazi saw a chance for some easy money and went right after it. Hastening down the road, Gehazi overtook the departing Naa-man, gave him a convincing spiel about the needs of two deserving young preachers, collected two changes of clothing and a couple of talents in cash, with as much ease and pompous serenity as if he had been trained in salesmanship by the best schools of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then these commercially inclined preachers might read of Balaam, who played both ends against the middle, until he could get a line on the winner;- or of the winsome and capricious daughter of Herodias, who so beautifully exemplified the “proper approach”; and then, by a skillful exhibition of the can-can, overcame the scruples of the crafty Herod and was proffered the desire of her heart, even to half of the kingdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, they might study the case of one Ananias and his thrifty wife Sapphira, who engineered a little deal in lots such as would make some of our modern realtors look like pikers; and also that of the affable Judas Iscariot, who sold the confidence of his Master for cash and made himself rich in less time than it takes one of our present-day dispensers of wild-cat securities to trim a confiding widow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">No Reason to Be Pessimistic</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">UT after all, we see no reason to be over-cynical or unduly pessimistic. There is an ever increasing number of hopelessly radical fellows, inclined to be red, yellow or almost any color but green: and whether they are actuated by unrestrained presumption, or by plain “intestinal stamina”, they persist in exercising their own grey matter to a degree that spells nemesis for the aggressive high priests of commercialized bunk. And we believe that it is not displaying an overdose of optimism to predict the early estebl I ncnt of a Utopian state, where plain old f' liioned honesty will head the list of cardinal virtues, and where the services of bunk priests will not bo required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thore, it is hoped, our present purveyors of best thorn bt will bo able to find useful employ-jnient—tillinsr the soil, digging irrigation ditches, building highways, or some similar form of honest labor that will have golf beat for healthful exercise by a city block. Then the residue of men will stand fast in their liberty, being allowed to figure out for themselves just how much they prefer to give to church and charity, what amount they will subscribe for the relief of the French orphans or destitute Armenians, and the extent of their liberality toward the Y. M. C. A. and the new Community Center. In fact they will feel free to pass up any of these worthy causes and spend a whole quarter at the movies, without being compelled to bear the contumely that attaches to the slacker and the tight wad today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And perhaps it is not too much to hope, when the economic order has been thus refashioned, that the Levites of the Selling Game, now so wise in their own conceits and so bent on their own exaltation, will, to paraphrase the words of a certain Hebrew seer named Zechariah (134,5), become ashamed of their utterances, and will say: I am no priest, I am a farmer, for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Stay Away From Picker </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By L. D. Barnes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font8">UILT in the heart of the tri-state mining district of Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas, stands Ficher, Okla., a “city of the first class”, but dilTerent from all other western towns; in fact, there is no other place like it in the w<sup>r</sup>orld. It is built up on leased mining land. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ore Line. News</span><span class="font8"> states that no Ficher lease runs for more than thirty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Indian interests, under the Department of the Interior, maintain an agency at Miami, Okla., to look after Indian affairs and to levy and collect monthly rentals. These rents are enormous, when it is considered that all rights and privileges of the renter or lessee are abrogated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mining interests take precedence over everything else in Picher. Drills may be seen running in the middle of the streets or on the side-walks. By streets and sidewalks are meant the gravel roads and foot ways. The inalienable right of the mine operators, Indian heirs and land owners, precludes the making of substantial streets and sidewalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Any one may own buildings, but you must sign away all privileges and rights on the land; hence the mine owners can move your house at will, if it stands in the way of the mining game. They can drill in your front yard and cover the premises with mud and slime a foot deep, and you have no power to stop them. They can set up in the middle of your corn field or garden, and tear your fence down, any time they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These inconveniences must be borne for the sake of “working for food to get more strength to do more work to get more food”. But the good people of Picher also manage to get some automobile rides, movies, and all the bootleg liquor they want, on the side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The little towns of Cardin, Century. Monarch, Treece, St. Louis, Hockerville and others, are built up in close proximity to Picher, while Joplin, Miami, Baxter Springs and Galena are its larger, cleaner and more healthful neighboring cities. But all are akin and bound by common interests; they all depend on the jack and lead business for their existence. With this the hopes of the people rise or fall. With every slump in business thousands of people leave within a fortnight. But just now the whole region is in “white”. That is, the mining district is shown as one of the white spots on the prosperity map. Upwards of a million dollars worth of ores are now being shipped each week. Much of this goes into the laborers’ pockets as wages, then the wages go quickly for rents, necessities, bootleg and trifles of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Present prosperity, so called, is manifestly largely artificial. It was reported in Roger Babson circles before the last election that there would be much prosperity provided the people did not elect Lafollette. All at once ore prices went double; but the suspicious part of it was. the demand became no greater. About 15,000 tons per week, according to metal news, is all the market could possibly absorb, either before or since election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Richer district is overcrowded, partly on account of the fame of Ficher and partly on account of bogus advertising, doubtless to purposely overrun population, bring about lower wages and thwart the organization of labor. Advertisements calling for “5000 Men Wanted at Richer” are often run in the large city papers when there is not enough work for the home guard. Thus the home-loving man is crowded out by the foreigner and transient. Just now there are three men for every job. STAY AWAY FROM RICHER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">People are living in tents, poorly improvised shacks, wagon and automobile tops. I saw one family last February with a Ford car for a house, and a bed made down on a piece of sheet iron, and only a rug wrapped around them for protection from the wintry blasts. Some want work and some won’t work. Criminals and holdup men find easy picking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the little houses are mounted on wheels so that when the wells of prosperity run dry in one place all can easily be moved to another. At some of the little camping places ears are conspicuous, which indicates travel when provocation comes to move. This manner of living suits the times and obviates rents and taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But this condition of things is not conducive to honesty. The writer was told by a deputy sheriff that an average of one automobile a day is being stolen in Richer. Even the family cow is not safe in her stall; I know this from experience, which confirms general reports. Liquor flows freely among miners. “You can get it on the streets,” say observers. Where liquor flows, crime grows. Prosperous and poor,' Christian and crook, continually touch elbows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How we long to see the kingdom of God in operation, to equalize, bless and bring joy, peace and safety to the groaning mass! It is surely the only cure for this evil-eyed and evilized (not civilized) condition of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Farm Hands and Farmers </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By F. M. Bradl</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font8">AVING worked for a market garden farmer for three seasons, and for a hay and grain fanner for one season, nnd then farming for myself for a period of thirty years as a market gardener, I will tell some of my experiences. When working for other people, at the end of the week or month I was sure of a certain wage agreed upon. Although many times the farmers had not sold anything, or taken in any money, he had to have money laid aside or have a bank account to pay his expenses until he sold some of his crops. Then if he had a good crop the prices were usually so low that it did not pay to harvest it. And when the prices were high the crops were always poor, and sometimes no good at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After paying for his seeds and fertilizers, his hired help, taxes and upkeep on his buildings, at the end of the year, the farmer often has nothing left; and if the hired man and his wife save part of his wages they many times fare better than docs the farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In my own case my wife and I saved enough money to start farming for ourselves. We had four children to support, and no one to help us get a start except that my wife’s father went security for the rent of the farm we leased. At the end of six years we bought a farm without any payment down. We had bought enough stock and tools to work a farm with, and also saved two hundred dollars during the six years’ farming. But we worked eighteen to twenty hours out of the twenty-four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">] Think of this, you city bred softies, who think $200 a month only moderate pny for your six to eight hours of eusy office work.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The gardening business requires a lot of help, so we had from two to six men working for us by the mouth, and we also hired some help by the day. We also had our berries picked at so much a quart, employing from 20 to 30 berry pickers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In reference to hired help, we found the conditions somewhat di lie rent from what the &quot;Farm Hand's Wife” suggests in the January Golden-Age ; for we always had to stay at home Sundays or at least be at home at chore time. The horses and cows had to be taken care of. Although the hired men always agreed to be at home on their turn Sundays to do the chores, they didn't always do so. If we had two men, every other Sunday each would have his turn: and if we had four or six men the turn of each one did not come very often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many times having come home late in the evening on Sunday 1 have had all the chores to do, and at the end of the season the hired men would get the dollars and I got the pennies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The industrial giants of our day have control of the prices on everything that the farmer buys or sells, as the Apostle James chapter five, describes: That hire which you fraudulently withheld from those laborers who harvested your fields, cries out, and the loud cries of the reapers have entered the ears of the Lord of Armies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great time of trouble, spoken of by the Prophet Daniel (12:1) will he the result of selfishness. But we are glad that Messiah's kingdom vwill soon be established in the earth, bringing blessings to all the obedient. “And it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear [obey) that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rewarding Versus Bribing Children </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By a Bachelor of Sixty-Six</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE It E is a difference between bribing a child, and rewarding a child. In Thb Golden Age, Number 159, in an article on “Handling the Kiddies’’, by J. A. Bohnet, he rewarded the unruly boys for their good behavior, but bribed the little girl to say, “Please, Mamma.” Bribery is always wrong, but rewards are often advisable ; and sometimes they gain results that could not be obtained in any other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning the question, “What does an old bachelor know about handling children?” He may know as much as anyone knows about it, if he takes his knowledge from the Book of Books, the Bible. There he will learn first to be just, and then to rule by love, seeking wisdom from God who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, if we ask in faith. He will remember that he himself is a child of God; he will watch how the Lord deals with him, and will take notice that God promises rewards to those in covenant relationship with Him, as His -wisdom sees best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tn His dealings with 11 is people, Israel, God promised them great earthly blessings for obedience to His commandments (mark you, He did not bribe them by giving them blessings </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to keep </span><span class="font8">His law), and promised them punishment for disobedience. Israel chose to disobey, and they as a nation have received very severe punishment. God always keeps His promises; and now Israel, having received and profited by the seven times punishment, God is fulfilling His promise to bring them again into their own land to bless them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us assume that an old bachelor is the guardian of a child. He should say to himself: &quot;Now I must obey my Heavenly Father's instructions if I am to expect this child to obey mine, for no one is fit to rule who has not learned to obey. I must show this child by my conduct what I wish it to be, ever acknowledging my imperfections and pointing the child to the perfect one, Jesus Christ. I will make no promises that I do not fulfill; I will endeavor to deal with this child as 1 understand Hi rough God’s Word is according to justice, wisdom and love. Tliero should be occasional rewards for encouragement, the rod for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">wilful</span><span class="font8"> disobedience, and forgiveness for repentance. I will never in anger administer punishment. I see that self-control on my part is necessarybefore I can properly correct or control another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a reward is given for right action there is a lesson that needs to be inculcated, viz., one should do right not inert ly for the hope of reward, but do right </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">because it is right.</span><span class="font8"> Learn to love righteousness supremely; then you will hate iniquity; you will see that right doing brings its own reward; it will have become impossible to sin wilfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sometimes I think I see a disposition among the children of the King to allow their minds to dwell chiefly upon their chance of getting into the kingdom, seeming to think they are sure of being of the Little Flock. 1 have heard more than one declare in public, “I am going to get there.” I do not think they will be found there unless they humble themselves. Evidently they are striving for the reward, instead of striving for the righteousness that is by faith, which brings its own reward, to wit, “In whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.” “He that humbleth himself shall bo exalted, and he that exalteth himself shall be abased.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally, the object in training children is to inculcate in all a love of righteousness because it </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">is right-</span><span class="font8"> This is the class that will get into the kingdom; and all such' will know how to handle children, even stubborn ones. That will be the future business for which they were prepared while on earth, by their experience with fallen human nature, in themselves and in others, that they might be merciful and faithful caretakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Houses and Automobiles </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. A. Bohnet</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font8">OING about the country constantly, one cannot but note the striking contrast between present-day conditions and those of forty or even twenty years ago. Whereas in times past people usually sought and built as large a home as they could well afford, and took pride in living in a large house amid spacious surroundings, one finds the people of today seeking and building small cottages of four or five cozy rooms all on the ground floor, even though the family be quite large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the front room one finds a davenport or a folding bed. Go around the corner of the cottage and you find a sleeping porch containing one or two beds. Go back of the imitation bungalow and there is the inevitable garage of comparatively large proportion, holding the necessary Ford or other up-to-date car. Sometimes the car is almost as big as the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Passing along the street in any direction you will note that nearly every house that displays a “For Sale” or “To Let” sign is a two-story dwelling or an otherwise big house. People of today want a small house and a big car rather than a big house and a small car. This may be because they expect to spend more of their time in the car than in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, we find many people constantly moving out of one house into another. Why is this! Do the frequent movers think it cheaper to move than pay rent! Or is it cheaper to move than clean house! At any rate it is very evident that present-day domestics want no large house to keep in order. The little house-on-wheels strikes the fancy of women in general when house cleaning is being considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even the merchants of today seem to prefer little stores and small stocks of goods, then charge for it whatever people can afford to pay. It saves rent, taxes, capital and clerk hire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Eating Less and Living Better </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. HicHing (Jamaica, B. W.</span><span class="font8"> I.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">N ONE of your editorials entitled “Impressions of Britain” you stated that both the American and the Briton would get on much better on two meals a day than on the customary three or four respectively—to say nothing of seven (!) as you saw it on one of the great ocean-liners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The suggestion at once appeared very reasonable and convincing to me, as both hygienic and economical, not merely in cash but in time and labor saving. In my own case it seemed a timely bit of information, as I have for many years been a great sufferer from gastric troubles which made eating and drinking more a terror than a pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Believing, like others, in the established idea that three meals a day were indispensible to normal existence, I very often had tortured myself by sending an unbidden meal into the stomach upon a partially digested one, or perhaps two, with the result of constant pain, both in my head and chest, to be relieved only by the volcanic eruptions of a kicking stomach!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Almost simultaneously with your article I happened upon a quotation from Herbert Spencer. appearing on the title page of a lK»ok that was always within my reach, but never read, which struck me as being in line with your suggestion; wherefore 1 decided to read the book, and happily found it to be but a faithfid exposition of the evils of three meals a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is undoubtedly the work of a conscientious physician who sacrificed the fortune that his American practice might have brought him, in order to give the world the benefit of his knowledge of the facts and dangers of overeating, and the possibilities of •'health without drugs”. (The book is entitled: “A New Era for Women,” etc., by Edward Hooker Dewey, N. D., London, 1896.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now for the quotation: “If there were no eating without hunger and drinking without thirst, then would the system be hut seldom out of working order.” I needed no further argument than Dr. Dewey's, based on the foregoing quotation of Spencer, to convince me that two meals a day are sufficient for the body’s need; hence, 1 at once decided to “cut out” the third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The only trouble left was for me to break the lifelong habit of the morning meal. You may imagine the “monkey shine” that a fifty-year-old bad habit kicked up when I started on an eightmile tramp tlie next morning without the usual breakfast (!)—not to mention the fears of sympathetic friends that I would collapse on the road!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But to my own surprise, and theirs. I got back safely; ami soon I found out that I could get on easily without a meal until the noon hour, or later; since which time I have been able to work ami think better during the forenoon, without the morning breakfast, for which I have no more use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am not claiming that my digestive troubles are all gone; but I am now much improved after two years’ trial and can say positively that it is a fact that two meals are sufficient for a day’s comfortable existence and efficiency. I am also convinced that “morning hunger” is but the result of habit—not natural—and can be easily overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As suggested in Ttte Golden Age, the first meal of tlie day should not be taken before the noon hour, and the second should be proportionately lighter than the first, and taken early enough to clean the “gangway” for the night’s repose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I might mention, too, that I have tried absolute fasting for three, four, and ten days duration with good results; even though the last one of ten days’ nearly ended my career, since I was already physically weak; having been so, in fact, from my youth. I make this statement for the encouragement of others to try an occasional short fast for the stomach’s sake, as suggested in The Golden Age, which I enjoy the privilege of regularly circulating (as a “newsboy”) in my own town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cascara Segrada</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE bark pulled from the Cascara Segrada bush is the world’s greatest laxative. Although it is found only in western Washington, western Oregon and in a limited region in northern California and in British Columbia, it has never brought a fair price to those who go into the jungles and hunt the bush and peel it, dry it. pulverize it and sack it, ready for shipment to the chemist, who works it up into liquid extracts, tinctures, tonics, tablets, pills and capsules.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When you buy cascara at a drug counter you are paying an enormous profit to the chemical company that prepared it. Of late, retail drug stores are buying it direct from the producers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Adeler Frith jof</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">leaving the chemist to furnish it only in tablet form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tea made out of the cascara bark is bottled and used as a family medicine. Cattlemen are beginning to boil it and put the tea made out of it into the water trough for their cattle to drink. For the relief of colic and constipation in a horse it is better than any other remedy known to men. Every horse and cattle owner should keep a 50-ponnd bag. It improves tlie health of both horses and cattle, and keeps their bowels in good working order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A mild tea made from the cascara bark is the most splendid laxative, as it causes no griping pain when made right</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Principle of Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rpilE use of foods in solvent combinations is not a fad, but on the contrary is based on established scientific principles. We may not know just why one food or one food demerit has a solvent influence in the assimilative processes upon another food or other food elements, but the fact is beyond dispute. The theory of solvents is the key to the entire dietetic question, and when the last word on diet is written it will be upon this line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We may use the utmost care in the selection and use of foods in a nutritive balance, but if we use them in utter disregard of their solvent affinities we still have a radically unbalanced diet. The perfect assimilation of food depends entirely upon conditions, of which one of the most important, is proper solvent combinations. Unless this principle is observed we are going to suffer from all the evil consequences of an unbalanced diet; for it amounts to one and the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Certain features of fodd solvent combinations arc instinctively recognized by all. For instance, neither proteins nor starches are readily assimilated without fats. A large percent of fat is not necessary for either, though proteins require the more. Everyone uses fats -with starches and proteins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a well-known fact that fats are almost impossible of assimilation when not combined with proteins. It perhaps is not so well known that starches cannot be perfectly assimilated unless combined with proteins. This is possibly in part due to the fact that the fats necessary for the assimilation of starches can exercise no influence whatever without a protein combination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Salt has a distinct solvent influence upon proteins, starches and fats, and very possibly upon other nutritive elements as well. The general excessive use of salt, with its resulting contrary physical influence, has led some authorities to dispute its necessity as a nutritive, but there seems to be little question that the human system does require some salt for a perfect maintenance of health. Only enough should be used to bring out the flavor of the food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is possibly news tn many that water is a valuable food solvent. Some people avoid water around meal time as though it were poison. The diet of the infant and of the young of all suckling animal life is in bulk principally water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Solvents </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By II. SiUaway</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The very sick and the weak convalescent can use nothing but a liquid diet. Can anyone give a reason why water at meal time can harm anyone? Did you ever hear of a case of indigestion as the result of a meal of soup alone, unless from an excess of fat used in it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no more efficient remedy known to work off a spell of indigestion than the free use of water. Roughage cannot be handled readily by the stomach at all without water, and water in either a cold or a hot form is essentially beneficial with all dry foods. It may be used either before ami after, or at intervals during the meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fruits occupy a very conspicuous place in food solvent influence. The sugars in the sweet fruits release the lime in all foods used with them. Lime is freely soluble only with sugar, and an abundance of lime in the system is essential to health. Its lack leads to various consumptive symptoms. Acid fruits not only have a decisive solvent influence upon proteins, fats, starches and sugars, but are necessary for the release of the inert potassium of other foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fluorine is soluble with fat, and is found in solvent combination in butter and dairy products^ Both iodine and phosphorus are soluble with protein, and iron is freely soluble only with sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the foregoing we have presented only the solvent relation of certain of the principal elements to each other as al present understood, a knowledge of which will enable anyone in some measure to regulate his diet for solvent benefit. But lot no one hastily assume that there is nothing more to it. The subject is a wide one, entering into every avenue of the dietetic question; arid an exhaustive survey of it is not here attempted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the puzzles of the past is why some people have been able to maintain vigor and health on a refined and radically unbalanced diet. The answer is that unconsciously or instinctively they have observed a good measure of the solvent principles of food combinations. The result has been that they got the full benefit of the nutritive value of the food eaten. Observation has made manifest the fact that the combinations in which foods are used has a stronger influence upon health than the real</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">nutritive value of the foods themselves, as determined by chemical analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this the use of a refined or otherwise unbalanced diet is in no sense of the word advised even in solvent combinations. But noting the effect of such a diet where solvent principles are adhered to suggests the great possibilities of a diet rich in every needed element w hen also used in like manner. But the tendency of dietetic reform is to get away from solvent combinations in an utter disregard of its principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are living in a day in which much importance is attached to food vitamins. That these mysterious vitamins are the result of a chemical process in food element combination is proven by their plentiful existence in yeast, which is made from elements not in themselves especially rich in them. It is now known that the identical health values of these vitamins is gained by the use of foods in certain combinations, even though chemical analysis may show a weak vitamin content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some authorities tell us we should eat only one food at a time at our meals. It is really a question from the standpoint of food solvents whether or not this is good advice in all foods. From both experience and observation we are inclined to the belief that the old custom of mixing foods is a good one if properly done. In some things there can be little doubt that such a mixing is beneficial to assimilation and health. Fruit eaten with other foods in this way is decidedly beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The action of the digestive fluids upon the acids and salts of fruit is immediate, and fruit eaten alone at the beginning of a meal seems to have little solvent effect upon the foods eaten at that meal. On the contrary fruit as a finish to a meal is of marked benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fruit should always be eaten with the other foods at the breakfast meal. In fact sweetened fruit should occupy the most important place in the breakfast menu. The system (‘specially needs the sugar and fruit acid combination in the morning, and the assimilation of other foods is rendered difficult and often causes trouble when omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A considerable variety of foods in their proper combinations, especially with the main meal of the day, increases the solvent benefits of all nutritive elements, and also has a marked influence in the neutralization of all potential poisons contained in the foods used. Improper food combinations on the contrary enhance the systemal effect of these poisons, and exert an influence against the solvent action of the combined food elements themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The perfection of food poison neutralization largely determines the nutritive benefit of any food eaten. Unless the inherent poisons in our foods are well neutralized a weak metabolism results, our powers of assimilation break down and our systems become clogged with excess waste. The only way this can be avoided is in the use of foods in changing variety served in solvent combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No diet is a balanced one that cannot be perfectly assimilated. This is first in importance in making up our diet. Elements in food which are not assimilated might as well be lucking iu the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Tribute to Lincoln </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H. Coyle</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font8">HY was Abraham Lincoln great! Because of his honesty, his perseverence and liis strong sense of justice. Of course he had other great qualities, such as sympathy, h</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">umili</span><span class="font8">ty and courage of conviction. ‘‘Honesty,” said the late Pastor Russell, “is the first requisite in any man.” How many great modern preachers and politicians are truly honest! Compare Lincoln with many gentlemen of the cloth and you will observe a great gulf between them. Notice in modern statesmen, captains of industry and pulpiteers the spirit of compromise, in contrast to the determined, rugged standard of “Honest Abe”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abraham Lincoln stood apart from the denominational Christianity of his day, and he w<sup>r</sup>as all the better for it.' His sense of justice could not swallow the blasphemous eternal torture creeds of the churches which, by the way, are not found in the Bible. Lincoln was a statesman of the highest order, and being a stalwart character he became a powerful reformer in statecraft after many disappointments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When but a young man Lincoln entered polities and ran for the legislature in Illinois, but was defeated. Next he entered ‘business, failed, and spent seventeen years paying up the debts of a worthless partner. lieentering polities he ran for Congress and was again defeated. He then tried to secure an appointment to the United Slates Land Office, but. failed to get it. Next he became a candidate for the United States Senate, but was very badly defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But long and lanky Abe, with a hopeful heart and many witty stories, was undaunted, and dared in 185G to become a candidate for the vice-presidency. But as usual he was snowed under by his opponent. In 1858 he was again defeated by Douglas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Notwithstanding, in the fact of all this Lincoln persisted, until eventually he became one of the greatest statesmen of America and of the world; and Gladstone may almost be pardoned for declaring that “next to Moses, Abraham Lincoln was the grandest and greatest man in all the annals of human history”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">THE “EARNEST BIBLE STUDENTS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AN UNHEARD OF PROVOCATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Earnest Bible Students” endeavor to establish themselves in our city. For this purpose they arrange meetings and distribute, and mail pamphlets and periodicals. Since the uninitiated believe that the name “Earnest Bible Students.” indicates a movement for the deepening of the Christian faith, it is necessary to show the public what these “Earnest Bible Students” really are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “International Bible Students Association” is a religious sect, and besides—what is not generally known —also a political organization, a new Internationale, with the political and economic objects of other Inter-nationalcn. The headquarters are at Brooklyn, in America. They have representatives in the European countries. The central arrangement in America is, on the one hand, a publication business and colporteur firm of world-wide extent, in the spirit and interest of its American promoters, and on the other hand it is a “world mission house” for the “conversion” of Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible Students’ doctrine is not a Christian doctrine but an ant i-Christian-JewLh one, on a pagan basis. It is the deadly enemy of Christendom and of the Christian people. Even the Catholic church is given such hidecent names that we can not repeat them here. Such a devilish hatred is preached against Christianity that one turns away with horror from this erroneous teaching. That boundless hatred shall here be proven by some excerpts from the writings of the “Earnest Bible Students”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Volume 7 of their “Studies in the Scriptures”, page 359, we read: “Christianity is to be made a deso</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lation from one end to the other by war. revolution, anarchy, hunger and pi tilence, that will provoke the derision and sarea t of the heathen and horrify and warn the pagan nat And in Volume 7. page 361, we read : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. t.a 1. hull be made more desolate than</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the wilderness suriou Palestine; it -hall be swept away from the face of tl « &gt;&nbsp;urth. Ou the gn at battle-day of Armageddon Ch; a ity and all Christian States of the earth and all its institutions shall be annihilated.” A great “world-catastrophe”, a “tremendous upheaval”, a “real storm-fiood of blood am! lire, starting in Russia” shall rush over the entire earth. [“&quot;Proclamation”, 1924, Ziirich, Usteristrasse 19. | Those are about the same objects that Russian Bolshevism is striving for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After this world destruction, already often prophesied without really taking place, the earth shall become a paradise. Tn the paradise of the millennium the “trees will bear eternal fruit”. A glorious time will commence. &quot;The funerals will cease, the undertakers will look for a more joyfid occupation and the dark hearses will be changed into excursion vehicles, painted in gay colors.” [“Harp of God,” page 358.] It should hardly be thought possible that such dense nonsense would find any believers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In strange contrast to the deadly hatred and the desire for destruction on the part of the “Earnest Bible Students” is the love of peace which they are preaching on other occasions; and here also the purpose obtains to minimize the Christian church. In the periodical </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Ace, No.</span><span class="font6"> 17, of September 1st, 1925 [German Edition], is an article with the heading “An Ecclesiastical Untruth, Repeated Again and Again”. Alongside of this article is a picture, showing stones in memory of our comrades who fell in combat in the world-war. On one of these memorial stones is a cross and the following text: “Be thou f&amp;ithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” In reference to . this honorable monument, created by the true love of their people, an assurance of the reverence of all decent people, the writer of the article makes the shameless defaming comment [gloss]: “The application of this Bible text to the man-killers in war is an improper use in the highest degree; tlie faithfulness which God demands is to love your enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here a so-called Bible Student commits the great meanness to defame a holy dedication in memory of German brethren who, fulfilling the Bible word, “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,” have fallen on the field of honor. The “Bible Student” is not ashamed to place the highest earthly virtue, faithfulness to the fatherland, always esteemed by all honorable peoples of the world’s history', into a forged [fabricated] antagonism to the precept of Christ who said Himself, in Matthew 10:34: “Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cynicism of an “Earnest Bible Student” dares to spit the words, “Love your enemies,” derisively into the face of a people who were suddenly attacked by malicious robber-statea and who were compelled to defend themselves. Peaceableness unto self-annihilation preaches the scribe of a sect that is obsessed by a beastly hatred such as we find only in the most degraded creatures of the history of the world, in the terrorists of the great French revolution, and in the assassins of the Russian Tieheka. Truly a more infamous abuse of the Bible cannot be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Swiss government has recognized the dangers of the “Earnest Bible Students”, and has therefore already prohibited the colporteur work of this American business firm in the cantons of St. Gallen and Ridwalden. In Hesse this sect, so dangerous to the commonwealth, is allowed to distribute their propaganda unhindered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the second paragraph the International Bible Students are accused of being in politics, and in the seventh paragraph they are blamed for not being in politics. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hessische Landcs-zeilung</span><span class="font8"> should use its brains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the third paragraph the Bible Students are accused of not being faithful to the Bible, and in the eighth paragraph they are accused of taking the Bible too seriously. Some clergyman probably wrote this article. It is not reasonable that an intelligent newspaper editor would make such mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the fourth paragraph tire Bible Students are accused of making interpretations of Scripture which are too horrible to believe, and in the fifth paragraph they are accused of seeing such happy things coming that it is a wonder that anybody would believe such dense nonsense. Then why do they worry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why should the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hessische Landeszeitung</span><span class="font8"> or anybody else feel sad because Bible Students believe, as alleged, that “funerals will cease, the undertakers will look for a more joyful occupation, and the dark hearses will be changed into excursion vehicles, painted in gay colors”? Will that take any money’ out of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Landeszeitung's</span><span class="font8"> pockets?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Landeszeitung</span><span class="font8"> ought to be able to see that the command, “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers,” has its limitations. When the higher powers of heaven give commands those commands are even more important than any that can be given by the higher powers of earth. The command, “Thou shalt not kill,” is sufficient to keep any true Christian from murder, no matter who tells him to commit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Christ said, “I camo not to send peace, but a sword,” he meant that when Uis truth would enter a home it would find some who would accept it in the spirit of it, while others would reject it, with consequent strife and domestic warfare, figuratively represented by the term “sword”. The context shows this clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That Christ did not believe in literal warfare is well known to every student of the Scriptures. “Love one another,” “Resist not evil with evil,” “Forgive seventy times seven,” “Overcome evil with good,” “Love your enemies,” etc., are but a few texts of the many that may be quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now if the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Landeszeitung</span><span class="font8"> hates the International Bible Students because they love the Bible and believe it, it is welcome to its position. There have been such haters of God’s true people in all ages. If the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Landeszeitung</span><span class="font8"> knew the great power that the Devil has been exercising in the world, and that it is this influence that has led to the superstitious reverence for kings and clergy and profiteers, it would feel differently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Comfort for the Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[IliMJioetiBt from Wut ch tower WBBIt on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">tt/^OMFORT ye, comfort ye my people, saith vJ your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the Lord’s hand </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">double for</span><span class="font8"> all her sins.”—Isaiah 40:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let those who read this prophecy rejoice! The time for its fulfilment is at hand! In a subsequent lecture will he considered “Israel’s Double”, mentioned by the prophet here. The purpose in the present lecture is to consider the physical facts which show the fulfilment of prophecy and which prove that the time for the comfort, of Israel has come. Let not only the Jews be comforted in their hearts now, but let the Gentiles also rejoice. If the facts show that the time has come for the regathering of Israel, the time for her comfort, then it means that the time has come for the salvation of the world. It is the beginning of a day of blessing for mankind and therefore a time for receiving comfort, leading to joy and songs of praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The law which God gave to Israel through Hoses contained a provision fixing die length o! time for the warfare of the Jews. This was stated in cryptic language; and now these words can be understood, because it is due time. After enumerating to them the many blessings which they would enjoy if they would obey His covenant, then the I.ord recites to them in the law the calamities that would befall them by reason of their disobedience. It is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not de all these commandments; and if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: I also will do this unto you; 1 will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you: and ye shall flee when none pur-sueth you.”—Leviticus 26:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Time and again the people of Israel turned a-way from God and were permitted to fall into the hands of the enemy. Then they would cry unto the Lord, and time and again God forgave them and permitted His favor to return unto them. The Psalmist describes their conduct thus: “They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils.” (Psalm 106:34-37) Here it is clearly stated that they were seduced by the Devil. Then the Psalmist continues: “Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, ami were brought low for their iniquity. Nevertheless, he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: and he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.”—Psalm 106:43-<sup>J</sup>n.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord was thus giving Israel opportunities to learn that obedience to Him and to the terms of their covenant would bring them blessings, and that disobedience would bring upon them sorrow and distress. And then the Lord said unto them: “And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.” (Leviticus 26:18) By these words recorded in the law we understand God's announced purpose to be that if Israel failed to learn her lessons and persisted in wrong-doing then He would bring upon her a punishment that would last seven times, in addition to the punishment she had already received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of her disobedience God pronounced through His prophet Ezekiel the decree which was finally enforced against Israel. (Ezekiel 21 : 24-27) The time of the enforcement of this decree necessarily marks the beginning of the period of “seven times”. This divine decree was enforced at the time Zedekiah, Israel’s last king, was taken prisoner and, together with other inhabitants of Israel, was carried away captive to Babylon. (2 Chronicles 36:11-21) After that Israel never had a king of David’s line. This overthrow of her kingdom occurred in the year 606 B. C. There was formed the first universal Gentile empire. There God overturned the right of Israel to rule, and permitted the Gentiles to take auUiority and exercise it. The conclusion must be drawn that the Gentiles were to thus continue by permission of Jehovah for a period of seven times. &quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">G01</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Israel’s “Seven Times”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE prophecy .f Daniel, with reference to Nebuchadnezzar and the world-powers, clearly means that the period of the Gentiles should be a period of seven times. (Daniel 4:16) This period of seven times also indicates the length of time of the warfare of the Jews, during which time they should be isolated and punished and persecuted in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A literal Jewish &quot;time” means a year—twelve months of thirty days each, or 360 days. If the time is symbolic, a day stands for a year. Seven symbolic “times” therefore would mean 2520 years. The divine rule for counting symbolic time on the basis of a day for a year is announced in Numbers 14: 33, 34 and in Ezekiel 4: 6. It follows then that the seven times of punishment that must come upon Israel, which would mark the period of her warfare, must be either seven literal times or seven symbolic times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These seven times could not be literal for the reason that Israel was in Babylon not seven 2 ears but seventy years, and that her punishment continued many centuries thereafter. It follows then that these seven times, without a question of a doubt, are symbolic. One symbolic time being 360 years, seven symbolic tim^s would aggregate 2520 years. This period of 2520 years began in the year 606 B. C. with the overthrow of Zedekiah, and necessarily ended with the year 1914 A. D. Reckoning by Jewish time, anti having in mind the atonement day, at the end of which the jubilee trumpet was sounded, this period of 2520 years must end about August 1st, 1914. If this calculation is correct, and it must be, then something should have occurred in 1914 to mark the end of God’s favor to the Gentiles and something to indicate shortly thereafter that God’s favor was returning to the Jew. We find it even so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the first day of August, 1914, the Gentile nations of earth became angry; and the great World War began, even as the Lord had foretold. Some leading Jews, particularly Dr. Chaim Weizmann, were pressing the Jewish interests in Palestine at that time. Turkey was in control of Palestine. Turkey must first be expelled before the Jews could accomplish much iu Palestine. In the latter part of 1917 the allied armies, under the leadership of General Allenby of the British army, drove back the Turk and forthwith entered and took possession of the holy city. Great Britain is, and fur a long time has been, the greatest world-power of the Gentile nations. A short time before this the British government, acting through Lord Balfour, signified its purpose of aiding the Jews in reestablishing themselves in Palestine. The Balfour Declaration, which has now become an historical document, was issued on the 2nd day of November, 1917, or about a month before the allied armies drove out the Turk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While this was not the first effort of the Jews to get possession of the land of Palestine and to rebuild it, this was the first official recognition by the Gentile powers of the right of the Jew to rebuild his homeland. And be it noted that this first recognition was given by the greatest world-power amongst the Gentiles. Exactly on time then, in 1914 and at the end of the seven times, the war began; and the good that resulted to the Jew from this war was the recognition of the world-powers of the right of the Jews to return to Palestine and rebuild their country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Within a short time the United States and a inunber of other Gentile governments concurred ii. the expression of the British Empire to have the Jews reestablished in Palestine. The British government was appointed as Mandatory over Palestine; and the League of Nations on the 24th day of July, 1922, confirmed this Mandate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A peculiar incident occurred during the consideration of this Mandate in July, 1922, which is of interest. It was realized that if opposition should arise in the council of the League of Nations against the confirmation of the Mandate, it would not then be confirmed. Lord Curzon was then acting for the British Empire. It was understood that Lord Curzon was not in favor of having the Mandate confirmed, and that he was unfavorable to the Jews rebuilding Palestine. Shortly before the time for the question of confirmation to be determined by the Council of the League of Nations Lord Curzon became seriously ill and could not attend. Lord Balfour was immediately selected and sent as the British delegate to the League of Nations and stood in the Council. Up to that time leading Jews were discouraged. But when Lord Balfour was appointed many enthusiastic Jews declared: “It is a miracle from God.” Lord Balfour, of course, was in favor of the confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the spring of 1918, about the time of the anniversary of the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt, Dr. Chaim Weizmann with assistants, clothed with full power and authority from the British Empire, went to Jerusalem and began the work of laying the foundation of the commonwealth of Palestine. These dates will appear again in consideration of the question of Israel’s “double”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Certain facts following are confirmed from a report published in 19*25 by the Palestine Foundation Fund:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On November 2nd, 1917, the British Government is'iieil the Balfonr Declaration with regard to the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On July 24th. 1922. at Geneva, the Mandate for Palestine was confirmed by the Council of the league of Nations, arid Great Briiain appointed as Mandatory of the League of Nations for the administration of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In June, 1920, the Palestine Immigration and Colonization fund, Keren Hayesod. was established by the Annual Zionist Conference held in London, to serve as a general Jewish financial instrument for the resettlement of Palestine. It was registered in March, 1921, as a Limited Company in London and began to carry on its activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking then of what has been accomplished since 1917 this report further states that the following things have beeu achieved, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Flourishing agricultural settlcmcntshavebecnfounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Modem suburbs and garden cities have been called into being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Extensive stretches of land have -been acquired as the property of the Jewish people as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jewish immigration has been regulated and encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Modern sanitation has been introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An extensive educational system has been developed. Hebrew has become the live national language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foundation fo» Jewish self-government has been laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If a minimum immigration of 30,000 souls and a corresponding budget for the Keren Hayesod of £1,000,000 is suggested, this means doubling the present rate </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> income. An immigration of 30.000 souls, for whom work has to be provided, implies that, in addition, thousands of inunigrants who proceed to Palestine with their own resources, and a corresponding number of doctors, teachers and officials, will find employment in the country. Such a development will mean a further growth of the Jewish population in geometric progression, so that, within ten years, from 500,000 to 1,000,000 T.ws could settle in Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people who, in self-sacrificing enthusiasm, are ready to devote their lives to the work of restoration, are ready in their thousands and tens of thousands. But the needful material resources are not yet available in j.Zequate measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On August 18th, 1925, the Fourteenth Zionist Congress assembled at Vienna, Austria, Dr. Chaim Weizmann presiding. The statement was made at that conference that the Jewish population of Palestine is now 135,000 and that immigration has increased from 600 to 3000 Jews per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Chaluzim—Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE men who are really doing the work of rebuilding Palestine are called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">chaluzim, </span><span class="font8">which means pioneers. Many of these are men of splerfdid education and training, but they are devoted to the arduous labor of rebuilding their homeland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Throughout Holland, Germany, Austria, Poland and Russia, in fact all over Europe, companies of Jewish young men and women are undergoing the necessary training to qualify themselves for work in Palestine. Since 1920 the Jewish immigrants to Palestine have generally been those who have gone through such a period of training. They are specially trained as locksmiths, mechanics, carpenters, furniture makers, electrical engineers, masons, watchmakers and other like trades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Zionist organization has provided immigration camps, where the immigrants are cleared from quarantine. When inunigrants arrive they are registered and a record is taken as to what they are capable of doing. An effort is made before they come to procure work for them, and they are assigned to places that they are qualified to fill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first regular census of Palestine was taken in October, 1922; and it was then estimated that 83,794 Jews resided there. Since then the population has increased until in the autumn of 1925 there were approximately 135,000. There is a steady stream of immigration of Jews to Palestine, numbering two or three thousand per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The building of roads is carried on in a systematic maimer. Prior to 1918 automobiles were scarcely known in Palestine because of lack of roads, but now one can travel from Dan to Beersheba in an auto. Telephone systems have been spread over the country and other modern means of. communication established. The Jews have gradually stimulated the building trade in the last few years. They have built flour mills,, oil, soap and margarine factories, shops for meehanieal engineering, carpet factories, textile mills, tanneries, hat factories and printing plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In September, 1921, there was a contract entered into on behalf of the government with Finns Rotenberg; and amongst other things it is provided in that contract that there should lie erected a dam in the Jordan river in Kerak; (hat a canal shall be dug for conducting water from the Lake of Tiberias, the Sea of Galilee, to a power house to be erected; that pipes and conduits are to be installed for conveying the water from such canal to turbine engines in said power house; that this watei^power shall be used for operating machinery to produce electricity sufflcient to meet the requirements of all companies, corporations or persons desiring to use the same; that there shall be installed necessary cables and transmission lines to transmit this electric current, also necessary transforming stations. The contract provides for damming the water in the Lake of Tiberias to a certain level. It also contains provisions to divert the waters of the Yarmuk river and its affluents, and the right and power to erect all necessary lines and distributing systems. Briefly stated, it has a provision for a gigantic irrigation scheme by which the arid lands of Palestine can be made productive. Furthermore, those portions of the land of Palestine which heretofore have been untillable because of swamps have now been drained and the water stored for irrigation purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Early in the spring of 1925 a steamship company, formed by Jews in the city of New York, began the operation of a steamship line from New York direct to Palestine. The initial trip was made by the steamship “President Arthur’ which left New York port March 12, 1925. It is estimated that fully 125,000 enthusiastic Jews gathered at the dock and cheered those who were going on this first voyage. Accommodations had been provided on this sltip for me; and having on two former occasions visited Palestine I looked forward with eagerness to going again and marking the improvements made in recent years. Conditions arose that made it impossible lor me to go on this voyage; and 1 asked Mr. A. H. Macmillan, of New York, to make the trip in my stead. This he did. I quote from report made by Mr. Macmillan as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About noon of March 31ft, the “President Arthur” came in sight of die harbor where we landed. The ship carried about 350 passengers, almost all of whom were Jews. They were gut tiered ou the deck when we came in sight of Mount Carmel; and when it dawned upon them that they were looking at the mountain where the Prophet Elijah at Jehovah’s direction had put to death the prophets of Baal, and that this was the land of their forefathers, they gave vent to their feelings. Old and young formed circles on deck and began to sing and dance and cry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">University Dedicated</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">TT WAS during the war that the cornerstone J- for Palestine’s Jewish University was laid. On Sunday, April 1st, 1925, the university was dedicated. Quoting further from Mr. Macmillan's report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At three o’clock in the afternoon the dedication service began on the eastern slope of Mount Scopus. Within the regular enclosure seats for about 8000 were provided, all of which were filled, and several thousand persons were standing at points of vantage on the hillside. The prominent figures on the platform were Lord Balfour, Sir Herbert Samuel, General Allenby, Dr. Weizmann, Dr. Magnus, Colonel Kish, Dr. Ruppin, Dr. Levy and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the platform where the speakers sat one could see the fords of the Jordan, where Joshua led the children of Israel into the land of promise. From the same point one could see the top of Mount Scopus, where the Roman conquerors had their headquarters while destroying Jerusalem at the last dispersion. One of the speakers referred to this, remarking that it was quite striking that at the beginning of the reorganization of the Jewish nation in Palestine they were linked between these two points, and there were dedicating a school of learning which in due time, as they hoped, would make its influence felt all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We visited a new colony at Dilb. This is a cooperative colony settled by Jews from Ukrainia. There is a dairy in this colony from which milk is sold in Jerusalem. Quite a number of trees have already been set out there. While I was in the colony men were busy at that time, and the ancient terraces are being restored. In addition to the pines and cypress trees already set out, over fifty varieties of table grapes have been planted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We passed by the colony of Hulda- This also is a cooperative colony, where several hundred acres of land had been planted with olive trees and also 70,000 trees of various other varieties. Mixed farming is done in this place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We visited Rishon le Zion. This colony was established some years ago by Baron Edmund de Rothehild, and is a most beautiful spot. They have a splendid macadamized road leading from the main road between Jaffa and Jerusalem, on either side of which are beautiful orchards, grape vineyards and orange groves, and in the colony itself the streets are lined with graceful palm trees. Here are located the Rishon le Zion wine collars, reckoned to be the second largest in the world. They produce 1,320,000 gallons of various kinds of wine each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From here we proceeded to Tel Aviv, one of the most advanced colonies established by the Jews; in fact, it is a modern city of about 25,000 population, joining closely to Jaffa. After passing through the narrow filthy streets of Jaffa and coming into the modem twentieth century city of Tel Aviv, one is impressed with the work that the Jews are doing in Palestine. Tel Aviv was founded in the year 1909, on the sand dunes just northeast of Jaffa. Starting with a group of sixty families, it has now grown into a flourishing city. Its principal thoroughfare, called Allenby Avenue, is the main business street of the city. It is sufficiently wide and comfortable for modern traffic, has paved sidewalks, is lined with buildings of reddish-grey stone and of stucco; and many new buildings are now being erected there, from brick made in the city itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the streets are lined with palm trees and look like some of our up to date California cities. In Tel Aviv is an Agricultural Experimental Station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is also located in Tel Aviv a Delfiner Silk Factory, the Rutenberg Power Station, and the Silica Brick Works, at which are made splendid building bricks. There is one large factory here, and several smaller ones; and from those sand dunes which were a great obstacle to the earlier settlers they arc now gathering the material for the construction of beautiful modem homes. Tel Aviv is a thriving city; and it has made such an impression upon the Arabs of Jaffa that the latter now desire to unite Jaffa with Tel Aviv in the hope that it may share in the general prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I visited the colonies of Petak Tikva, Balfouria, Nahala, and many other settlements. Nahala is built upon what was once a fever and malaria infested marsh. The land was soft and boggy. When the Jews attempted to reclaim it the Arabs jeered them, saying that even a hird that would stop there to get a drink would die. In 1921 the Jews began to drain the swamps. They dug fourteen miles of canals and laid much underground pipe. They assembled the water in a reservoir and erected a cement water tower from which the water is pumped and supplied for irrigation purposes to other districts that need it. At Nahala there are now 30,000 eucalyptus trees in one grove. The farmers are working with modem implements. Their homes are well-built, cozy, and surrounded with flower gardens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Colony of Ainharod, founded in 1921, is also built upon what was once a swamp, which has been drained and a water supply installed. Here numerous grape vines and olive trees, banana groves, cypress, pine, acacia, and casuarina trees have been planted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I visited many other colonies. Kenneret is located where the Jordan river leaves Galilee. There Las been much drainage work done here,' and over 60.000 trees have been planted in this colony. A modem bridge built across the Jordan connects Kenneret and Dagania. The latter-named colony produces much fruit, vegetables, poultry, and dairy products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy Fulfilled</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">HE Scriptures record that at the end of the seventy years’ captivity (536 B. C.) a remnant of the Jews returned from Babylon and with great enthusiasm began the rebuilding of their country. One is reminded that a similar movement is now under way at the end of the Gentile times—a remnant of the Jews are returning to Palestine and rebuilding their homeland. Have these things come about by chance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can any Jew who is familiar with the history of his people, and particularly with God’s dealing with that people, have any doubt what the present activities in Palestine mean? The return ot the Jews to that land, the building of houses and roads and waterways, planting vineyards and trees, and otherwise improving the land, are but in fulfilment of prophecy. The listener's attention is invited to some of these prophecies long ago uttered which the physical facts show are now in course of fulfilment. As touching the return of the Jews to Palestine after the last dispersion in 73 A. D., through the Prophet Jeremiah God said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: ami I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.”—Jeremiah 24: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Behold, I will gather them out of all countries whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: ami they shall be my people, and I will be their God; and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them.”—Jeremiah 32:37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The physical facts show that these prophecies are now in course of fulfilment, fully 1'35,000 Jews having been brought back from the various parts of the earth whither they had been driven. For many centuries after the dispersion of 73 'A. D., the land of promise lay desolate. God’s prophet Jeremiah foretold the coming again of the people and the purchasing of the land by the Jews:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. Alen shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the Lord.” —J eremiah 32: 43,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reference is made to the report of the Keren Ilayesod edition mentioned, in which it is stated that thousands of acres have been purchased, just as the prophet foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Above is mentioned the irrigation plans in process of fulfilment in the land of Palestine; the draining of swamps, building of power plants, etc. This is exactly in fulfilment of prophecy, as it is written:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittali tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together; that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.”—Isaiah 41:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oue reading the foregoing prophecies rejoices to know that many gardens are cultivated in the land of Palestine to produce food for the Jews who are returning there. And in this connection one reads the words of God foretelling these very things: “Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.”—Jeremiah 29: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The physical facts show that millions of trees have been recently planted in furtherance of the afforestation scheme of Palestine. God’s prophet foretold this: “I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree togther.”— Isaiah 41:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As above stated there are now eighty-nine Jewish colonies in Palestine. These are being built on modern plans; and houses are being provided for the people to live in permanently, not merely at the wliims of the landlords. They are planting their own vineyards and eating the fruit thereof. Tliis is but the beginning of the fulfilment of prophecy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble: for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their offspring with them.”—Isaiah 65:21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No nation on earth has ever had such kind and considerate treatment at the hands of Jehovah as the Jews. No peoples have ever had reason to have faith in God as have the Jews. The enemy, however, has long blinded the offspring of Jacob to the great truths contained in the Bible. Now the time has come for them to know these facts. Knowledge of God’s loving kindness in dealing with them is essential to their happiness. This is the time therefore when a message of comfort must come to the Jew. Every one who loves Jehovah should take pleasure in passing the good tidings on to those who are Jews and who desire to know and to do God’s holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">British Forces Out of Palestine</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font8">ONDITIONS in Palestine are so peaceable and so favorable every way that the British garrison has been withdrawn and the gendarmerie dispersed, as their services were not needed. The Royal Air Force has been found a sufficient protection against bands of marauders, such as in all ages have been in the custom of crossing the Jordan and attacking adjacent villages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">&quot;•We have now conic to the time in ■which these members of the body have their change instantaneously. One moment they are sown in corruption; the next, raised in incorruption. One moment in dishonor; the next in glory. One moment in weakness; the next in power. When the church is finished and all of the 144,000 members are with the Lord, “then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?” (1 Corinthians 15:54, 55) Then it will be that all composing that class will enjoy glory, honor, immortality, even eternal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>Bl</sup>“It is certain that the time must come when all.those composing the body of Christ will have finished their course on this side the vail and passed into heavenly glory; and since the Lord promised that His second presence would be for the purpose of gathering unto Himself those who would compose His bride, we should expect the glorification of the church to take place within a reasonably short time after the second presence of the Lord. The Apostle Paul’s mind was illuminated by the power of Jehovah, the holy Spirit; and he wrote concerning the coming kingdom of Messiah, describing conditions that would immediately precede its inauguration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>62</sup>“At Mount Sinai Jehovah made a covenant with the nation of Israel; and at the time of making this covenant God directed Moses to instruct the people, to prepare them for what was about to take place. When Moses came down out of the mountain to deliver God’s message to Israel, it was amidst a groat convulsion of nature. There were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud of smoke upon the mountain, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud, so that the people in the camp trembled with fear, and the whole earth.quaked greatly. This was a picture foreshadowing the time of trouble in the earth, the great shaking of the nations just before the inauguration of Messiah’s kingdom and the taking unto Himself of His bride for the setting up of His kingdom. St. Paul, referring to that time, by way of comparison says: “Ye are not come unto the mount that might lie touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words: which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more (for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart; and so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake).”—Hebrews 12:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’“We should expect, then, an antitypical fulfilment of these conditions. And so we do find it. The mountains (symbolically meaning kingdoms of the world) are on fire, and there is a great tempest, and trouble, and disturbance in the earth; and so terrible is the time that men’s hearts are failing them for fear of what they see coming on the earth. Speaking of that time, and directing his words to the church, St. Paul wrote: “Ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of AbeL”—Hebrews 12:22-24.</span></p>
