<p><span class="font0">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font3">come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>JEHOVAH’S EXECUTIONER.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“For </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son. And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.”—John 5:22,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH must and will execute all of his enemies in order that his holy name, fame and good reputation may abide for ever. In no other way could the universe be made clean and the name of Jehovah made to occupy the place where it belongs in the hearts and minds of his creatures. His judgments against his enemies are written. In the execution of these judgments Jehovah employs certain of his creatures that are loyal, true and faithful to him. An executioner is one who executes a legal judgment in conformity to his certificate of authority or commission. The one who renders the judgment takes the responsibility therefor. The executioner is merely the arm of the law or supreme authority. The judgment of Jehovah God against his enemies declares that they shall be destroyed. (Ps. 145:20) “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.’’ (Ps. 21:8,9,11,12) An executioner is a vindicator of God’s name. “If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render venge-rnce to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. ’ ’—Deut. 32: 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Who are God’s enemies? His arch or chief enemy </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">Satan the Devil, and with him there is a host of wicked ones. Satan’s covetous desire to make merchandise of the human race led him to formulate a scheme for the alienation of mankind from God. That scheme was based upon a false religion, to wit, the worship of the Devil primarily, and secondarily, the worship </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">anything to turn man away from Jehovah. The express purpose of Jehovah is to destroy Satan’s false religious schemes and what has grown out of them, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">this purpose he definitely makes known when he says: “Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment.” (Ex. 12:12) Whom will Jehovah use to</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">execute his judgments? With the people of Israel God began to make pictures of the execution of his judgments and to foreshadow his Executioner. “David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.” (2 Sam. 8:15) David was a type of Christ Jesus. Solomon was commanded to execute the judgments of Jehovah. (1 Ki. 6:12) He was also a type of Christ as long as he was faithful to Jehovah. “0 house of David, thus saith the Lord, Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor.” (Jer. 21:12) “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby ho shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.” (Jer. 23: 5, 6) These scriptures foreshadow Christ Jesus. “And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. ’ ’ (Mic. 5:15) This prophecy foretells the work of Christ Jesus. Jesus himself stated that to him is committed all judgment and the execution thereof. (John 5:22,27) These scriptures definitely provo that Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Executioner and support the conclusion that those appointed by Jehovah in Israel to execute his judgments typify or foreshadow Christ Jesus. By the will of Jehovah God Christ Jesus associates others with him in the execution of Jehovah’s judgments. Together these constitute the “higher powers” that are ordained of God. ‘ ‘ For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” (Rom. 13:1-4) This is further supported by the statement : ‘ ‘ Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all; and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” (Jude 14, 15) This scripture refers to the execution of final judgment. As to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">those who are associated with Christ Jesus in this work: “To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.” —Ps. 149:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHU</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">•Having in mind the foregoing points, which are definitely settled by the Scriptures, consideration is now given as to whom Jehu foreshadowed or pictured. As the Scriptures show that we are near the great conflict in which Jehovah will express his wrath upon his enemies, we may look with confidence to him to give us an understanding of the matter concerning Jehu and his slaughter work, of which the Scriptures specifically speak. That Jehu was an executioner of judgments of Jehovah there cannot be the slightest doubt, because it is written, in 2 Chronicles 22: 7, 8: “And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram; for when he was come, he went out with Jeho-ram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.” Whom did Jehu foreshadow ? What is meant by the Jehu work </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> In the outset, and in order to consider the Scriptural proof to a better advantage, the answer to the foregoing question as to whom Jehu foreshadowed is specifically given, and then followed by argument based upon the Scriptures in support of the answer. This will enable the student in progressing with the study to determine whether or not the answer is correct. The answer is, to wit: From the time Jehu was anointed and until he had completed the execution of his divinely given commission he pictured or foreshadowed the work of the execution to be done in “the day of the Lord” by Christ Jesus, the Chief Executive of Jehovah, and in which work his body members in glory, the remnant who are members of his body and are now on the earth, and his host of holy angels, all participate. The Jehu work runs parallel with the work foreshadowed by the prophecy of Ezekiel appearing in chapters nine and ten concerning ‘the man clothed in linen and with the writer’sinkhorn by his side’, and with the work of marking the foreheads of the people and scattering coals of fire over the city, and with the six men that followed him with slaughter weapons, and the destroying the city. The Lord having revealed to his people the meaning of the ninth and tenth chapters of Ezekiel’s prophecy, as well as other parts thereof, and since the Jehu work is directly related thereto, it seems God’s due time to permit his people to understand the Jehu picture and the work that Jehu performed. The work of Jehu was for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and therefore is properly considered in connection with the study of Ezekiel’s prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• Elijah foreshadowed the ambassadorial or witness work to be done by God’s people during the time of ‘preparing the way before the Lord’. His was a restitution work also, as Jesus declared, and thus showing that in the Elijah period of the church a similar work was done. (Matt. 17:11) His was also a work looking to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Elisha was anointed to finish the work Elijah had begun, and hence his was an ambassadorial or witness work also. But furthermore of him it is written: “And him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.” This shows that the Elisha work is directly related to the execution of the enemies of Jehovah. (1 Ki. 19: 17) Jehu pictures an execution or destructive work for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Elisha also foreshadows a vindication work, showing that the same persons connected with the Elisha work are likewise connected with the Jehu work. Elisha was anointed long before Jehu received his anointing; which shows that the witness work must be done first and must then be followed by the work of destruction, even as shown by the ninth chapter of Ezekiel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HISTORICAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Some historical facts concerning Israel’s rulers, and in which Jehu figures, will be of interest at this point. The ten tribes of Israel had rebelled against the house of David and had selected their own king. Asa was king of Judah and reigned at Jerusalem about 979 B.C. The ten tribes were located in the north part of Palestine. Omri, a captain in the army of Israel, seized the throne of Israel, making himself king. Later he bought the site of Samaria and built his royal house there, where he reigned over the ten tribes of Israel. (1 Ki. 16:16-24) Ahab succeeded Omri as king of Israel. Ahab married Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal. To Ahab and Jezebel was born a daughter named Athaliah. Some time later Elijah prophesied concerning the coming of the three and one-half years of famine. Afterwards Ahab was killed in battle, and was succeeded by his son Ahaziah. (1 Ki. 22:34-40) Elijah anointed Elisha in his place or stead. Athaliah the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel married Jehoram, the heir to the throne over Judah. He began to reign about 913 B.C., at Jerusalem. (2 Chron. 21:1) He was succeeded to the throne by Ahaziah the son of Athaliah, who was a grandson of Jezebel. Joram (Jehoram) the son of Ahab succeeded Ahaziah his brother to the throne of Israel. Elijah was taken away, and was succeeded by the prophet Elisha. Then Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, was anointed to be king over Israel. (2 Ki. 9:1-6) Shortly thereafter Jehu slew Joram (or Jehoram). (2 Ki. 9:24) Thereafter Jehu wiped out the entire house of Ahab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE KEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">•Jehovah’s purpose in having the house of Ahab destroyed furnishes the main key to the understanding of the work that Jehu performed and what it foreshadowed. Ahab pictured Satan, that old Serpent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Devil. </span><span class="font4">Jezebel, his wife, pictured Satan’s woman or organization. Their offspring or seed pictures ‘the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">seed of the </span><span class="font4">Serpent’, which must </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">destroyed because anti-God, anti-Christ and anti-kingdom. The work of Jehu pictures Jehovah’s procedure in destroying that which has brought depravity upon the human race and dishonor upon Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• The chief development leading up to the slaughter work done by Jehu was Baal worship, which is Devil worship. The name Baal means “to be master; hence, to marry, to be the husband and, figuratively, the owner”. Baal worship therefore appears to be the worship of the Devil by joining the organization of which the Devil is the master, husband and owner, and by accepting him, the Devil, as lord and head. “Baal-peor” means the practice of this Devil religion in connection with lewd and immoral women. It was a seductive means of turning men away from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Balaam, the soothsayer from Mesopotamia, taught Balak the king of Moab how to seduce the Israelites in connection with this devilish religion of Baal-peor. That Jehovah hated the detestable thing is shown by the following: “And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor; and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord, against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.” (Num. 25: 1-5) That wicked Balaam was slain by the sword at the command of the Lord given to Moses.—Num. 31:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Gideon was faithful to the Lord and was also used to execute God’s judgment against Baal worship. (Judg. 6:24-32) After Gideon’s death the Israelites again fell away to Baal worship. (Judg. 8:33) God caused his faithful prophet Samuel to warn the Israelites concerning Baal worship. “And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, -and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the Lord only,” 1 Sam. 7:3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> David was faithful to Jehovah and he “sought not unto Baalim; but sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel”. (2 Chron. 17:3,4) Jehovah was long-suffering with the Israelites, and when they repented he forgave them and further extended his favors to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> After the ten tribes withdrew from Judah and set up their own kingdom at Samaria, it was Omri who gave official sanction to satanic worship by the Israelites. Ahab followed him on the throne, and concerning him it is written: “And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.”—1 Ki. 16:30-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The three and one-half years’ famine came upon Israel even as Elijah had prophesied. About the time of the end of that famine Elijah met Ahab and then and there told Ahab to his face that his practice of the Devil religion was the real cause of the trouble upon Israel. “And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel ? And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou hast followed Baalim.”—1 Ki. 18:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Ahab and Jezebel maintained “the prophets of Baal” by which the Israelites were debauched and turned away from Jehovah. Jehovah God used Elijah to execute his judgment upon these four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal. Later, when Jehu was addressing an assembly of the people he said to them: “Ahab served Baal.” (2 Ki. 10:18) These scriptures definitely show that Ahab was given over entirely to Devil worship.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> During Ahab’s reign Jehu was an officer in his army. He was a captain and a charioteer. At the time Jehovah told Elijah that Jehu and Elisha must be anointed he also said: “Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.” (1 Ki. 19:18) It seems quite reasonable, therefore, that, although Jehu was serving in the army of Ahab, Jehu was among the seven thousand Israelites that had refused to indulge in the Devil worship or Baalism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Ahaziah succeeded his father Ahab to the throne. He was injured by a fall and he sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, meaning the Devil-god of Ekron, concerning his recovery: “And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this disease.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ange! </span><span class="font4">of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Now, therefore, thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed.”—2 Ki. 1:2-4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Jehoram (or Joram) succeeded Ahaziah to the throne; and while he was not as wicked as Ahab, still Baal worship persisted in Israel during his reign. During his reign the old woman Jezebel was still alive and she continued to sponsor the Devil worship. (2 Ki. 3:1-3) Afterwards, concerning Jehu, it is written: “Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.” (2 Ki. 10:28) At that point the Jehu picture ends. The subsequent facts recorded concerning him do not foreshadow any work done by any servant of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Jehu came in contact with the Prophet Elijah and lived through more than twenty-eight years of Elisha’s prophetic work. This would strongly support the conclusion that the company whom Jehu foreshadowed Jehovah began to gather and prepare for his name during the Elijah period of the work of the church and those proving faithful in that period he made a part of the ‘elect servant’ class. Jehovah takes away from Lucifer, now Satan, the rulership of the world and gives it to his beloved Son Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful Ruler. This great work he illustrated by taking away the kingdom from Saul and giving it to David the beloved, who foreshadowed Christ Jesus. (1 Sam. 15:28) Likewise in the picture in which Jehu appears, the Lord takes away the kingdom from Ahab and gives it to Jehu. The same rule applies to those who are given an opportunity for the kingdom and who prove unfaithful to Jehovah. ‘ ‘ Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.” (Matt. 21:43) This would show that the remnant of God’s people are embraced within the picture of the Jehu work. Jehu therefore pictured Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful King, and all of his body members sharing in the kingdom with him, and which necessarily includes the remnant, and also his holy angels who serve him always in the kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OBJECTIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Because some may raise objections to the conclusion that Jehu pictured the faithful “servant” class of Jehovah the strongest possible objections are here considered. First, the objection is made that Jehu could not be a representative of Jehovah’s “servant” because Jehu was a charioteer and a captain in the army of Ahab and also of his successor, who were Baal worshipers, and which army is that of the ten tribes of Israel which had broken off from Judah. This objection is not well taken, for the reason that God approved David<sub>4</sub> who fought in the army of the unfaithful king Saul, not because David fought in the army, but because he was faithful to Jehovah. Practically all the members of the remnant class now on the earth were once engaged more or less in the systems of “Christendom” and then honestly believed that the rulers of the hypocritical Devil-worshiping “Christendom” constituted the “higher powers” mentioned by the apostle, and to which all are admonished to give allegiance. (Rom. 13:1-4) Of course, they were wrong in that, but they were not unfaithful to God.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Another objection is raised because of Jehovah’s declaration against the house of Jehu, as uttered by his prophet, to wit: “And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.” (Hos. 1:4) This objection cannot be consistent, for the reason that this prophecy of Hosea was pronounced about fifty years after the death of Jehu. It was pronounced against “the house of Jehu” because of the wicked course taken by his son and his grandsons who succeeded him to the throne. God’s vengeance did not come upon Jehu’s house until more than eighty years after Jehu’s death; hence Jehu did not see or experience it any more than King Solomon saw Jehovah’s vengeance come upon his house, which came years after his death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Another objection is raised on the ground that during the rulership of Jehu worship was conducted in connection with the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. “Howbeit, from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.” (2 Ki. 10:29) This objection is not sound and must be overruled for the reason that Jehovah did not commission Jehu to destroy calf worship out of Israel. The golden calves set up by Jeroboam at Bethel and Dan pictured hero worship in which many of the Lord’s people ignorantly indulged and have continued to indulge until recent years because they knew no better. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> 1930, page 116.) The commission given by Jehovah to Jehu manifestly directed that he should destroy all the house of Ahab and Jezebel. (2 Ki. 9:5-10; 2 Chron. 22:7,8) That commission Jehu carried out, and after he had done so the record of his approval is given, to wit: ‘ ‘ And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.” (2 Ki. 10:30) God approved him for the faithful performance of the work he had been commissioned to do. At this point the picture of Jehu necessarily ends. The Scriptures show that God has used men in the fulfilment of his purposes even though such men were not wholly devoted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to him. An example is that of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN SUPPORT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> In support of the conclusion that Jehu pictured Jehovah’s ‘elect servant’ the following is submitted: Jehu was born under the law covenant and was therefore an Israelite, in covenant relationship with Jehovah, and which facts are shown by the Scriptures and God’s dealing with him. (2 Ki. 13:1-6; 14:23-27) The fact that he was against Baal worship is further proof that he was in the favor of the Lord God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The name “Jehu” means “Jehovah is he”. His name is emphatic in calling attention to the fact that Jehovah is he that is the Supreme One, and this is the same fact to which the “servant” class, including Jehovah's witness the remnant, now call the attention of the people. The names of his father and grandfather are also significant. Jehu was the son of Jehoshaphat, who was the son of Nimshi. (2 Ki. 9: 2,14) “Nimshi,” the name of his grandfather, means “extricated”, being probably derived from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mashah,</span><span class="font4"> the primitive root word meaning to “pull out”, and being the same root word from which the name Moses is derived. “Jehoshaphat,” the name of the father of Jehu, means “Jehovah-judged, that is, vindicated”. The latter part of the name, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shaphat,</span><span class="font4"> means ‘ ‘ to judge or pronounce judgment or sentence either for or against, and, by implication, to govern or rule and vindicate”. This Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, is not the same as Jehoshaphat mentioned in 1 Kings 15: 24 as the son of Asa. These two names therefore, Nimshi and Jehoshaphat, would represent that which is taken out or pulled out and used for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>g</sup>* It was Jehovah who gave order for the anointing of Jehu to be king over Israel, and therefore the anointing was by Jehovah. Ahab was never anointed by Jehovah. So far as the record discloses Jehu was the only man ever anointed by order of Jehovah to be king over Israel, the ten-tribe kingdom. The record is: “And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel.” (1 Ki. 19:16) Acting under instructions from the Lord, Elisha directed his young man to go and perform the anointing: “And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.”—2 Ki. 9:2, 3, 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Jehu was duly anointed and commissioned as the executioner of Jehovah to exterminate Baal, or Devil worship, in Israel. His divinely given commission reads: “And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab, thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel. For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel. And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah; and the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.”—2 Ki. 9:7-10.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Jehu fulfilled his commission. “And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab” (2 Chron. 22: 7, 8); which words prove that he was an executioner. In carrying out his commission from the Lord Jehu gained Jehovah’s “well done” or approval, and for that reason Jehovah made the covenant with Jehu that his sons should continue to reign on the throne. (2 Ki. 10: 30) This statement is that they should reign for four generations, that is to say, a foursquare or complete succession to the throne. Jehu and his house occupied the throne of Israel for a hundred years. Jehu himself reigned twenty-eight years. (2 Ki. 10: 36) Jehoahaz, his first generation, reigned for seventeen years, and during that time God favored Israel. (2 Ki. 13: 4, 5) Joash, or Jehoash, the grandson of Jehu, was on the throne of Israel at the death of Elisha, and he was favored by Jehovah’s prophet.—2 Ki. 13:14-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Jehu associated unto himself Jehonadab the son of Rechab, whose descendants, the Rechabites, won Jehovah’s favor in Jeremiah’s day. (2 Ki. 10:15,16; Jer. 35: 8,18,19) Jehu invited Jehonadab to ride in his chariot and to come with him and see his zeal for the Lord.—2 Ki. 10:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> At Mount Carmel Elijah had slaughtered four hundred and fifty of the priests of Baal; and Jehu duplicated that slaughter work, only on a far greater scale. (1 Ki. 18:40; 2 Ki. 10:18-25) Elijah made a start at the slaughter work of Baal worship, and Jehu completed that work. (2 Ki. 10:28) Another point in his favor is that Jehu was anti-Jezebel. He had and manifested the spirit similar to that of the Lord’s approved people who have and manifest the anti-Jezebel spirit, as described in Revelation 2:20-23. He rode over Jezebel in utter contempt and trampled her to death. Jehu was a vindicator of Jehovah’s word in this, that he fulfilled the word of Jehovah spoken by his prophet Elijah against Ahab and Jezebel. In this work he also completed that which Elijah had begun. Elijah had called down fire from heaven in the presence of the prophets of Baal and Ahab at Mount Carmel. His rayer was: “Hear me, O Lord, hear me; that this people may know that thou art the Lord God.” (1 Ki. 18:37) That was a vindication of Jehovah's reputation, but not sufficient to cause the ref</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ormation of </span><span class="font4">Ahab and Jezebel. Baal worship continued, and the Lord God used Jehu to vindicate his Word and his name in connection with Baal worship. (2 Ki. 9:25-37; 10: 9-11) These are merely abstract statements of historical facts showing that Jehu was used by Jehovah in performing the work of execution upon the representatives of Satan, and therefore supporting the conclusion that he foreshadowed the work of executing God’s judgment upon Satan and his organization and which the Scriptures plainly show will be done by Christ Jesus and those associated with him; hence these facts fully support the conclusion first announced as to whom Jehu foreshadowed. Other facts will be considered in the argument that follows.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ARGUMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Jehu was a fighting man. He was in the chariot corps and a captain in the army of Israel. Whenever Jehovah favored the army of Israel that army was victorious over the enemy, and hence the army became </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">was the army of the Lord of hosts; and that, being true, would make Jehu a captain in the army of the Lord of hosts. (1 Ki. 20:1-30; 2 Ki. 3:5-25; 6:24-7:16) Jehu was known and was recognized by reason of his rapid driving, because he drove “furiously”, that is, “in madness.” (2 Ki. 9:16,20, marginal reading) The fact that Jehu was associated with the war chariot of Israel seems to suggest that those who fulfil the Jehu picture must have to do and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">associated with “the chariot of the cherubims” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font4">Chron. 28:18) that pictures the colossal chariot of Jehovah’s organization, which the Prophet Ezekiel </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">saw </span><span class="font4">in vision and which the Ezekiel class understands </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">picture Jehovah’s great organization. (Ezek. 1; 10) “The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place.” (Ps. 68:17) “The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet; the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.” (Nah. 2: 3) “Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font4">thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?” (Hab. 3:8) “Who laycth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind. ’ ’—Ps. 104: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NABOTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> That Ahab and Jezebel pictured Satan and his organization is borne out by the facts. Ahab ruled over God’s covenant people, but, like Satan, he turned all his power and authority to wickedness. Jezebel, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">his woman, </span><span class="font4">pictured the “wife” or “woman” of the Devil, hence pictured the Devil’s organization. The seed of Ahab and Jezebel, therefore, would necessarily picture or represent the ‘seed of the Serpent’. Ahab </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">Jezebel, like Satan and his representatives, wore guilty of covetousness, hypocrisy, lying, stealing, commercial oppression, and murder, and brought great reproach upon the name of Jehovah by the practice of the Devil religion. There was a man, a Jezreelite, whose name was Naboth and who was the owner and possessor of a vineyard situate near the place of residence of Ahab the king. “Jezreel,” the name of the town of the residence of Naboth, means “God is planter” or “God will sow”. The name is derived from the Hebrew words meaning “God” and “seed” and appears to refer to the “seed of God”, that is to say, to his royal house which he sows and brings forth in many fold, that is to say, the seed of God according to the promise made to Abraham. (Gen. 22:15-18; John 12:24) “Naboth” means “fruits”. “And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel. And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God. ’ ’—Hos. 2: 22, 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> By Jehovah’s law of inheritance the vineyard had come into the possession of Naboth, who was therefore the lawful owner, and for this reason he desired to keep it. (Lev. 25:23; Num. 36:7) Ahab coveted that which Naboth possessed. He saw the garden, liked it, and wanted Naboth to turn it over to him, which Naboth refused to do. Ahab was displeased and reported the matter to his woman Jezebel. A conspiracy was formed against Naboth to obtain possession of his vineyard; and this conspiracy is exactly in line with others that the Devil has formed and carried out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Naboth was charged with the crime of sedition and blasphemy against God. Witnesses were hired to swear falsely against him, and upon this false testimony, produced at the instance of Jezebel, Naboth was convicted and stoned to death. Then his vineyard was seized by Ahab and Jezebel on the theory that the property of a condemned criminal reverted to the state. (1 Ki. 21:1-15) Both Ahab and Jezebel were therefore guilty of covetousness. (Ex. 20:17) By hiring witnesses to swear falsely they were guilty of hypocrisy and lying. (Ex. 20:16) By conspiring to wrongfully get possession of Naboth’s vineyard they were guilty of stealing in violation of the law. (Ex. 20:15) They were also guilty of murder, which was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">breaking of God’s everlasting covenant. (Ex. 20: 13; Gen. 9:6) Both Ahab and Jezebel were equally responsible before God for these crimes.—Num. 30: 6, 7,10,11,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Satan and his organization have repeatedly acted in a similar way toward others, and this is specially true with regard to the action of Satan and his organization toward Jesus Christ and his faithful followers. Christ Jesus is the “true vine”, and the heir of God, and the owner of the vineyard. Therefore Christ Jesus owned the vineyard by God’s law of inheritance. Jesus bore fruits unto Jehovah, even as Naboth’s name means ‘to bear fruits’; and hence Naboth foreshadowed Christ Jesus. Satan incited the Jews, and especially the clergy and other leaders, to acts of violence against Christ Jesus. This was done to gain possession of the kingdom or vineyard, that is, the ruling power. This was accomplished by the Jews’ falsely charging Jesus with sedition and blasphemy against God. Upon perjured testimony they convicted Jesus and crucified him, the method of killing him being an accursed thing, and hence it would represent that all of his possessions revert to the Devil’s organization pictured by Ahab and Jezebel. Like Jezebel, the clergy and leaders of the Jews were the chief movers in the commission of this crime against God’s beloved Son, the possessor of the vineyard. Jesus had related a parable in the presence of these clergy and leaders in Israel, the words of which show that he had in mind the very thing that was done against Naboth and which would be done concerning himself. Amongst other things he said: “But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. When the Lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.”—Matt. 21:38-43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> During the World War period the governing class of “Christendom”, at the instance of the clergy, seized God’s “servant” class, which class was then bearing fruit before the Lord, the fruit of the kingdom, and who had to do with the “true vine” of Jehovah’s vineyard, namely, Christ Jesus. These faithful followers of Christ were maltreated, charged with sedition and blasphemy, convicted upon unlawful testimony and imprisoned, and some of them killed, and the work in which they were engaged, to wit, the Elijah work, was killed or stopped. (Rev. 11:3-10) In order to hold the possession and occupancy of the imperial “vineyard” the same crowd of the Devil’s organization formed and established the League of Nations and now cause this abominable thing to “stand in the holy place”, that is to say, in the possession of that which rightfully belongs to the Lord.—Matt. 24:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> When Ahab was taking possession of the vineyard that had been stolen from Naboth God caused Elijah to go down there and meet Ahab and tell him to his face what should come upon Ahab and Jezebel, and this Elijah did. “And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession ? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, 0 mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee; because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord. Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Abijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin. And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.”—1 Ki. 21:19-24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Doubtless Ahab and Jezebel had a regiment of tho army on the spot to see that nothing should interfere with their taking over the vineyard which they had stolen after murdering Naboth. At least the facts show beyond any question that Jehu, a captain and a charioteer, was present and heard Elijah denounce Ahab. Jehu’s own words prove that fact, as appears later. (2 Ki. 9: 25, 26) It was at that time that Jehu came in contact with Elijah and heard his denunciation of Ahab and Jezebel; and this shows that the class whom Jehu pictured began to form in the time of the Elijah period of the work of the church, and the faithful ones thereof were made “the faithful and wise servant” class.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup>For some time before 1918 the Jehu picture was a much mooted question and was often considered and discussed by the Lord’s people in a desire to know what it meant. Since then God’s people have been diligently trying to ascertain the meaning thereof. God’s due time now seems to have arrived to permit his people to understand the meaning of the Jehu work. These facts further support the conclusion that Jehu, prior to the time that he was anointed, corresponded to the class pictured by Mordecai prior to the time of the selection of Esther for the place on the throne, and before Mordecai and Esther together represented the remnant of God. (Esther 2:5-7) As we are now approaching the day of the final execution of Jehovah’s vengeance upon Satan’s organization, it seems to be pleasing to the Lord to show his people the meaning of the Jehu picture and what it foreshadows; and this is further evidence that this final execution is in the very near future.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Jehu was conveniently present at Naboth’s vineyard to hear the pronouncement of God’s judgment upon Ahab and Jezebel. As Naboth had been murdered God’s declaration was that in like manner the murderers should die, and must die at the hands of the one to whom Jehovah transferred the kingdom. (1 Ki. 21:19-23) Both Elijah and Elisha knew that God had determined to transfer the kingdom from Ahab to Jehu, but Jehu did not know that fact at the time. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font4">Ki. 19:16) Jehu must wait until God’s duly appointed time for the execution of his judgment in destroying Ahab and Jezebel and then he would know, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and was so </span><span class="font4">informed. Likewise Christ Jesus must wait </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for many </span><span class="font4">centuries until God’s due time to send him forth for the vindication of his name. What part will the remnant have in the Jehu work?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 8. </span><span class="font3">Jehu’s destroying the house of Ahab was proper. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 9. </span><span class="font3">Describe (a) the Devil’s seduction of the Israelites through his representative Balaam, (b) The Lord’s judgment executed upon Israel through his servant Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font3">10. Describe how other faithful servants of Jehovah were used by him to execute judgment against his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font3">11. What is the record concerning David as to faithfulness to Jehovah? How was Jehovah’s long-suffering manifest toward the Israelites?</span></p>

Describe (a) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font3">Israel became debauched in the days of Ahab, (b) The occasion which brought the matter </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">an issue, (c) How Jehovah used his servant in the execution of his judgment upon the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font3">15. Account for Jehu’s favor with Jehovah though a servant in the army of Ahab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font3">16, 17. Who was Ahaziah? How did he incur the Lord’s judgment against him? What in this regard may be said of the reign of Jehoram?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 18. </span><span class="font3">What conclusion may be drawn from the fact that Jehu came in contact with both Elijah and Elisha and their prophetic work? Whom, therefore, did Jehu picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font3">19-21. Explain whether Jehu’s picturing Jehovah’s faithful “servant” class would be precluded (a) by his prior activities as a servant in the army of the enemy, (b) By Jehovah’s declaration regarding the house of Jehu, recorded as Hosea 1: 4. (c) By reason of what is stated concerning Jehu in the record appearing at 2 Kings 10: 29. How does a comparison of the work which Jehu performed and that which the Lord commissioned him to do, together with the Lord’s statement regarding him, absolve Jehu from responsibility for the idolatry practiced by the Israelites during his reign?</span></p>

Jehovah’s now revealing the meaning of these prophetic pictures is of what important significance? Compare Jehu’s knowledge concerning the judgment upon Ahab and Jezebel with that of Elijah and Elisha. Of what was such fact an illustration?</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CREATION OF FIRMAMENT AND LAND</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">G</span><span class="font4">OD has divided the work of the preparation of the earth for human habitation into periods of creation which he calls “days”, and which are numbered in their order from one to seven. It seems clearly proven from the sacred Scriptures, however, that the material forming the earth had been brought together and the earth formed long before the beginning of these epochs or creative days. Long before the beginning of those seven days the molten mass of our earth had thrown off great quantities of mineral substances in vapor form, and these had formed into rings in suspension around the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These great masses of hot vapors were heavy with carbon, thus causing “thick darkness” to surround the earth. Without doubt this darkness extended for </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">great number of miles beyond the earth and all around it. In the prophecy of Job there is written information concerning the beginning of the creative period which corroborates the account written in the book of Genesis; God spoke to Job and said: “Who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb? When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling-band for it, and brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors.”—Job 38:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This thick darkness extending all around the earth formed the “swaddling-band”, and corresponds to the statement in Genesis that “darkness was upon the face of the deep”. No light was then penetrating to the earth. Surrounded by numerous rings or canopies composed of heavily carbonized vapors and other mineral substances, it was impossible for the light to penetrate that thick darkness which formed a band around the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.” This statement must refer to the light that came from the heavenly sphere (or sun) illuminating the rings around the earth but not reaching the earth. Light is coexistent with Jehovah God. Concerning this it is written in God’s Word: “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1:5) “0 Lord my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain.”—Ps. 104:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sun must have been created long before the earth became a form, because the sun is the center of attraction of the solar system. Light from the sun was shining through space, but had not yet shined upon the earth because of the “swaddling-band” that surrounded it. God needs only to express his will, and things take place. The time came for the light to shine upon that which surrounded the earth. “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.”—Gen. 1:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to the beginning of the first creative day, as described by the Genesis account, some of the rings around the earth may have fallen or may not have. It is manifest, however, that many remained in suspension. With the beginning of the first creative day or period, as the scripture says, “darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is meant here by the expressions “the deep” and “the face of the waters”? Beyond a question of doubt there were waters above the earth and upon the earth. This is apparent from the Genesis statement. The great deep, therefore, must have reference to the waters above the earth, which waters could have been held up only by reason of the fact that they were revolving rapidly in an orbit about the earth. As soon as they would become inactive they would necessarily fall. The lightest one of these rings would necessarily be farthest out from the earth and nearest the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time came when the spirit of the Lord God, that is to say, his power, exercised according to his sovereign will, moved upon or took action upon the face of the waters, and the light penetrated this great deep or canopy that surrounded the earth. What it really means is that God caused the rays of the sun’s orb to shine upon the face of the waters or great deep, illuminating them. God pronounced the light good, and the light God called “day” and the darkness he called “night”, and God divided the light from the darkness. That was the beginning of the division of day and night. So far as the sacred record discloses, such constituted the work of the first creative day, which record concludes with the words: “And the evening and the morning were the first day.” There is no evidence to warrant the conclusion that at this time the light had penetrated to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visible arch of the sky, which we behold when we look aloft, is called the firmament. It is a great aerial expanse wherein are the atmosphere and ether surrounding the earth. The work of the second creative day or period was devoted to preparing this great expanse and to dividing the waters. The firmament is called “heaven” because it is high and lofty, above the earth. “And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. ’ ’—Gen. 1: 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the rings formed by rising vapors surrounding the earth necessarily contained great quantities of water, as well as carbon and other mineral substances. These revolve with greater rapidity near the equator and gradually spread out like an envelope toward the poles until they enveloped the earth as a canopy. As these rings neared the poles of the earth their motion was retarded, and both the weight and the retarded velocity caused them to fall. As each one fell, necessarily great pools of water or bodies of water were precipitated upon the earth. All the mineral substances taken up in solution were brought down at the poles and were rushed on toward the equator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There would then, of course, be water upon the earth and waters above the earth. The prophet of God sustains this conclusion in the inspired Word when he says: “Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me” (Ps. 42:7); “ Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.” (Ps. 104:6; Prov. 8:27,28; Job 38:9-11) By the falling of these aqueous rings or canopies the oceans were formed, and these great bodies on the earth were separated from the deep above the earth by the firmament. The firmament was not holding up the water; the great deep above the earth was held there by virtue of the fact that it was rapidly revolving in its orbit. In the same way a flying machine remains in the air above the earth when it is in motion, but when it stops its forward movement it falls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The firmament merely served to form a division between the waters on the earth and the great deep far out from and surrounding the earth. We understand the formation to be something like this: First the earth; then the firmament or earth’s atmosphere; and beyond that many rings containing heavy carbon and other minerals and sublimations, the lighter rings containing hydro-carbons being still farther from the earth, and the outermost ring being principally water. The firmament above the earth God called “heaven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was during the third creative day or epoch that the dry land appeared. Men have advanced different theories as to the process of bringing forth the dry land. The land might have been brought forth by pressure of water causing some portions to sink and others to rise, or it might have been caused by waters running down into the crevices of the heated rock, which caused great upheavals. However it was done, the Lord God’s statement is that it was done according to his will. There the controversy ends. God then gathered together the waters on the earth in order that other portions of the earth might be free from water, as it is written: “And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. ’ ’—Gen. 1: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the first time the Scriptures here mention waters upon the earth as seas. The Scriptural proof, therefore, is conclusive that there was a great deep above the earth, separate and distinct from the waters upon the earth. The waters above the earth are designated in the Scriptures as “the deep”; whereas the waters upon the earth are called the “seas” or oceans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preparatory work progressed. The dry land did not appear suddenly, but gradually; and doubtless the appearing covered a large part of the third creative day. During that period the earth brought forth grass and herbs, each yielding seed and fruit after his own kind. One kind of seed did not develop another kind of seed; but each kind produced its own seed, which seed in due course produced other grass and herbs. “And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit,- whose seed is in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.”— Gen. 1:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the canopies or rings surrounding the earth the heat and conditions upon the earth were conducive to the growth of plants and herbs. It seems that the plant formation during that period grew rapidly and very large. Some geologists claim that it is from these plants of prodigious growth that the coal beds were formed; that these plants and mosses were covered with sand and clay, and that in the course of time coal beds resulted. Others advance a much more reasonable theory, to wit, that the incandescent or molten mass forming the earth threw off great quantities of vapor charged with carbon, which vapors formed rings or canopies about the earth each of which contained great quantities of carbon; that these rings falling at different intervals of time upon the earth caused the deposit of great quantities of carbon; and that thereby the coal beds were formed, which are found today in the earth at different depths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coal is carbon. It follows conclusively that the smoke and gas passing off from the earth contained carbon, and it would be much more reasonable that when these returned to the earth such deposits of carbon formed the coal fields than that this carbon was first converted into plants and then plants formed carbon fields. Great quantities of carbon are found in the oldest beds of the earth, which of necessity existed before any plants were known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It also seems reasonable that the petroleum or rock oil comes from the same source. All these elements were in the igneous or fiery rock before being thrown off from the earth; and the same reasonable deduction is that coal and oil in the earth were formed from deposits made by the falling of the rings, long before there was any plant or vegetation on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The weight of authority does not support the theory that the coal and oil beds were laid down by the perishing of vegetables or animal life, but that these elements were in the igneous rock mass and were placed there by the great Creator. When carried off as a vapor which formed the rings around the earth these in due time fell and were deposited in the various parts of the earth, forming the coal beds and oil fields at different depths. Instead, therefore, of these being formed in the third creative day or epoch it seems quite reasonable to conclude that they were formed prior thereto.—See Isaac N. Vail’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Earth’s Annular System,</span><span class="font4"> pages 398,399.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>VICTORY THROUGH OBEDIENCE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">R</span><span class="font4">EVILING, mockery, the most cruel and hateful persecution ever heaped upon a man, all of these were endured by Jesus when upon earth. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">When he </span><span class="font4">had finished his good work he was cruci</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fied. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus, when upon earth, was the target for the poisonous darts of God’s enemy, Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An attempt was made to kill Jesus even before Mary gave birth to the babe. Satan was behind that attempt. Then an attempt was made by Herod to have the child Jesus destroyed, and to carry out his pur</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">poses he </span><span class="font4">caused all the children of Bethlehem of two years and under to be killed. (Matt. 2:16) The master mind of Satan arranged that scheme for the destruction of the child. When Satan found that he was </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">unable </span><span class="font4">to turn Jesus away from his course of righteousness and complete devotion to his Father, then he instituted a system of cruel persecution against him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">could have prevented it, but he permitted it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From and after the day of Enos, when the people under Satan’s supervision in derision and mockery called themselves by the name of the Lord, Satan continued to reproach God. When Jehovah sent his beloved Son into earth and anointed him to be King or Ruler, then Satan heaped upon the Son the reproaches which he had heaped upon the Father. It is written: “I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”—Ps. 69: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was born a Jew subject to the terms of the law covenant with the Jews. God sent him to the Jews to do a work in connection with his coming government, and particularly to inform the Jews thereof. The leaders of Israel, to wit, the clergy and-the principal ones of their flocks, led the persecutions against Jesus; and Satan was the super-mind behind it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were some faithful Jews who acknowledged Jesus as the Anointed One of God, and to them was extended God’s special favor: ‘‘He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” (John 1:11,12) The others put forth their best efforts to make his existence burdensome and to destroy him. These experiences of Jesus were in exact accord with what had been prophesied of and concerning him. “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.”—Isa. 53: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was perfect, holy, harmless, and without sin, and he did harm to no one. The fact that he was despised and persecuted is proof that Satan the wicked one was causing the persecution and for the reason that Jesus was anointed to be the Ruler of the world. Jesus had a message of special importance to the Jews that would be beneficial to them. They were his brethren and he came to help them. Satan induced them to despise and reject and persecute him. Bear in mind always that those men whom Satan used to lead the persecution against Jesus, and who caused him great sorrow and suffering, were the clergymen of that time, who claimed to be the representatives of God. This proves that the clergymen and the principal of their flock were the sons of the Devil and not the sons of God. Jesus plainly told them that they were of the Devil, as we read in John 8, verses forty-three and forty-four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was a “man of sorrows and acquainted with grief”; and one reason was that he saw men who claimed to represent his Father, but who were daily misrepresenting him and slandering his holy name, and were heaping ignominy upon Jesus because he came from God and represented him on earth. Those instruments of Satan hated Jesus without a just cause </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or excuse for so</span><span class="font4"> doing. ‘ ‘ They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.” —Ps. 69:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God through his holy prophets had repeatedly told the Jews of the coming of the One whom Moses and David foreshadowed. Now Jesus had come in fulfilment of these prophetic utterances. He furnished ample evidence for the leaders of Israel to know that he was God’s Anointed. These Jewish clergymen were familiar with the law and the prophets, and yet they continued to persecute Jesus and laid upon him all manner of reproaches. They accused Jesus of being a glutton and a winebibber and a sinner because he drank and ate according to his needs and because he showed some kindness to publicans and sinners. (Matt. 11:19) Because Jesus relieved some of the people of their sufferings, which the Devil had caused to come upon them, by casting out demons, the clergy accused Jesus of being the chief of devils. (Matt. 12: 24) They accused him of blasphemy because he told them the truth concerning himself which they should have known by reading the prophecies.—John 10: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Jesus spoke a parable to the clergy, which parable was in fact a prophecy and was to the effect that Jehovah had planted a vineyard and entrusted it to the Jews, particularly the leaders in Israel; that Jehovah had sent his prophets to them and they had beaten and stoned and killed them; and that now at last he had sent to them his Son, and when they saw the Son these evil-minded men had said: ‘Let us kill him and seize the inheritance.’ (Matt. 21: 33-41) To be sure, Satan induced this persecution of Jesus by and through the clergy, and Jesus was telling them that they were so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan could use the clergy because they had forsaken God and had yielded to the invisible rulership of the Devil. They preferred the approval of men and enjoyment of the little power they had to being faithful to God. Although they claimed to represent God, they were in truth the representatives of the Devil, as Jesus told them; and because he told them the truth they sought to kill him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For more than three years the relentless persecution </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Jesus continued, and at the end of his earthly ministry the representatives of the people of Israel, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">wit, the clergy, profiteers, and politicians, entered into a conspiracy to have Jesus put to death. (Matt. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">26: </span><span class="font4">3-5) Carrying out that conspiracy they caused the arrest of Jesus, brought forth false witnesses, held a session of court contrary to their own law, compelled the accused to give testimony against himself contrary to their law; and without any true evidence and without any just cause or excuse Jesus was convicted, sentenced and then put to an ignominious death by being hanged upon the tree. He died as though he was a sinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophet had written the words that were in Jesus’ mouth: “Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee. Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.”—Ps. 69:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Could not Jehovah God have prevented the persecution and suffering and ignominious death of his beloved Son? To be sure, Jehovah could have, because he is almighty: his power knows no limitation. Why then did the Almighty God permit his Son to be persecuted and thus to suffer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inspired witness answers the question: ‘ ‘ Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” (Heb. 5:8) Again God would emphasize the importance of obedience. In the days of Saul God had said through his prophet: “To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.”—1 Sam. 15:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God had anointed his son Lucifer to be a covering cherub, and that son had proven unfaithful and disloyal. God had now anointed his beloved Son Jesus to be the Head of the great government of righteousness which he would establish; and before he would exalt him to the high position of actual rulcrship God would prove his beloved Son by permitting him to be subjected to the most severe trials. The persecutions that were heaped upon him afforded the opportunity for him to learn obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font4">these experiences Jesus did learn obedience and proved his worthiness to be folly and forever entrusted with the work before him. Jesus was so thoroughly devoted to his Father and to the work set before him that he said: “I can of mine own self do nothing.” (John 5:30) That did not mean that he had no ability to do, but that his covenant with Jehovah would permit him to do nothing contrary to God’s holy will. Thus he emphasizes the lesson God would teach all his intelligent creatures: that obedience is of the greatest importance. Those who fail to obey fall to the influence of the wicked one, and their stubbornness in refusing to obey orders is lawlessness that leads to devil worship. This rule’s being so thoroughly and completely established in the experience of Jesus in preparing him for his exalted position is conclusive proof that God will require obedience of every one whom he exalts. To this end it is written: “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace [favor] to the humble [obedient].”—1 Pet. 5: 6, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul under inspiration states that Jesus did not seek to grasp more than was intended for him nor did he take a course contrary to God’s will. He was willingly submissive to his Father’s will, and knowing that no trials and persecutions and sufferings could come to him without his Father’s permission, he gladly submitted thereto. It brought upon him great suffering and sorrow and it led to an ignominious death. But by all these experiences he learned to be obedient, and because he thus learned obedience Jehovah exalted him to the highest place in the universe. “Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, . . . being made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross. 'Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.’’—Phil. 2:5-11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was put to death on the tree, was taken down and buried, and on the third day God raised him up out of death. Forty days thereafter Jesus ascended into heaven. As King or Ruler of God’s righteous government will Christ Jesus, the Anointed One, be visible or invisible to men? He will be invisible, because he was put to death as a man and raised out of death a spirit. (1 Pet. 3:18) Human eyes cannot behold a spirit. To man a spirit creature is like the wind. Man can see the effects of the wind and can hear it and feel it; but he cannot, by the' exercise of the human sense of sight, see the wind itself. That is in substance what Jesus told Nicodemus concerning spirit creatures. (John 3: 5-8) Jesus was born of the spirit at his resurrection out of death. He afterward appeared to his disciples in human form and in different bodies. Manifestly the body for each appearance was created for the purpose. He did not appear, however, at any time in his glorious spirit body. Paul came the nearest of anyone to seeing his glorious body. Paul saw only the reflection of the light therefrom, and the brightness of that light exceeded the brightness of the sun at midday. (Acts 9:3; 26:13) This is exactly in harmony with what Jesus said to his disciples concerning men of the world as to seeing him: “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more.”—John 14:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">May it fall on your good pleasure to afford this intrusion on your valuable time. Some time ago I heard the people outlining the marvelous work of disclosure sanctioned by the Lord under your figure and toil. Under the undue influence of the Devil I paid no earlier attention to the vital message, but had been an out-and-out Protestant church-goer, reading the Bible to no good end of understanding and feeling thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This is the day I put full stop to membership in this church and declare it an unwholesome alliance and a mere club to entertain Satan the Devil, the enemy of man and his Creator. I am utterly convinced by comment on the Scripture to me by a friend serving as an auxiliary on your faith and exposition of the Bible, the only means of comfort and hope of man. I had to be enlightened of the privilege and wisdom bestowed by the Creator of the Universe on you and the Society as a whole to function with superb devotion in the spirit of the Lord, that you are in position to advertise comfort for the world of sin, depression, calamity and sadness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The friend spares books from you, and really I feel something remarkable of accuracy in the work. Surely I cannot refrain from saying, God is love I and God loves you greatly I I regret greatly the inimical church-veil in front of my eyes heretofore. Oh, yes! I am glad at you as a physician who is expert enough to give accurate prescription for my ill health. The competent physician is ever the favorite of the sick. We feel the increasing oppression rising to the boiling point in this and the other countries. Undoubtedly nobody other than Jehovah’s faithful witnesses can tell the cause. I have gathered from the strength of Jehovah’s witnesses to my entire belief that Satan is unwilling to abdicate and the people are trustful in the ruling power of the present organization; hence the unusual perplexity in the affairs of men growing worse and worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At this critical juncture the problems can be solved only by the party in good harmony with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thanks are due to you and the Society in proving worthy to comfort the obedient of the world. The Bible being the only source from which the way out can be inferred by the meek, may the Lord suffer us to shun the enemy organization and to cheer the Gallant Prince who wins in final.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am particularly desirous to own myself the books 1 listed on the separate paper. I crave to be fed by Truth through you. May you have no objection to my addressing the first letter to you direct. I need introduction to the system as laid down by you to entertain foreign correspondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May I be favored by your attention to comment and enlighten me of the terms and periods stated in the prophecy of Daniel 9: 24-27 as to the correspondency in time applicable thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dear brother in the Lord, I do love you with the Society, and value your God-given service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your obedient servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A. A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Evortefe, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gold Coast, Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“DELIGHT TO SERVE OUR GOD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Our dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is indeed with great pleasure that we drop you a few lines to let you know that the company here were unanimous in their vote of accepting God’s loving gift to us of our new name, and our old sign (I.B.S.A.) has been taken down and our new name put in its place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We also realize that we must not take the name of the Lord in vain; so we are endeavoring to go out in a solid front as witnesses, not through fear, however, but we delight to serve our God because we have entered into the joy of the Lord and delight to keep his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We also realize that the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is God’s organization on earth, and also that all the truth that Jehovah God has given us has come to us through </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> We know that the kingdom has been born, that Jesus has come to his temple, and that he wants us to give this witness; therefore we go forth to mark all the sheep class before the great slaughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Oh, what joy is ours now, and will be through all eternity, to sing forth his praises!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your loving brother by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilbert</span><span class="font3"> E. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Houseman.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canada.</span></p>
