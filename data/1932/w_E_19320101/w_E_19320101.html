<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>KNOW JEHOVAH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“They shall know that I am Jehovah.”—Ezek. 6:10, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH causes his purposes to be accomplished in his due time. His Word makes it quite clear that his time has come when the people must be given an opportunity to know that Jehovah is God. Such knowledge is of paramount importance to all the human race. The above text from Ezekiel 6:10 is the text selected for the year 1932. The text and the context involve Christendom, the millions now living that will never die, and God’s people now on earth which constitute his remnant. The text and the context disclose God’s purpose to destroy Christendom, to preserve alive on earth a certain class of people of good will, and that the obligation is laid upon the remnant to make these facts known to the people now. Jehovah is now giving his anointed ones an understanding of his prophecy by Ezekiel. More than sixty times in that prophecy the phrase appears: “Ye [or, they] shall know that I am Jehovah.” In this manner he emphasizes and magnifies the importance of knowledge of and concerning the Most High. Since the Scriptures were written for the special aid and benefit of the remnant now on the earth, the remnant should receive this as meat in due season from the Lord. In times past it was thought that the chief duty of the consecrated one is to make himself ready for the heavenly kingdom. Such is important, but there are other things of even greater importance. The remnant must now be faithful in the performance of the obligation Jehovah has laid upon them. The remnant must inform themselves of and concerning such obligation Jehovah has laid upon them. The remnant must inform themselves of and concerning such obligation, because knowledge must precede faith and faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MEANING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The root word from which the word “know” is derived, as used in the year text, has a variety of meanings. It means to receive knowledge of and concerning Jehovah; to recognize Jehovah as he is; to perceive and to understand him. It also means to have respect for Jehovah, to be sure and to be assured by reason of the knowledge received. The language of the text is mandatory: “they </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shall</span><span class="font4"> know that I am Jehovah.” Finally no one will be able to truthfully say that he never had an opportunity to know Jehovah God; for it is the will of God that all men shall be brought to an accurate knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim. 2:4-6) The sea is confined between the dry land, and all persons have knowledge that the waters cover the sea. The time must come when the peoples of the earth shall have a general knowledge of Jehovah God’s glory even as they now have a general knowledge of the deep. “For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.” (Hab. 2:14, A.R.V.) The context here shows that this prophecy has its primary fulfilment during the execution of Jehovah’s judgment against Satan’s organization. A knowledge of the glory of Jehovah means a manifestation of himself particularly as expressed by his power. All the peoples of the earth shall see a manifestation of Jehovah’s majesty and power in the great battle of the day of God Almighty. The text does not say that they shall all know Jehovah, but it does say that a knowledge of his glory shall be as apparent as that the waters cover the sea. Not everyone who receives such knowledge will profit thereby. By his course of action the fool will reject all knowledge concerning Jehovah; “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 14:1) The fool is self-important and self-sufficient in his own eyes. In his estimation he is always right, but the fact is he is always wrong. (Prov. 12:15) The fool despises God’s instruction. (Prov. 15:5) He cannot and will not have an understanding, because he rejects knowledge. (Ps. 92:6) It is the man who learns wisdom that will profit by receiving knowledge. “Wisdom is too high for a fool.” (Prov. 24:7) The Scriptures clearly teach that there are some who will learn wisdom, and these are they who are glad to receive knowledge. “When the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.” (Prov. 21:11) “A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels.” (Prov. 1:5) “When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul, discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee; to deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things.” (Prov. 2:10-12) Therefore the Lord God announces to those who desire to hear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.”— Prov. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The Scriptures abundantly support the conclusion that just preceding the execution of God’s judgment against Satan’s organization on earth there must be a proclamation of the truth concerning Jehovah ; that many will then prove themselves to be fools, will not hear and will die, while others will be wise, accept a knowledge of the truth of and concerning Jehovah God and will live; and that the remnant on earth, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, must bear this message of truth and give testimony before the people. The year text, therefore, will have the careful consideration by the remnant, because these desire to know the will of God and then to joyfully do his will. Jehovah’s witnesses will tell the people that Jehovah is God.—Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO IS JEHOVAH GOD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘That question was propounded by the ruler of Egypt to Moses. Many rulers of the world propound the same question now because they are just as ignorant as Pharaoh was concerning Jehovah God. Doubtless many of these do not know that they are the servants of Satan. Most of them are wise in their own conceits, trust in themselves and their organized power, and are therefore fools. (Prov. 28:26) Now darkness is upon the rulers of the earth, and gross darkness upon the people; and it is the time when the remnant must shine by declaring the name and the works of Jehovah God. (Isa. 60:1, 2) It is quite manifest that the Lord has caused his angels to gather out from his kingdom the offenders and the workers of iniquity. He has separated his truly faithful ones from the others. The Lord God has brought those who love him into his secret place. He has given to them a new name which his own mouth has named. He has branded them so that their identity can be easily discovered. These are not righteous within themselves, but they are counted righteous by reason of being in Christ and wholly devoted to Jehovah God’s cause. Therefore these must now fulfil the announcement of the Lord that the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. (Matt. 13:43) Their shining is by reason of being Jehovah’s sons and his witnesses and proclaiming his works and his name and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> It is certain that God will now have information brought to the peoples of earth concerning himself, and that those who are wise will receive that information and live. It is the duty and great privilege of the remnant to give answer to the people to the question “Who is Jehovah God?” Let this be done in kind and simple speech. The peoples of earth are in great perplexity and in much distress. It is the time to comfort with the truth those who will hear. Ask such to bear with you while you briefly relate the cause of the world distress and the sure remedy God has provided therefor. In substance say: “All the beautiful things you see in nature were created by the Eternal One, whose name is God. He is also the only true and almighty God, and his power knows no limitation. He also bears the name of Jehovah, which specifically signifies his purposes toward his creatures. One of his names is the Most High, because he is above all and over all and all creation must willingly make themselves subject to him. His time has come to have the people informed of his purposes, and I am just one of Jehovah’s witnesses to bring to you this message of truth. By this means we are now preaching the gospel of the kingdom according to his commandment. We are not attempting to get any person into an earthly organization. Our responsibility is to tell the people the truth. The greatest crisis of the ages is now here. But even greater distress for the world is just ahead. Those who will hear and heed the truth will have Jehovah’s favor. The details of this important message now due for the people are set forth in these certain books which give all the Scriptural citations and enable you to study and to prove that these things are true and correct. The times are hard, and money is very scarce, with the poor especially; but you will be well repaid by denying yourself something, even some necessary food for a time, that you might have an understanding of God’s purposes. Such will enable you to see what is in the immediate future and what course you should take for your own well-being. This is not man’s message, but it is the message from Jehovah God’s Word, set forth especially for the benefit of those now at the end of the world who will hear and obey.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PURPOSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• What is the primary purpose of informing the people concerning Jehovah? The purpose of first importance is that Jehovah’s name may be vindicated before all creation, and, second, that all men by giving heed and obedience to Jehovah’s will may receive everlasting life in happiness. Mankind must now be informed of and concerning the great issue or question that is to be settled right and for ever, and that issue specifically involves the word and name of Jehovah God. God created man a perfect creature. (Deut. 32:4) The imperfection of man is due to his alienation from God. His perfection and happiness can be regained only by man’s giving his full allegiance to Jehovah God and following the way God has provided through Jesus Christ for redemption and deliverance of mankind. The first man was made in the image and likeness of God and was given the opportunity to choose to obey God and live or to disobey him and die. It was that original disobedience that brought all men into the present unhappy condition. If man is returned to God he must have knowledge of and concerning God and the divine means employed for man’s recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ When Satan rebelled and men followed him in disobedience of God’s law Satan hurled defiance into the face of the great Creator. He challenged the word and the name of Jehovah God. Satan declared that God could not put men on earth who would remain true and faithful to him and therefore maintain their integrity toward God. Jehovah God had previously declared his purpose to have man inherit the earth which he had made for man’s benefit. In defiance of Jehovah and in contradiction of his word Satan put at issue the name Jehovah. That Satan did by denying that the Creator could carry out his purpose. Satan also put at issue Jehovah’s word by challenging the truthfulness of that word and declaring God to be a liar. (Gen. 1:26-28; 2:17; 3:4,5; Isa. 45:12,18) The question then raised was, Who is supreme? Who is the almighty and true God? To be sure, Jehovah God is, was and ever shall be supreme; yet Satan has arrogantly denied this eternal truth and has induced the major portion of mankind to turn away from God. Instead of destroying Satan immediately God gave Satan the opportunity to prove his challenge. In keeping with his almighty power, his justice, wisdom and unselfishness, Jehovah God in substance said to the enemy: ‘ Take plenty of time and put forth your greatest efforts and prove if you can that my name and my word are unworthy of full confidence and that I am not supreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> During the sixty centuries that have elapsed since the rebellion in Eden Satan has builded a mighty and powerful organization. He has assembled a multitude of spirit creatures that have done his bidding. He has erected great world powers and caused the people to support a cruel and oppressive military system that has kept them under the oppressor’s strong hand. He has seduced and debauched the people by the religious worship of creatures, and in mockery has taken over the religious organization that bears the name of Jehovah’s beloved Son. He has used all manner of fraud, deceit, lying and force to blind the people and turn them away from God, their true friend and benefactor. The result is that the whole world lies under the wicked one. (1 John 5:19) In that period of time Jehovah God has from time to time brought his name before the people that those of faith and who love righteousness might be permitted to choose the right way. In the exercise of their free moral agency almost all men have chosen to follow in the way of unrighteousness. Only a few have chosen the way of righteousness and truth, and Satan has desperately attempted to destroy these. Satan has gone the limit of his power. He has done all possible in him to sustain his defiance and his challenge of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* In 1914 Jehovah God in substance said to his beloved Son: ‘Satan has reached his limit. Go now and oust him from heaven, and rule.’ (Ps. 110:1, 2) Cast out of heaven and down to the earth Satan now must confine his operations to the earth. (Rev. 12:12) This he is doing and is piling upon the people all manner of burdens, causing them great distress, perplexity and suffering, and using the clergy of his wicked religious organization to induce the people to believe that Jehovah God is the cause of their suffering and distress. There is but one way to for ever settle the great issue of supremacy, and that way is the destruction of Satan and his organization. Such will vindicate Jehovah’s name and will lift the burden from the backs of the people and remove blindness from their eyes that all mankind may have a full and clear opportunity to choose the way of righteousness that leads to everlasting life. Man must have knowledge before he can choose. If there will be some carried through the great battle of the day of God Almighty, then they must have some knowledge prior thereto in order that they may take their place on the side of Jehovah and receive his protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW OBTAINED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> How may the people obtain knowledge of and concerning Jehovah? They must learn that the Bible is Jehovah God’s Word of truth and then rely upon it for information and guidance. Man can be established on the side of the Lord God only by the truth; and the Scriptures, as it is written, constitute the truth. “Thy word is truth.’’ (John 17:17) Man’s opinion is not a safe guide unless fully supported by the Word of God. The Scriptures furnish the true guide for man. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.’’ (Ps. 119:105) “Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.’’ (2 Tim. 3:16,17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> While these Scriptural texts apply primarily to the church, they also furnish a guide for every man who will be reconciled to God and live. The people must be informed that the promise of Jehovah is that he will give greater light and a clearer understanding of his Word to those people upon earth at the end of the world, where we now are. (1 Cor. 10:11) Clearly it is the will of God that books be published setting forth where in the Bible these truths may be found, and that the facts shall be set out alongside the Scripture texts; which facts have come to pass in recent years, and which are of general knowledge to all the people. This must be done that the people may determine not only that divine prophecy is true, but that it is now in course of fulfilment. Faith in Jehovah as the only true God is absolutely essential, and no one can have faith without knowledge. Faith is obtained by hearing and relying upon the Word of God; but someone must tell the people the truth in order that they may call upon the name of the Lord. This work of bearing testimony to the people of and concerning God he has delegated to those whom he has named his “witnesses” and who are the feet members of Christ, and about whom it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!” (Rom. 10:13-17) By and through the Word of God and his manner of dealing with the people is the Lord’s means provided for the people to obtain a knowledge that they now so much need.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NECESSITY OF KNOWLEDGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> &quot;Why is knowledge of and concerning Jehovah God necessary? For many centuries the church organizations have taught it was necessary only to know about Jesus, and little or nothing has been said about Jehovah. The time has come for Jehovah to exalt his name, and therefore the people must know about him. A knowledge of and concerning Jehovah is necessary, because he is the Life-giver of all creatures. Since man has the privilege of choosing he could not choose without having some knowledge of what to choose. Jehovah’s way that leads men to life is by and through Christ Jesus. There is no other way, and it is Jehovah God’s way. (Acts 4:12) Jehovah has given Christ Jesus power over all human creation, and Jesus said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Primarily these words applied to the disciples of Jesus. Later they applied to all who become the followers of Christ Jesus; and now they apply to those who shall be carried through the great battle of Armageddon and be the first recipients of restitution blessings. Clearly it is now necessary for the remnant to have a knowledge of the fulfilment of prophecy, and for this reason Jehovah is giving to them that love him such knowledge. This favor is granted to the faithful in order that they may with patience push on with the work that the Lord has given them to do, even though amidst great opposition, and that in so doing they may be comforted with the assurance that they are doing right and therefore doing God’s will. (Rom. 15:4) Hence the increase of knowledge at the end of the world.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Knowledge of and concerning God is necessary for those in Christendom who shall be spared and carried through the great battle of the day of God Almighty. To the teachable ones on earth Jehovah now says: “Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek [teachable ones] of the earth ... : it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.” (Zeph. 2:3, A.R.V.) The very language of this text proves that the people must first have some knowledge before they can seek meekness and righteousness. They must learn that Jehovah is God, the supreme and eternal One. They will require some knowledge now; and when Jehovah by his mighty one Christ Jesus dashes to pieces the organization of Satan, the people that survive will then know that Jehovah is God and that his power is supreme and absolute. When that judgment of righteous indignation is past, then the survivors will need and will desire much more knowledge. (Jer. 50:5) The destruction of Satan’s organization and his complete overthrow will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The bringing of men through the day of Jehovah’s wrath, and which men then walk in the way of righteousness, will also be in vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah declares that it is his purpose that before the great destruction takes place the rulers of Christendom shall be notified thereof. The serving of such notice will bring knowledge to those who will heed that Jehovah is God, and will enable those who will choose so to do to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and live. The people must therefore be made acquainted with the name of Jehovah. “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” (Prov. 18:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Those who hear, heed and obey the Lord Jehovah will become righteous. “To make [his] name known to [his] adversaries” Jehovah will cause his fires of destruction to burn up Satan’s organization, and then those who have learned of his name and who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah will be saved. (Isa. 64:2) It will be those who walk in the name of Jehovah our God that shall receive his blessings of everlasting life.—Mic. 4: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Now the people are greatly oppressed. Distress marks the faces of all aside from the people who trust in the Lord God. In general the people are in great perplexity and know not what to do. The time of trouble is on the world, even though the worst part thereof has not been reached. The words of the Lord, therefore, are now appropriate, as are written: “And he will judge the world in righteousness, he will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness. Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.” (Ps. 9:8-10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> The context shows that this prophecy applies at the present time, when Christ is at the temple of Jehovah for judgment. Therefore the present is the time when Jehovah will make it possible for the peoples of good will to receive some knowledge of him and of his Word and of his name. Who will be the privileged ones to bear such message of consolation to the people? Jehovah’s witnesses are the ones to whom the testimony is committed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Knowledge received increases the responsibility of those who receive it. Since the coming of Christ to the temple of Jehovah and the gathering unto himself of the approved ones these have been favored with greater knowledge. The time specifically relates to the completion or finishing of “the mystery of God”. Since then the anointed have learned the meaning of Jehovah’s name, have understood much about his great organisation, and have clearly discerned the great issue that must now be settled. They have learned that Satan has a powerful organization which God will soon destroy to the vindication of his own great name. John who was privileged to write down the Revelation pictured or represented the faithful anointed ones of God now on the earth. In that picture the mighty Messenger of Jehovah appears with ‘a little book in his hand’. The anointed servant class is commanded to go and take the little book and eat it up. ‘ ‘ And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.” (Rev. 10:10,11) The “little book” is that which pertains to the purposes of Jehovah concerning his people and their work, and which purposes are now due to be understood by those who love him. The eating of the little book means the acquiring of a knowledge by the anointed ones of and concerning Jehovah and his purposes. It is the revelation of his mystery. Divine wisdom resulted to the anointed ones by ‘eating that little book’. (Prov. 24:13,14) Such knowledge properly received has a purifying effect, and purification resulted. Such has made known to the anointed that henceforth they must have and pursue a singleness of purpose, and that to be wholly devoted to God and his kingdom and to do the will of the Most High. As soon as this little book was eaten it became bitter in the belly of the ones eating the same; otherwise stated, the divine knowledge and wisdom received therefrom was sweet to the taste of the anointed and quickly gave bitterness to them by arousing a bitter indignation against Satan and his organization. These faithful ones resolved by the grace of the Lord to do whatsoever he would have them to do against Satan and his organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Is it proper for the anointed to pray for the destruction of Satan’s organization<sup>1</sup>? It is certain that, when the Lord God causes a prayer to be recorded by his prophet, which prophet represents the anointed servant class, it is the will of God that such anointed ones shall pray the prayer thus recorded. Therefore, when the righteous indignation and bitterness of Jehovah’s anointed servant arose against Satan and his organization because of the great defamation heaped upon God’s name, then it was due time, and it was the will of God, that the anointed ones pray (and they have prayed) for the destruction of Satan’s organization, in these words: “0 God, keep not thou silence; hold not thy peace, and be not still, 0 God. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. 0 my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind. As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire, so pursue them with thy tempest, and terrify them with thy storm. Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek thy name, 0 Jehovah. Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish; that they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83:1-3; 13-18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Ezekiel and John represented the same class, to wit, God’s anointed servant class on earth. The “little book” mentioned in the tenth chapter of Revelation is the same as the “roll” mentioned by Ezekiel and which he did eat. (Ezek. 2: 8-10; 3:2) The praying of the prayer, as set forth in the eighty-third Psalm, and a like prayer which appears in Isaiah 64:1, would not bring the expression of God’s wrath any earlier; but it puts the servant of Jehovah in the proper attitude of heart to joyfully obey God’s commandments in cooperating and in carrying out his will. Therefore Jehovah speaks to the anointed servant whom Ezekiel represented and expresses his will concerning such in these words: ‘ ‘ Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. Nevertheless, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.” (Ezek. 3:17-19,21) Thus Jehovah God lays the responsibility upon the servant class. These are made Jehovah’s witnesses to deliver a warning and a testimony. As Jehovah said to Ezekiel, so now he says to his witnesses of and concerning Christendom: “And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.”— Ezek. 2: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Jehovah has announced his judgment against Christendom, which decree declares that Christendom shall be destroyed. It is the most spectacular, hypocritical and wicked part of Satan’s visible organization. It has brought the greatest amount of shame and ignominy upon the name of Jehovah and to Christendom; therefore Jehovah says: “In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations; and they shall know that I am the Lord. ’ ’—Ezek. 6: 6,7,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> In Christendom there are many who sigh and cry for the abominations that are practiced therein and because of the oppressions that are heaped upon them. These desire to know what is right, that they may go in the right way. Their cries have reached unto the God of battle; and true to his promise he will send them a message of consolation, that they may escape. For the guidance of his anointed servant class Jehovah now says: “Yet will I leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries. And they that escape of you shall remember me.’’ (Ezek. 6: 8, 9) These must now have an opportunity to learn of and concerning Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah God has gathered out from the nations a people for his name. To these thus gathered he has given a new name, and the faithful must and will prove that the name properly belongs to them. No longer are these concerned about ascertaining what is the will of God as to what they shall do. His will he has plainly expressed, and they know that they must do the work that the Lord has laid out for them to do. Those who are Jehovah’s witnesses are “the sheep of his pasture” and especially under his protection and care. By his grace they have entered upon the “high road” and have their faces and their hearts turned wholly to the kingdom. They delight to take the lead in turning the people to Jehovah God by telling them of his name and his Word. Their slogan now is: “They shall know that Jehovah is God.” They now are determined that, by his grace, this information they will carry to the people. Marching in the van of those now on earth who love righteousness these faithful witnesses of Jehovah are singing: “Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands. Serve Jehovah with gladness; come before his presence with singing. Know ye that Jehovah, he is God; it is he that hath made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise; give thanks unto him, and bless his name. For Jehovah is good; his loving-kindness endureth for ever, and his faithfulness unto all generations.” —Ps. 100, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah has stretched forth his mighty arm to make righteousness known in the earth. Those who now gladly hear the words of truth and who turn to Jehovah and learn to know him shall receive his blessings, as promised: “Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound; they walk, 0 Jehovah, in the light of thy countenance. In thy name do they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteousness are they exalted. ’ ’ —Ps. 89:15,16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The little band whom God has gathered out from amongst the nations as a people for his name are greatly blessed with an opportunity to be his witnesses. Of and concerning them it is written: * ‘ This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.” (Isa. 43: 21) The name of Jehovah God shall now be exalted and forever praised. Let the faithful ones now ever keep before them the declaration: “They shall know that Jehovah is God.”</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES • HOW LONG?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH GOD’S prophet Isaiah, speaking under inspiration, once said: “Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.” (Isa. 8:18) Zion is the name of God’s organization. The words “Lord of hosts” always refer to Jehovah preparing for or going into battle. None </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">dwell</span><span class="font4"> in Zion until Zion is built up. (Ps. 102:16) The prophecy therefore shows that Isaiah and his children stood as types or sign men, foretelling the class of faithful witnesses in the world at the time that Jehovah is preparing to battle against the enemy, and after Zion is built up. This prophecy therefore locates the time as after the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, when the Lord came to his temple. Isaiah tells that he had a vision in which he saw Christ the King seated upon his throne in the temple, and with him his holy messengers. That time is fixed when the Lord appears at his temple with his holy angels for judgment. (Mal. 3:1-3; Matt. 25:31) Concerning his vision Isaiah says: “And one [of the seraphim] cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord [Jehovah] of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.”—Isa. 6: 3, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being a type of spiritual Israel, Isaiah, by saying that he ‘is a man of unclean lips’, would clearly mean that there was a negligence on the part of God’s people in giving testimony. The work of the church foretold by the Prophet Elijah ceased in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, and the work foreshadowed by the Prophet Elisha began about nineteen hundred and nineteen. During the interval God’s people on earth were not active in giving testimony. This was due to the fiery trouble of war of the nations. After nineteen hundred and nineteen the church began an active campaign of giving testimony, which shows a recovery from the conditions of uncleanness concerning which the Prophet Isaiah spoke, and his words foretold how it would come to pass. Isaiah (6:6,7) said: “Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The seraph in this text represents the Lord’s Messenger; and taking fire from the altar and putting it upon the mouth of the prophet foretells that the Lord would cleanse his people by touching their lips and sending them forth to give a testimony to his name. Fire is a symbol of that which cleanses; and the prophet says the iniquity and sin was taken away by fire. In the latter part of nineteen hundred and nineteen the Lord’s people awakened to the fact that they were inactive and that the Lord had something for them to do; and this is foretold in the prophecy, as Isaiah stated in the vision, to wit: “Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us [to be witnesses] ? Then said I, Here am I; send me.”—Isa. 6: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the prophet foretold a willingness on the part of God’s people to grasp the opportunity of giving the witness. The facts are that in nineteen hundred and nineteen, at a convention of Christians assembled in Cedar Point, Ohio, those who were there realized that the time had come to begin an active witness campaign, and that was done. The prophet shows that the giving of this witness would not convert the world, but that it is more particularly for the purpose of serving notice upon the people of and concerning God’s purposes. Therefore the Lord said to his people, as foretold by the prophet: “Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.”—Isa. 6: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then the prophet inquired: “How long” shall the witness be given? Thus he foretold that, after the Lord’s coming to his temple, the anointed people of Jehovah would begin the witness work and would inquire “how long” the giving of this testimony must continue. The Lord himself then gives the answer to the question, and causes the prophet to write: “Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.” —Isa. 6:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the words of the prophet God foretold that he would have the testimony to be given continuously “until the cities [that is, the organizations of the Devil] be wasted” by himself, and until the people be far removed from that evil organization. The witness has been in progress since then, and there has been a great falling away of the people from so-called “organized Christianity”, great numbers thereof recognizing that that organization does not represent Jehovah God, but is Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s anointed people, built up in Zion and brought into the spiritual temple of God, realize that Jehovah has been “angry” with them, according to Isaiah’s prophecy, because they were not diligent in keeping his commandments, and the Lord God brings them comfort; and this is proven by the words of the Prophet Isaiah, which read: “And in that day thou shalt say, 0 Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.”—Isa. 12:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Water is a symbol of God’s truth. The faithful ones, anointed of God, being obedient to God’s commandments, drink deep at the fountain of truth and rejoice. He gives to them a clearer vision of his Word and says to them: ‘ ‘ Therefore with joy shall ye draw water [that is to say, truth] out of the wells of salvation.” (Isa. 12:3) Those who are actively and joyfully engaged in keeping the Lord’s commandments by telling others of his great purposes, are permitted by him to have a clearer understanding of the truth. Drawing the water out of the wells means that they seek the truth by studying the prophecies of the Lord and watching the facts that come to pass in fulfilment thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again, in this prophecy “that day” is mentioned. “That day” is now here; and concerning this God caused his prophet to record his commandments to his people, which record applies to all those who truly love God and who delight to keep his commandments. The commandments of the Lord therefore are: “ And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth. Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee. ’ ’—Isa. 12:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophecies and the fulfilment thereof prove beyond any question of doubt that Christ Jesus is the great Witness for Jehovah God; that when he comes to his temple and takes account with his servants, to those whom he finds faithful he commits the privilege and obligation of giving the witness on earth from that time until the fall of Satan’s organization; that such witnesses are commanded to declare that Jehovah is the only true and Almighty God; and that all who are anointed of the Lord and have his approval constitute the company upon earth to give that testimony. It being the will of God that this testimony must be given at this time, it will be given regardless of all opposition. Blessed are they who have any part in thus testifying to the rulers and the people that Jehovah is God, and that the time has come for the establishment of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is difficult for many people to understand just why such a company of Christians persistently go about speaking of the Lord and his purposes. They can readily see that they are not attempting to convert the people and bring them into some organization. They can also see that they are not doing it for money. Why, then, is such work being done? What is being accomplished by it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God caused his prophet to foretell the reason why his witnesses must now give testimony before the peoples of the world that he is the Almighty God. The enemy and his agents would have the people believe that requiring the giving of testimony that Jehovah is God shows selfishness and weakness on God’s part: selfishness, because, say they, he desires the honor that the people would confer upon him by giving him praise; weakness, in this, that he fears that all creation will forsake him. Such conclusions are entirely wrong and are indeed wicked. God could not be selfish, because ‘ ‘ God is love ’ ’, which means that he is the perfect expression of unselfishness. He never did anything for a selfish reason, but always for the good of his creatures. His great unselfishness and perfect love were specifically shown when he gave his beloved Son to be put to death as a sacrifice that men might live. In this great act, the apostle truly says, Jehovah made a gift for mankind that cannot be fully valued; he exclaimed: “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.” (2 Cor. 9:15) This for ever disproves that there is selfishness on Jehovah’s part in having the witness given. No power could exist or be exercised except by the permission of Jehovah, because he is the Author and Creator of heaven and earth, and all power is in his hands. It is therefore impossible for God to fear that anything would be taken away from him. All the facts show that he acts for the vindication of his name and for the benefit of his creatures. For centuries Satan has attempted to prove to all others of creation that he is equal to Jehovah God; and for this reason he has attempted to duplicate and has counterfeited the principal parts of God’s purposes revealed to man. Satan, by reason of his fraud and misrepresentations, has succeeded in turning the masses of the people away from God. Jehovah has not interfered with Satan’s attempt to exalt himself ; but, unless he did interfere at some time, almost all men would be for ever destroyed. Satan has never been able to give life to man, and never could do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is the fountain of everlasting life. God alone can give everlasting life to his creatures. But he will not force life upon them. He provides life as a gracious gift, and then brings man to a knowledge of his purposes that man may have an opportunity to accept or not. Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.—Rom. 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No man could accept a gift without knowledge of the gift and the giver. Therefore if man is ever to receive life everlasting he must know God and know that he is the gracious Giver. The time comes for God to halt Satan in his nefarious course, in order that man, unhindered, may have an opportunity to receive the gift of life. God announces his purpose to destroy Satan and his wicked works, to the end that all willingly obedient ones may have life everlasting in a state of happiness. Before that time of destruction, however, God causes a campaign of education to be carried on in the world for the purpose of informing the people what he purposes to do for their good. He will not take action secretly and without giving notice. He will have the people told of his purpose, and then he will demonstrate to them his supreme power. The purpose of the witnessing, or the campaign of education, may therefore be briefly stated as this: To enlighten the people by opening their blind eyes, and to enable the religious prisoners to see that there is to be a relief for them, and that all may know the only one and true way to life everlasting in happiness. To do this it is necessary to tell the people what constitutes God’s organization and what constitutes Satan’s organization, and why the one is opposed to the other, and how God’s organization will, very soon now, destroy every particle of Satan’s organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE Scriptures leave no room for doubt as to who shall be the rightful Head of all earthly government, which government shall be set up in God’s own due time. The truths concerning that great government were written expressly for the benefit of those who search out the truth, that these might have their faith firmly established and have a sure foundation for the hope of a righteous government. (Rom. 15:4) To such God has furnished his Word as a lamp or light to guide the course of action taken by those who want to serve him.—Ps. 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly following the flood, Noah, by God’s direction, uttered a prophecy foretelling the blessing of his sons Shem and Japheth, particularly the blessings concerning Shem. The record of this is found in Genesis 9: 26, 27 and reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And he [Noah] said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Melchizedek is the first one mentioned in the Scriptures as a man who ruled any people by divine right. Undoubtedly he was of Shem’s line, and it is quite probable that Shem and Melchizedek were closely related. Shem was living at the time Abraham met Melchizedek and paid tithes to him. (Gen. 11:11) Abraham was a descendant of Shem. (Gen. 11:12-26) To Abraham God said: “I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.” (Gen. 17:6) Based upon these prophetic parts of the Record it is certain that he who should receive the right to rule would descend from the line of Shem and through Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jacob was a grandson of Abraham. God changed Jacob’s name to that of Israel. Then God caused this prophecy to be written: “There shall come a Star</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE HIGHEST</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel. . . . Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.” (Num. 24:17,19) Jesus said of himself: “I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. ’ ’—Rev. 22:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judah was a son of Jacob, concerning whom a special prophecy was written: “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.” (Gen. 49:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font4"> V.) The descent of the rightful ruler of earth therefore must be through the line of Judah. The name Judah means praise. (Gen. 29:35) “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise. ’ ’ (Gen. 49:8) The Mighty One whom Judah foreshadowed is called “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”. (Rev. 5:5) This shows that the Mighty One foretold would praise Jehovah God and he in turn would be praised for his faithfulness and loyalty to God and his praise should arise from all creation in God’s due time.—Phil. 2:5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the death of Joshua leadership was given to Judah. (Judg. 1:1,2) “For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph’s. (1 Chron. 5:2) In Psalm 60, verse 7, it is written, “Judah is my sceptre [symbol of authority].” Caleb was of the tribe of Judah; and at the division of the land in Palestine Caleb received as his inheritance the mountain of Hebron. (Josh. 14:12-14) “Mountain” is a symbol of a government or kingdom. In that division of the land the tribe of Judah as a whole received a tract of land which bordered on Mount Seir, the latter being a symbol of the Devil’s organization of earth. (Josh. 15:8-10) This would indicate that the Devil’s organization would extend up to the beginning of the government of Jehovah ruled by him whose right it is to rule, which ruler should descend through the line of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesse was of the tribe of Judah. It was Jesse’s son David whom Jehovah anointed as king over Israel. (1 Sam. 16:13,14) To David the Lord said: “And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for evermore.” (1 Chron. 17:11,14) To Solomon the son of David, God said: “And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.” (1 Ki. 9:4,5) That both David and Solomon foreshadowed the real Ruler is made clear by the words of the prophecy recorded in Isaiah 9, verse seven:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Isaiah 16, verse five, we read that “in mercy shall the throne be established; and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That David foreshadowed the rightful Ruler and his coming righteous government is just as certain as day and night.—Jer. 33: 20, 21, 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year 606 B.C., with the overthrow of Zede-kiah the last king of Israel, there was a breach made in the line of rulers over Israel, God's chosen people. Through his prophet God foretold a day coming when he would close up this breach and bring into power earth’s rightful Governor and that that Ruler would be of the line of David. ‘ ‘ In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof: and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old.”—Amos 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mount Zion is a symbol of God’s organization, of which organization earth’s rightful Governor must be the Head. In line with the foregoing prophecies it is written: “Moreover, he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim; but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion, which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.”—Ps. 78:67-70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bethlehem was small among the families of Judah, but God chose it as the place of the birth of the rightful Ruler of earth and foretold that through his prophet: “But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.” (Mic. 5:2) Bethlehem was the home of Jesse and the home of David, who was anointed by Jehovah as the king over Israel; and Bethlehem is often called the city of David.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mary, the virgin of the house of David, conceived a son by the power of the holy spirit of God. (Luke 1:27-29) God sent his angel from heaven to inform Mary that she should be the mother of the promised One whom the prophets of God had foretold: “And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. ’ ’—Luke 1: 30-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures therefore trace the lineage of Jesus in an unbroken line from Shem, from Abraham, from Jacob, and from the tribe of Judah, and through David, God’s anointed king over his people. In due time the son of Mary, who God announced through his angel should be called Jesus, was born at Bethlehem as foretold. On that memorable occasion the holy angels of heaven bore testimony to his identity. The special messenger whom God delegated to give witness said: “And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”—Luke 2: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Apostle Peter, moved by the power of the holy spirit, testified that Jesus Christ is the One whom God foretold as him “whose right it is” to be the ruler of earth. That interesting record is found in Acts 2, verses twenty-nine to thirty-one, which reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE people on the west coast of Africa have long been kept in darkness. The Lord has been gracious to them, however, and sent them the light, and even some of the clergy are breaking away from the prisons and taking a firm stand for the Lord. The following letter from a former clergyman, and his letter to the Bishopscourt at Lagos, bear upon this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am sure you will be pleased to know that a leader in the Devil’s army has received grace, and heard the call to get out of Babylon, where for many years I was a devoted worker. The enclosed copy of my letter to the bishop of Lagos speaks for itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Having consecrated myself unto the Lord it is my earnest desire to be a fellow worker with the Lord’s servants remaining on earth in giving the witness of the incoming kingdom which will be established world-wide soon after He shall have destroyed Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not possible for me to express my debt of gratitude to the Lord God for the blessings I have received and am still receiving from the “meat in due season’’ that has been coming out from Brooklyn through you and your faithful fellow workers. By God’s grace I am determined to use the blessings to the glory of the Giver.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The Right Rev. The Bishop of Lagos, D.D.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bishopscourt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Right Rev. and dear Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In obedience to the Lord God and His beloved Son Jesus Christ and in fairness to my conscience I am willingly giving you notice of my resignation of the Anglican ministry and separation from the organized church for reasons herein stated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1. I can no longer subscribe to the book of Common Prayer and 39 Articles as being Scriptural: because in them doctrines of Trinity, hell-fire torment, immortality of soul, with their ramifications, are taught, which do dishonor to Jehovah God and hide from men His wisdom, love, justice and power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">2. The Church of England is in confusion or Babylon. Each man may teach anything but the pure Word of God, as the bishop of Birmingham and others who hold and teach the evolution theory that sets at nought the atoning death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and still remain in the communion. The Anglo-catholics also are allowed. Hardly five bishops have the same views, yet all belong to the same church. I cannot reconcile this state with the Word of God, which is indivisible Truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">3. The organized church of England is in spiritual harlotry or whoredom, for she has married herself to the worldly powers that are her protectors and friends: hence there is no persecution for her as it was for Christ Jesus and the early Christians.—John 15:18-20; Jas. 4:4; 1 John 3:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">As for the rites of the church, Infant Baptism cannot be true and I can no longer perform it. Adult Baptism I do not believe is properly done except by immersion. The Holy Communion as the Lord’s memorial should not be more than once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am therefore willingly surrendering my license herewith, and but for the three months’ leave in which I am I have nothing more to do with the Church of England and the Diocese of Lagos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I know this will cause you grief, but you know it is better to obey God rather than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours faithfully,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH LAVISHES HIS GIFTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in Jehovah’s name and service. For many months we have thought to write you to say so many things, but feared to indulge your time. Our pioneer party, consisting of Brother and Sister Potter, and Sister Oathout and myself, attended the Columbus convention. It was better than ever we could anticipate. There were so many things that we would like to thank you for personally for having been used of the Lord to provide us with. Permit me to enumerate only a few:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First, the place, the Ohio State Fair Grounds. It seems that Jehovah lavishes his gifts on his people. Everything needed, and more, was there. Then the ever delightful program that moved forward with a majestic step that fairly inspired eon fidence in Jehovah and all his other arrangements. Then the culmination of many weeks of “surprise features’’. Does Jehovah indulge his children? Words can’t express the ecstatic thrills of joy in the Lord that we experienced as one after another we received our new name, “Jehovah’s witnesses,’’ the announcement and gifts of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet also, with opportunity and privilege to take it out to the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has all passed so quickly that we nearly regret its passing so rapidly; but we are mindful that our Father has not yet assembled his loved ones together to partake of “pleasures for evermore ’ ’. So we are back again to our •<sup>1</sup> interests ’ ’, telling the people of establishment on the earth of God's kingdom. Some hear, and some don’t; but whether they do or do not. we know the pioneer service is the greatest, grandest and most inportant work there is on the earth today. We do not wonder you esteem it so highly and regard it with so much care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only with Jehovah’s blessing could you “carry on’’ thus against the pressure of Satan’s agents both seen and unseen and it is our prayer daily that you may be used of the Lord as you seek always to do his will. Keep up the fight! We are with you till the last demon drops dead in the dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We nearly omitted stating that our eleven-year-old daughter Charlotte symbolized her consecration at Columbus and goes out with us in the pioneer service. Many people have expressed themselves so pleased with the child’s presentation of the truth that they have themselves become interested in the truth. What is it that is said that “a little child shall lead them ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren by Jehovah’s grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Oathout &amp;&nbsp;Potter Pioneer Party, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">S. Dai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS GLOW WITH JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am herewith making a sort of general report of condition existing in companies as I have observed them during the last year or more, during which I have served at about fifty weekend three-day conventions. My observations are that these conventions are a great blessing and help to the friends. In nearly every instance the attendance was greater than was expected by the local company; more persons participated in the service than was expected, and the number of pieces of literature placed was much greater than expected. In every case the friends were surprised and happy and were unanimous in there desire for the conventions to be continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These conventions benefit the friends, by encoui aging and stimulating them to engage in the service work. Of late we have asked for a show of hands as to how many engaged in the service for the first time and were surprised to find that tron one to a dozen hands went up. It seems that some who are timid find it easier to begin the service work in other than their own towns. The enthusiasm and numbers who go out in the work seem to stimulate them to desire to have a part. Once the ice is broken they find it easy to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another very noticeable condition is the increasing fearless ness of the friends. It has been inspiring to note the desire of all to have a part in witnessing to the rulers. One company proposed to select a particular brother to visit the politicians, another to call on the preachers, and another to call on the finan ciers, attempting to make the selection according to some seemingly particular qualification for approaching these classes This resulted in a protest by others, each one desiring to have a part. The results showed that even the<sup>1</sup> ‘ weakest and feeblest ’ ’ have the Lord’s blessing in this work equally with the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a delightful privilege to lead a ‘ ‘ declarations ’ ’ meeting on Sunday afternoon, after the witnessing is completed, and eee the happy faces and hear the joyful declarations. No more do we hear about the great battle with “the man under our own hat’’, nor the old long-faced tearful “testimony’’ about the great trials in the home with relatives not in the truth. The declarations are along the line of gratitude to the Lord for the privileges of knowing of the work which Jehovah is doing, and of serving him and vindicating his name, and also expressions of determination to continue on till the work is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The dissatisfied, fault-finding, grumbling element is gone, and the conventions glow with joy and the spirit of willing cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In some half dozen instances, the regional director tried out this experiment, and it seems to work successfully. Perhaps you may have some comment to make on this work. After the Saturday afternoon lecture, which ended at five o'clock, all the workers, previously supplied with books arid territory, went out on the street corners, four standing at each intersection, one on each corner, and displayed the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet, calling attention to the same. They were instructed not to obstruct the sidewalk, and not to stop people who were busily engaged in conversation, or hurriedly passing, but to approach those who were standing or leisurely walking. At Atlanta, Ga., over 1.000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklets were placed, and in the half dozen instances mentioned the placements have averaged about ten for each individual for the one hour between five and six o’clock. Saturday afternoon is particularly adapted to this work, especially in the smaller cities, as most of the farmers are in town at that time. This method of service is recommended for anyone who can spare only an hour or even half an hour, or any odd times during the noon hour, or during the long summer evenings after the day’s work is over. Moreover, this service places the books in the hands of men, who are more apt to read them than are the women. I would like to know your opinion of this kind of service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These service conventions serve another good purpose also, and that is, that the friends are kept so busy that they do not have time for gossip or tattling, and their minds are kept so completely on the work of the convention that the friends are happier, more contented and more enthusiastic, while their minds are free from the depressing influence of gloomy and morbid suggestions incident to a discussion of troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year, I have visited only about four </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">companies </span><span class="font3">where trouble existed. These troubles are not doctrinal, but frictions between individuals, and both factions in harmony with the work of the Society. I mention this fact only to show that the “opposers” are practically all separated from the various companies. There is little or no opposition now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another noticeable fact is that the friends are gradually learning to be more tactful in giving their witness. In the past, many have thought it necessary to be somewhat harsh and unkind, especially where a person was opposed or discourteous. The friends are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">learning how</span><span class="font3"> to give a helpful witness. Many quite laughable incidents have occurred, which I will not relate here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I think it fair to call your attention to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> criticism of these service conventions. Some of the companies think it unwise to leave their own territory and attend a convention and witness in other territory, where their service is not needed so much as in their home territory., In one case, this kept a few companies from attending a nearby convention, and quite materially lessened the report of placements and testimonies as well as the report of attendance. Personally, I believe the influence of the convention spirit will offset this seeming disadvantage, and it might be completely offset by locating the next convention at one of the other cities, thus properly distributing the witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With respect to myself, I can say that it has been a great joy to serve at these conventions, and to participate in the field service, thus having a part in the work of vindicating Jehovah’s glorious name. I daily thank Jehovah God for this privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With much Christian love, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">R. H. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Barber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WONDERFULLY BLESSED IN SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My beloved Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Love and greetings to you and all that be in C----, in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">real up-to-date present truth and faith. I am laid up at my home as above on account of an accident (fall) seven weeks ago tomorrow a.m. at 6: 30. Myself and partner in the pioneer work (in this case Brother Ruelberg) were working rural here at the time, and Jehovah permitted that old Dragon, Serpent, Devil and Satan, to throw me down and injure me real badly. It may be for weeks yet. I am glad to say, however, that I had a good accidental policy in force at the time which pays me a real good salary payable one-half due me cash each sixty days, and shall not be in need of any necessities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have been in the pioneer work almost two years, and have just been able to make ends meet with my own expenses, and only able to do very little for my good old Episcopalian blinded wife, and was away from home the last time nearly one year. I didn’t have the price to go in, and would send everything in home that I could possibly get, and spent nothing on trips there and forth. It looked as if I would just have to abandon the work; but I stuck to it. I knew that if I would remain faithful, he would not forsake me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For about ten days after my accident I did not get out of bed, and as yet I have never had on a pair of pants or been out of the house. But, dear brother, I did not forget I was one of the anointed, and for the love of it bearing the fruits of the kingdom to all who would partake. So I soon saw what Jehovah’s will for me was: To write letters to all my neighbors and friends, both great and small, and all the clergy of all denominations, asking them to call at my house, as I had matters to consider in mutual interest with them, and I could not call on them now as I would do. They took the guardian angel’s bait finely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have been visited by twelve clergy and religious workers to date, including a captain of the Salvation Army and the secretary of the Y.M.C.A. here. All my neighbors of both sides of the two streets (we live on a corner) as far as I can see the four ways have called. Some of these I have never been in their homes or they in mine before. I have had them calling from one to ten daily; only one yesterday, and two today to this hour, 4: 13 p.m., but look for them from 8: 30 a.m. to 8: 30 p.m. The good news is that my placements have been just 100 percent. Have not failed to deliver to every caller the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font3"> booklet; and only five to date but had the cash and willingly parted with it. Many others took books and other booklets. Last week I reported 17 testimonies, 17 placements, being 35 booklets and 11 bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I loaned an old church-goer friend about ten days ago </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> One. He read it and appreciated it, came again today, did not bring it back, but said he wanted to keep it and bought No. 2 to go with it, and said he was going to get from two to four until he owned the full set. I have two full sets ordered for this week’s delivery, and I am almost sure I will be able to deliver them. I have been so wonderfully blessed in His service since my affliction; and I cannot express to you my great happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have about forty names yet to write to. I write from four to six daily. I am getting out with the letters today four letters to the clergy. The good part is, dear friends, I have not had a single argument with a clergyman or anyone in this work at my home yet. Now is not this a good record! I want you all to remember me in your prayers, that I may ever seek Jehovah’s will and do it in a way pleasing to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At a recent meeting of our company it was decided by unanimous vote to accept the new name, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” and to notify you of our action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us also thank you for your untiring service on our behalf and for the great privilege of cooperating with you in the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours in kingdom service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tonawanda</span><span class="font3"> (N.Y.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GREATEST WORK IN ALL AGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in the name of our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have hesitated to take your time; but I do want you to know of my gratitude to my dear heavenly Father and you, not only for the texts that are brought to out attention day after day, but for the wonderful books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> and now </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font3"> It is marvelous m our eyes. &quot;It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am so glad I can bear the fruits of the kingdom to the people, knowing they will bring joy and gladness to the honest-hearted ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am so glad to be your fellow servant in the greatest work in all the ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We realize the danger of the remnant at this time, and are so grateful for the watchman the Lord has set in his tower </span><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font3">warn and guide us little ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We know that obedience is better than sacrifice. The obedient angels are having a wonderful part at this time, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your courage, born of the spirit, and fearlessness is a great inspiration to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the dear Lord continue to bless and use you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am, as ever, one of Jehovah’s witnesses,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PRIVILEGE EQUAL TO NONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Beloved Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With my heart full of gratitude to our heavenly Father, and in appreciation of the spiritual food he is sending us through you, I am sending you hearty greetings in behalf of the newly created small company of Jehovah’s witnesses of Sioux Falls, including myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Assembled as usual for study last Sunday, we four of </span><span class="font2">same </span><span class="font3">precious faith, being examined as to whether we are to </span><span class="font2">be a </span><span class="font3">part of that servant class or not, found that by the Lord’s grace we are all four in complete harmony with the Society, and joyfully recognize the fact that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is being used by the Lord to feed with </span><span class="font2">‘‘meat in </span><span class="font3">due season” those whom he called to show forth his </span><span class="font2">praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore being fully convinced that to be a witness for the great Jehovah is a privilege equal to none, and knowing that unity of action brings more blessings, we organized as a small company of Jehovah’s witnesses, hoping that we may by his grace avail ourselves of every opportunity in singing the new song of his kingdom and having thus a small part in the vindication of his holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the dear Lord continue to use you and bless your efforts for the glory of his name, is the earnest prayer of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren by his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THANK JEHOVAH FOR THE PRIVILEGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I know you are very busy and your time is all taken up in the service of our great King; but I can’t refrain longer from expressing my thanks to you for the marvelous light the dear Lord has revealed concerning himself and his great cause, through you. Be assured, dear brother, of my prayers and loyal support to the end of the way. It was through your loving zeal and boldness in proclaiming the message of the hour that I was aroused from a stupor and brought to see the marvelous doings of the Lord at the present time. As soon as the Lord revealed the great red dragon and his organization to me I promptly came out, and accepted Jehovah God and his great organization, and thank him sincerely for the privilege of entering upon the great highway with the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Continue, dear brother, to press forward with boldness in the service of our great God and King, with the assurance that our heavenly Father’s divine protection will be over you at all times. Be assured also of the continued support and cooperation of the remnant to the complete victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yours in the service of our King,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font3">lone witness of Jehovah,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“WOULD NOT CHANGE PLACES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After reading the November 1 (1931) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> article, &quot;Taught of God,” I must tell you that it was in 1925 when Sister Ross and I first began to discern the truth. I had only six grades of school, and many of the &quot;smart” speaking elders at that time had laid the &quot;Birth of the Nation” article on the shelf, and from the platform were advising others to do likewise. Thank God! even though it looked impossible for me to understand it, in the face of all that was said, I reasoned that if God’s table was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> he would not put food on it that could not be digested. So I wore one &quot;Birth of the Nation” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> out and sent to the Society for another; and I thank God I was rewarded with a clearer vision, and since that time I have had no trouble in getting a clear understanding of all the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font3"> in two or three readings. Some of the stronger &quot;meat” I often reread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the call for pioneers came, the same elders cited me 1 Timothy 5: 8, without the context, and told me that my duty was to my wife and my baby, then an infant. Then along came -------, a service director, and said: ‘ ‘ By all means</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">go if you can.” I wrote you, and you cited me Proverbs 3:5,6. Now my little girl is the years old, and has never wanted for anything she needed; and Sister Ross is also a pioneer. And I would not change places with any of the &quot;smart ones” that have not understood Proverbs 3: 7 for all the Devil’s complete organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am more than thankful unto obedience to the organization that has been taught of Jehovah, through Christ the first of the birth. It is very evident now to all the children of the &quot;woman” (God’s organization) that no man unless guided by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font3"> of God </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">could</span><span class="font3"> have brought forth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font3">1 and 2, the light on Esther, the clear understanding of Ezekiel’s prophecy in the first twenty-four chaptets, the highway and the narrow way, and that great book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font3"> that shows the grim reality of the Devil's organization, and all the rest. I thank God” for all of them, with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> and wish to convey to you as a servant of the Lord our love; and we will cooperate with you to &quot;go through the midst of Jerusalem”, by the grace of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please excuse me for encroaching on your time. I will not infringe again soon. I just could not keep from writing you after reading this wonderful article. And my prayer is that it will help those with feeble knees to bung off the shelf those dust-covered love letters from Jehovah, and to never let dust settle on them again until they have digested their meat. May God continue to bless and keep you at the front, dear Brother Rutherford. I am, with warmest love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">L. C. Ross, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DETERMINATION TO STAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rltheuford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Happy greetings in our Redeemer’s name. We are very much pleased to send you this note bearing information of the blessings we received from a one-day service convention held by our company at Rio Hondo. Beginning at nine-thirty our topic was the resolution adopted at Columbus re our &quot;new name”. A sweet glow of confidence and repose was seen on every face. When we separated for the field work, Jehovah’s witnesses stuck the message at every home. Owing to the hard conditions here we could not do much by way of putting out the literature, the people being very poor; but there was exceedingly great reception of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our evening public lecture on ‘ ‘ Daniel's Image ’ ’ was well attended. Satan, and his organization, was clearly unveiled, and the necessity of Jehovah’s kingdom, man’s only hope, was clearly shown. The brethren of our company unanimously cast their hands heavenward to the new name. &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses,” being a hundred percent refreshed, determined to walk on the highway of holiness. We convey to you our love, and allegiance to our heavenly Father, and our profound determination to stand by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, sending up daily our individual and collective prayers for you and staff. May Jehovah continue to bless and keep you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With much Christian love, we remain,</span></p>
