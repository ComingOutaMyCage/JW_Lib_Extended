<p><span class="font11">1932 Year Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE purpose of the YEAR BOOK is to keep a record of the work on earth relating to the kingdom of God, and to advise those who love God of the progress of that work. Everything with Jehovah God is orderly, and his affairs work systematically and orderly in harmony with his will. Jehovah is not a God of confusion, but the God of order, and it is his will that all his obedient creatures deport themselves orderly. The YEAR BOOK is therefore an appropriate thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures reveal that Jehovah has a great and universal organization and out from this he is taking and setting into operation the kingdom of Messiah, which is made the chief part or capital of his organization. Those on the earth who are wholly and entirely devoted to God and his kingdom and who have received his anointing constitute a part of his organization and the representatives of the Lord on the earth. God has set the members in the body of Christ as it pleases him, and we may be sure that he has set the members in the earthly part of his organization according to his own good pleasure. His people on the earth are instructed to have an organization with leaders or teachers, and these, he instructs, are to be elected by vote of the company forming his consecrated people. In 1917 a general vote of those claiming to be consecrated to Jehovah God was taken, and certain officers were elected, upon whom was conferred the authority and duty to perform</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">certain service in connection with the Lord’s organization. These officers continue by the grace of God to carry on the work assigned to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year of the Society of God’s consecrated people is from November 1 to October 31 the following year. At the end of each fiscal year the president of the Society makes a report, and this report forms a part of this YEAR BOOK. There are organizations or bodies of God’s anointed people in many countries of the earth, all working together and in harmony to carry forward the work of the kingdom of the Lord. In each of these countries there is a local manager who makes report to the president of the Society, and he examines each one of these reports and incorporates the more important parts thereof into his general report which appears in the YEAR BOOK. It will be found in this report that there are 40 branch offices in addition to the main office which is maintained at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s anointed people appreciate the necessity of daily feeding their minds upon the food convenient for them and which the Lord has provided for them. The YEAR BOOK, therefore, contains a Scripture text selected for the year, and an appropriate text for each day of the year. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> a journal published twice each month, and books commenting upon the Scriptures and published for the aid and instruction of those who love God, are used in connection with these daily texts. Comments appropriate to the texts selected are taken from these publications, and such comments immediately follow the text for the day. The YEAR BOOK will be found profitable and a comfort to all who love and serve God with a pure heart.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>PRESIDENT’S REPORT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the fiscal year of 1931 it is my privilege and pleasure to make report to you of and concerning the activities of the kingdom work done during that year. Every one of the anointed has the keenest interest in the progress of the kingdom work. Majestically the Lord is marching forward, and it is thrilling to observe the manner in which Jehovah is causing his prophecies to be fulfilled, and which he caused to be written centuries ago. I am confident that each one of you will read this report with gladness of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah the only true and the almighty God is now setting up his kingdom that will rule all the world. For centuries men who have been devoted to God have been looking for this time. The great work is progressing. John the Baptist was the last of the company of prophets taken from amongst men. Prior to his day the holy prophets of God, moved by the spirit of Jehovah, prophesied concerning the coming of God’s kingdom by and through which kingdom all the families of the earth shall be blessed. To John the Immerser was granted the great privilege of announcing the presence of Christ Jesus, the long-looked-for king. Jesus was a man when he came to the Jordan to outwardly acknowledge his covenant made to do the will of God his Father. He was there brought forth by Jehovah and publicly acknowledged as his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased. Shortly thereafter Jesus was anointed by Jehovah to be the King of the world. From that time forward he has been and is The Messiah, the anointed King. Before beginning his reign as King, however, he must according to the will of God provide the redemptive price for man. Therefore, when Jesus entered his public work, John made this announcement: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” The Savior of man then stood upon the earth, and he was also the anointed King whom Jehovah had appointed and anointed to rule the world in righteousness, and to bring complete vindication to the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before the coming of the Prophet John the Im-merser, the law of God and the prophecies of God were preached to those who would hear, and both the law and the prophets testified to the coming of God’s kingdom. After the coming of John the Immerser the kingdom was announced and preached, because the King was then present. In Luke 16:16 it is written: ‘ ‘ The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached.” In Matthew 11:13 it is written, “For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.” The law and the testimony of the prophets were true, and now Jesus had come to fulfil all the law and all the prophecies concerning the kingdom. The privilege granted to John the Immerser to announce the King manifestly made him the greatest of all the prophets. (Matt. 11:11) That great privilege, however, is not so great as that which is conferred upon the remnant which now compose “Jehovah’s witnesses” in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the day of Pentecost forward the kingdom of God was preached by those who loved Jehovah. Jesus had repeatedly instructed his disciples concerning the kingdom, but they did not understand and appreciate his meaning until they had received the holy spirit at Pentecost. Then it was that Peter, the apostle to whom Jesus had delivered the keys or privilege of unlocking the truth of and concerning the kingdom to the Jews and later to the Gentiles, stood up and testified to those within his hearing, telling them of God’s purpose to establish his kingdom under Christ and through which all nations of the earth would have an opportunity to receive his blessing. Standing before that company Peter, under inspiration of the holy spirit, among other things said: “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy [spirit], he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.’’ (Acts 2:29-36) Thereafter the faithful followers of Christ Jesus preached Christ and him crucified as the Savior of the world, and Christ the great King and his kingdom as the ruler and blesser of the world. They continued to preach the coming of that great kingdom. (Acts 28:31) This was and has been in exact harmony with the prayer which Jesus taught his followers to pray, to wit: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is [done] in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only did Jesus emphasize the fact of the establishment of the kingdom of God, but his positive promise was that he would in due time return from heaven and, as the chief officer and head of Jehovah’s organization, he would set up that kingdom, and that then he would receive unto himself those really devoted to God and to Christ. Relying upon that and other like precious promises, the apostles faithfully preached the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom, and this they did until the end of their earthly careers. His coming and his kingdom was the greatest desire of their hearts. This is evidenced by some of their sayings recorded in the Scriptures. To Timothy Paul wrote: “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and doctrine.” (2 Tim. 4:1,2) Paul knew that his earthly career was about to close, and therefore he wrote to Timothy, saying: “But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.” (2 Tim. 4: 5-8) For the encouragement of others of like precious faith James wrote these words: “Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.” (Jas. 5:7) Those who have loved the coming of Christ and his kingdom have continued to preach the truth amidst great opposition, conscious at all times that they were right, and rejoicing in the privilege of being permitted to bear the reproaches that Satan heaps upon all who truly follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was exalted to heaven he was then the King, but Jehovah said to him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. ’ ’ (Ps. 110:1) God directed the writing of the prophecies of the prophets which appeared in the Scriptures, and from this source the apostles knew that Jesus must wait for the Father’s due time to come for his return and for his setting up of his kingdom; and this is proven by the words of Hebrews 10:12,13: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.” Jesus fully understood that he had been commissioned by Jehovah to destroy the enemy Satan and his organization, but this he could not do until God’s due time. Therefore he must wait. This period of waiting must end sometime. The period of waiting for the coming of the King to take his power and begin his reign has been a time of great expectation on the part of those devoted to Jehovah God. Repeatedly they have called one another’s attention to the great prophecy of Jesus himself concerning what would be the outward or visible proof to human eyes of his coming and his kingdom. The faithful ones, studying carefully the prophecies and the chronology of the Bible, saw that the year 1914 was a marked year, indicating that at that time some great event in connection with the kingdom would come to pass. When, in the autumn season of that year, the nations and the kingdoms of that part of the world called “Christendom” arose against each other in a great war, the faithful ones at once saw the outward or tangible proof that Christ, according to his promise and his prophecy, had assumed his great office and power as King. (Matt. 24: 7, 8) It was in that year, 1914, that Jehovah’s prophetic words were fulfilled, to wit: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6) God’s prophet then makes record of the words of the great Messiah himself, who spoke, saying: “I will [declare] the decree [previously made known to Jesus] ; Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I [brought thee forth]. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”—Ps. 2:7,8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to that time Jehovah had not interfered with Satan’s appearing in heaven, but now the time had come when Satan must get out of heaven. The righteous King was in authority, and Jehovah then said to his mighty officer: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) The rule of Christ Jesus began, and immediately there was a war in heaven which Christ Jesus the righteous King and his angels on one side fought against Satan the wicked one and his angels on the other side, and in that battle Satan was defeated and for ever cast out of heaven and down to the earth, even as Jesus had foretold would come to pass. (Rev. 12: 7-10) There was war progressing on earth, and war in heaven, and it was the beginning of the time of sorrows upon the world, and the time of rejoicing by those who loved the second coming of the Lord and his kingdom. It also marked the time of increased sorrow upon the inhabitants of the earth, because Satan since then has desperately attempted to turn all persons away from Jehovah God and gather them together under his command preparatory for the great battle of God Almighty, or Armageddon. It is therefore written; “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”— Bev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Scriptures the time of judgment of Christ the great Judge must begin three and one-half years from and after the time of his taking his royal power. Jesus had prophesied his appearance, in Matthew 25:31, that he would come for judgment and be accompanied by his holy angels, and that he would appear at the temple of Jehovah for judgment. This judgment other scriptures show must begin at the house of God, or with those who have made a covenant to do the will of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) By the testimony of Jesus these consecrated ones were to be and were divided into two companies. One company or part of those in the covenant did not meet the divine requirements and were cast aside by the Lord and designated the “evil servant”, while another part or company of the consecrated were found faithful and were approved by the judgment of the Lord, and by him made a part of the faithful and true “servant” of Jehovah God. The promise of Jesus was that to this faithful company he would commit all of his kingdom interests on the earth, and that this company must keep the commandment of God and deliver the testimony committed to them.—Matt. 24:45-47; Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>THE COMMANDMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What news could be so good and bring so much joy to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus as the news that the King had come and had begun his reign? For six thousand years faithful men had waited for that time, and now it has come. “Gospel” means good news. Therefore the commandment specifically given to the faithful “servant” of the Lord applies from and after the year 1918, when he came to his temple; and from that time to this present day these faithful ones have heard and obeyed the command, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) Every one who truly loves God proves that love by joyfully keeping his commandments. And since this commandment is given by the chief officer of Jehovah, it is God’s commandment. Every one of the faithful, therefore, must have a part in the preaching of the good news or gospel that the King has come and that his reign has begun. There is a specific reason why this message must be preached to the people. According to the words of Jesus it is being done as a witness to the nations, but not for the purpose or expectation of converting all the nations now. Jesus then adds, that, when this work of bearing testimony to the people is done, then there shall immediately follow the greatest trouble that has ever been or ever will be again upon the world. That great trouble is Armageddon, which will completely wreck Satan and Satan’s entire organization.—Matt. 24:21,22.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">• The kingdom that henceforth shall rule the world is Jehovah God’s kingdom, because God is the Author thereof; and it will vindicate his name and prove Jehovah to be the only true and almighty God. It is also called “the kingdom of heaven’’, because the seat of government is in heaven. It is also called “the kingdom of Christ”, because Christ Jesus is the great and mighty Ruler or King who demonstrates the judgment and decrees of Jehovah God and carries out his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great question at issue since the days of Eden has been and is, Who is the Supreme One and whose will shall be done amongst men? Satan the wicked one voluntarily assumed that high position in defiance of Jehovah God. He challenged Jehovah God, declaring that God could not put men on earth who would be faithful and true to him under great stress. That the name of Jehovah God might be for ever vindicated Jehovah first gave Satan the full opportunity to prove his contention, and then he declares that his purpose is to destroy Satan and his organization and thus convince all creation that Jehovah is the Almighty, the Supreme One. During the period of the Christian era Satan has obtained control of the organization called “organized Christianity”, and the teachers and the leaders therein Satan has induced to deny the Bible testimony concerning the creation of man as perfect, the fall of man by reason of sin, the redemption of man by the blood of Christ Jesus, and the kingdom of God as the one and only hope for the uplift and blessing of the nations and peoples of the world. Jehovah declares his purpose to bring the whole matter to a final and conclusive issue. He therefore says by his prophet: “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled; who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.” (Isa. 43: 9) Satan and his representatives in the nations are now challenged to bring forth their witnesses and prove their contention, or else admit that Satan is the great liar and that God’s word alone is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who will speak in the name of Jehovah God and faithfully bear testimony in his name? That Jehovah will have witnesses who do speak in his name there cannot be the least doubt, because he says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God. ’ ’ This scripture is fully supported by the prophecy uttered by Jesus concerning the testimony that must be given as a witness to the nations, and which must be given by his faithful followers who were made a part of the temple class; and therefore Jesus identifies these his faithful followers and the one whom he calls his “faithful and wise servant” as the ones who shall bear this testimony to the name of Jehovah God. As Jesus declares that the completion of this testimony shall be followed by the great time of trouble known as Armageddon, even so the same prophet of Jehovah says: “Thus saith [Jehovah], your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel [God’s chosen people] : For your sake I have sent to Babylon [Satan’s organization], and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans [Satan’s representatives], whose cry is in the ships. I am the Lord, your Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One, the creator of Israel [God’s chosen people], your King. Thus saith the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; They [those composing Satan’s organization] shall lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.” (Isa. 43: 14-17) Thus the Lord shows that he will completely clean out the Devil’s crowd when the testimony by Jehovah’s witnesses has been completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the great Servant of Jehovah God, and the faithful followers of Christ upon the earth at his coming and his kingdom constitute what the Scriptures call ‘the feet of him that brings good tidings and publishes peace’. (Isa. 52:7) These faithful ones are upon the mount of God, Mount Zion, because they have been gathered into God’s organization and made a part thereof, and these are following the leadership of Christ Jesus the King. (Rev. 14:1, 2) Jehovah God has constituted Christ Jesus and his body members as his instrument for the opening of the blind eyes of the people, that the prisoners in Satan’s organization might be released, and that others of good will might get their eyes open. (Isa. 42: 6,7) “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” —Isa. 55:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Acting by and through his beloved Son and Chief Executive Officer, Jehovah God has risen up to make an end of lawlessness, but before dashing to pieces the wicked one and his organization he sends forth his witnesses to give warning to Satan’s representatives in Christendom. (Ezek. 3:5-11) For the comfort and encouragement of those who now have boldness to serve God and to speak forth his name in this day of judgment, Jehovah says: “For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth. And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.” —Isa. 62:1,2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heretofore God’s faithful people have been known by divers names, but the time has come when the mouth of Jehovah gives to his people a “new name”, that there can be no misunderstanding as to whom they represent. To his faithful witnesses who keep his commandments and bear the testimony of Jesus Christ, Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” Therefore the name bestowed upon his faithful ones is “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Often Jehovah has used his devoted people to fulfil certain portions of his prophecies, and then later revealed to them that they have been so used. It was in 1918 that the Lord Jesus began judgment at the temple of God. From that time forward the approved ones were brought into the temple and made the witnesses of Jehovah. It was at that time that the new name was given by Jehovah to his anointed ones, and all those who have been brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness received that name, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” It was not until 1931, however, that Jehovah God made known to his people that he had thus named them. When they were enlightened, a company of his faithful people, assembled at Columbus, Ohio, adopted the following resolution, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Whereas, about 1874, in fulfilment of divine prophecy, the Lord Jesus Christ began the work of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘preparing the way before Jehovah’ and to restore to his faithful followers on earth a clearer understanding of the fundamental truths taught by Jesus and his apostles and which for centuries had been made obscure by others ’ teaching false doctrines; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Whereas from and after that date, for a period of more than forty years, Charles T. Russell, a faithful follower of Christ Jesus and a servant of Jehovah God, led a company of his brethren in Christ in the preaching and teaching of the divine Word, and particularly with reference to the second coming of Christ, the setting up of his kingdom, and the restoration of man to perfection on the earth; and to carry on said work orderly said company of Christians organized the corporations known as the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the International Bible Students Association, and the Peoples Pulpit Association, and they used and now use these corporations for the publication of books, magazines and other Bible literature; and in the course of time said company of Christians became known by such names as, to wit, ‘Russellites,’ ‘Millennial Dawn People,’ ‘International Bible Students Association,’ and other like names; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Whereas shortly following the death of Charles T. Russell a division arose between those associated with him in such work, resulting in a number of such withdrawing from the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and who have since refused to cooperate with said Society and its work and who decline to concur in the truth as published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and the other recent publications of the above-named corporations, and have opposed and do now oppose the work of said Society in declaring the present message of God’s kingdom and the day of the vengeance of our God against all parts of Satan’s organization; and said opposing ones have formed themselves into divers and numerous companies and have taken and now bear such names as, to wit, ‘Bible Students,’ ‘Associated Bible Students,’ ‘Russellites teaching the truth as expounded by Pastor Russell,’ ‘Stand-Fasters,’ and like names, all of which tends to cause confusion and misunderstanding :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now, therefore, in order that our true position may be made known, and believing that this is in harmony with the will of God, as expressed in his Word, be it resolved, as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“That we have great love for Brother Charles T. Russell, for his work’s sake, and that we gladly acknowledge that the Lord used him and greatly blessed his work; yet we cannot consistently with the Word of God consent to be called by the name ‘Russellites’; that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and the International Bible Students Association and the Peoples Pulpit Association are merely names of corporations, which corporations we as a company of Christian people hold, control and use to carry on our work in obedience to God’s commandments, yet none of these names properly attach to or apply to us as a body of Christians who follow in the footsteps of our Lord and Master, Christ Jesus; that we are students of the Bible, but, as a body of Christians forming an Association, we decline to assume or to be called by the name ‘Bible Students’ or similar names as a means of identification of our proper position before the Lord; we refuse to bear or to be called by the name of any man;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘ ‘ That, having been bought with the precious blood </span><span class="font5">of Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer, justified and begotten by Jehovah God and called to his kingdom, we unhesitatingly declare our entire allegiance and devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom; that we are servants of Jehovah God commissioned to do a work in his name, and, in obedience to his commandment, to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ, and to make known to the people that Jehovah is the true and almighty God; therefore we joyfully embrace and take the name which the mouth of the Lord God has named, and we desire to be known as and called bv the name, to wit, ‘Jehovah’s witnesses.’—Isa. 43:10-12; 62:2; Rev. 12: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As Jehovah’s witnesses our sole and only purpose is to be entirely obedient to his commandments; to make known that he is the only true and almighty God; that his Word is true and that his name is entitled to all honor and glory; that Christ is God’s King, whom he has placed upon his throne of authority ; that his kingdom is now come, and in obedience to the Lord’s commandments we must now declare this good news as a testimony or witness to the nations and to inform the rulers and the people of and concerning Satan’s cruel and oppressive organization, and particularly with reference to ‘Christendom’, which is the most wicked part of that visible organization ; and of and concerning God’s purpose to shortly destroy Satan’s organization, which great act will be quickly followed by Christ the King’s bringing to the obedient peoples of earth peace and prosperity, liberty and health, happiness and everlasting life; that God’s kingdom is the hope of the world and there is no other, and that this message must be delivered by those who are identified as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“~We</span><span class="font5"> humbly invite all persons who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom to join in proclaiming this good news to others, that the righteous standard of the Lord may be lifted up, that the peoples of the world may know where to find the truth and hope for relief; and, above all, that the great and holy name of Jehovah God may be vindicated and exalted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have willingly and joyfully received this new name given by Jehovah have taken upon themselves a solemn responsibility. When the Israelites stood before Mount Sinai and Jehovah spoke his covenant to them by the mouth of Moses, the people there with one accord said, ‘ ‘ All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.” (Ex. 19: 8) The people there took upon themselves a great responsibility. They had an opportunity to be faithful to their covenant. So likewise when God’s people stood in His presence and said, &quot;We give our vote knowingly and gladly to receive the new name which the mouth of Jehovah God has given us,” thereby all such assumed a grave responsibility before God and each and every one has now the opportunity to prove faithfulness to that name. So likewise every company of anointed ones of God who subsequently adopted or have adopted a like resolution have assumed a like responsibility. This responsibility means that all such, in order to be faithful to God, must faithfully bear testimony to the nations according to God’s commandment. That responsibility cannot be fulfilled by merely developing what is called “character”, and by living a quiet, pure and pious life. It calls for much more than that. It demands of all such who take the name that they use their best endeavors to carry the testimony of warning and of comfort to the people according to the commandment of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Faithfulness in giving the testimony by Jehovah’s witnesses as commanded causes the enemy Satan to concentrate his fire upon God’s witnesses. These are the only ones on earth who really expose Satan and his wicked organization, and who enlighten the people concerning the righteousness of God and his kingdom, and for this reason Satan goes forth to make war against them. (Rev. 12:17) The most subtle instrument he uses in this warfare is the clergy of “organized Christianity”, so called. These men who are apparently pious and pose as representatives of Jehovah God fraudulently induce the officers of the law to believe that they are God’s representatives on earth. They tell the officers of the law that the men and women who are going from place to place with the message of God’s kingdom are enemies of the government acting under a cloak of religion, that they are seditionists and should be apprehended and punished. By this false and fraudulent means they induce the officers of the law to cause the arrest, the trial and imprisonment of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is exactly true to the prophecy uttered by Jesus and others of the prophets and should therefore be of real encouragement to Jehovah’s witnesses. God has commanded them to go through the gates or entrances into the kingdom, and to remove the stumbling-stones and lift up God’s standard for the people. (Isa. 62:10) To that extent they are made leaders of the people. They are thus entering into the kingdom through much tribulation, even as it was prophetically written long ago.—Acts 14: 22.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>THE SOCIETY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Does the adoption of the new name mean that we have abandoned the name and title “Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society”? What is our true relationship to “the Society”? As our Lord and Master Christ Jesus when on earth was in the world, but no part of it, and as he commanded those of his followers to obey the laws of man which did not conflict with the laws of God, even so it is with the members of the body of Christ on earth that go to make up “Jehovah’s witnesses” now. (Matt. 22:21) There are two ways by which a company of people may collectively hold title to property, to wit: (a) By one or more persons holding title in trust for the entire company; and (b) by a company forming a body corporate or corporation. The latter is the more convenient because a body corporate is considered as having a perpetual existence, and there is no necessity for the changing of trustees. Some who claim to serve the Lord have foolishly said that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a man-made organization operated by and under the authority of the Devil’s organization. Such claim is entirely unreasonable and even worse than foolish. Men have not organized governments in order to serve the Devil. They have not even known that the Devil has any power over governments. The purpose of the early settlers of America was to establish a government where they might dwell in peace and worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. The state and national governments were organized with a view of bettering the human conditions. Through false religious leaders the Devil quickly got control over the rulers, but he did so without their knowledge and because they did not wholly submit themselves to Jehovah God. There must be law and order among any people that expect to get on decently, and the laws of the land were enacted for a good purpose. There are millions of people in this land who are no part of Satan’s organization, but they are under it because they cannot help themselves. The true followers of Christ Jesus living in this land are in Satan’s world, but are no part of Satan’s organization. It is entirely in harmony with the will of God that these should obey all regulations of the land which regulations or laws do not contravene God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The company of God’s consecrated people in this land had formed themselves into an organization or company sometime prior to 1884. In that year it was deemed for the best interests of the work of preaching the gospel that a corporation be formed. The result was that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was formed and organized under the provisions of the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and for the purpose of preaching the gospel, as its charter sets forth: “The purpose for which the corporation is formed is, the dissemination of Bible Truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its board of directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the purpose stated. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Society”, therefore, properly applied then and now to the collective body of consecrated followers of Christ Jesus who are interested in his kingdom. The corporate body, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, is the instrument of the company of God’s people to carry on their work. Because it is organized under the laws of the land does not at all mean that it operates by authority of Satan’s organization. If Satan could have prevented the formation of the “Society” and its incorporation, we may be sure he would have done so. For anyone to say, then, that the “Society” is operating by authority of Satan’s organization is a wicked statement. The proper relationship of the “Society” composed of God’s anointed people now on earth to the corporation the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is that the body of people who go to make up Jehovah’s “servant” or witnesses is properly called the “Society”, and the corporation is the servant or instrument of this company of anointed people by which they carry on a part of their work. It was organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, but operates throughout the world. In 1909 the “Society”, to wit, God’s consecrated people, decided to move the operating headquarters from Pennsylvania to New York state, and in order to meet the conditions and enable this company to carry on its work in an orderly way, the Peoples Pulpit Association was incorporated and organized under the Membership Corporation Act of the State of New York, and it works together and in harmony with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. What is said about the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is also true of and concerning the Peoples Pulpit Association, to wit: It is the servant or instrument of the “Society”, God’s consecrated and anointed people, to carry on the kingdom work in an orderly way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later a similar corporation was organized under the laws of England, and under the corporate name of International Bible Students Association. Likewise that corporation is merely the servant or instrument of the “Society”, or company of God’s anointed people, to carry on the kingdom work in an orderly manner. None of these corporations receives any authority from Satan, but all of them are deadly opponents of Satan, and the only ones that Satan is now making war against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Desiring to keep entirely aloof from denominational church organizations, and not being a sect or cult, the “Society”, or God’s consecrated people, adopted no specific name, but generally applied to themselves the name of International Bible Students Association because they were and are students of the Bible and servants of the Lord. Others called them “Millennial Dawnists”, “Russellites,” “Watch Tower Bible people,” and even other names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1918, when the Lord came to Jehovah’s temple and began judgment, the approved servants were taken into the temple and under the robe of righteousness and became a part of the elect servant, which is the anointed, the Christ of Jehovah. Then it was that Jehovah gave to this company a new name, which now they have come to know, and which they joyfully take, and which name is “Jehovah’s witnesses”. The mouth of the Lord has thus named them. That does not at all mean that these have cast away the corporate body which constitutes the servant or instrument used to do their work. They continue to use these corporations as heretofore and for the purpose for which they were organized.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The charter of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its by-laws require an annual meeting to be held at Pittsburgh. Pursuant thereto the annual meeting was convened in Pittsburgh on Saturday, the 31st of October, 1931. There being no servants or officers of the corporation to be elected at this annual meeting, only the usual routine matters of the corporation were considered. This was followed by a convention of the Lord’s people present, all realizing that the chief work is to get the message of the kingdom to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>ORDAINED REPRESENTATIVES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Ordination to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom proceeds from Jehovah, and not from man; but it is strictly within the authority of the Society to select certain men and send them out to represent the Society in preaching the gospel in a more public way. Amongst those thus ordained by the Lord, and who were selected by the Society as its representatives and thereby ordained by the Society, the following are named:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">QUALIFICATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptural qualifications to be had by Jehovah’s witnesses are these: Full and complete consecration to do the will of God and then doing his will; begotten of God, called to the kingdom, responding to the call, chosen and approved for faithfulness, and brought into the temple and under the robe of righteousness. Such then become the children of God by Zion. Of such, full obedience to the commandments of the Lord God is required, so far as it lies within us to obey. Such must be completely devoted to God and then do with his might what his hands find to do, that is, in accord with Jehovah’s expressed will. It is not for any man or body of men to arbitrarily determine just who are Jehovah’s witnesses, but each one must determine for himself whether or not he is Jehovah’s witness, basing his conclusion upon the witness of the holy spirit and his action in harmony therewith. Many may say that they are witnesses of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah, but words count for nothing unless the course of action taken by such proves full devotion to God and his kingdom. This is proven by the creature ’s taking and pursuing a course of action without compromise and wholly on the side of God and his kingdom. As it is written, ‘Be ye holy, because God is holy.’ All of the approved ones of God must be wholly devoted to his cause, and must refuse to have any interest in, share or sympathy with Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that Jehovah has designated a class as His witnesses is proof conclusive that these must bear testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God. In doing this these witnesses will employ and continue to employ such means as God has provided for them to use. Among these provisions are the three corporations above named, printing presses, bookbinding machines, the radio, and other associated means of making known to the peoples of the world that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is here. While it is necessary to purchase machines and other material from those who are of the Devil’s organization, that doesn’t at all make those machines or other material any part of Satan’s organization; and it would be worse than foolish to say that the “Society” is using any of these instruments by the authority or will of Satan’s organization. Jehovah God is the author and creator of all material.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>INCREASING LIGHT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">All light and truth proceeds from Jehovah God, and he increases the light to his children according to his sovereign will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is the official journal of the “Society”, and is published by the “Society” twice each month. It carries the message of truth upon which God’s people feed. Its attempt is to explain the Scriptures as the Lord reveals them to his people. During the year the Lord has abundantly provided for his own through the columns of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font5"> W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">atchtower.</span><span class="font5"> He has made it clear that he teaches those who are children of his “woman” or organization, Zion. As it is written, in Isaiah 54:13, “And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children,” those who are the children of Zion are especially taught of Jehovah. In order to be thus taught now of and concerning the deeper things of God’s Word, one must be a son of God and anointed and must be brought forth and made a part of Zion, which is his organization. God’s children by his woman Zion have been exceedingly joyful during the year and continue in the joy of the Lord, even as he foretold by the words of his prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord has revealed to his children the meaning of the book of Esther, disclosing to them his loving provision long ago made that they might be encouraged now to battle on for the right and be assured of victory against the enemy through Christ our Lord and Head. Many other precious Scripture texts have been illuminated by Jehovah for the good of his people during the year, and which has given them greater strength and increased joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to be expected that some who were once enlightened would turn away from sound doctrine as we approach the great day of God Almighty, because it is written that “the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine”, but will turn away from the truth. No one who is devoted to the Lord will weep for sorrow or be disappointed because someone, even though near and dear to him by the ties of flesh, has turned away from the Lord. The greatest privilege ever granted to any creature is to serve Jehovah; and if anyone doesn’t appreciate that fact, but falls away, such is not worthy of further consideration. During the year 10,781 subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> lapsed and were not renewed. Just how many of these have turned away from the truth we cannot, of course, tell. It is exceedingly interesting also to note that during the year there were new subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 11,819, or a net increase of more than one thousand. Some of these had permitted their subscriptions to lapse the year previous, but, having come in contact with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> were glad to renew their connection with it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God by his beloved Son Christ Jesus does the teaching, because the truth is his. Men are merely instruments to carry the truth to others. The light and truth belongs to the Lord. Such is the life-giving and life-sustaining fruits of the kingdom which the faithful ones bear to each other and to others who are hungry. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is controlled by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, which corporation acts by and through its board of directors. As you know, for some years there have appeared on the title page of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> the names of an editorial committee, provision for which was made several years ago. During the fiscal year, at a meeting of the board of directors a resolution was adpoted abolishing the editorial committee. As you have observed, there appears in the space once occupied by the names of the committee the text here quoted, to wit: “And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.” (Isa. 54:13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Such is much more appropriate. It is also observed that a new cover appears on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and which is in harmony with the Scriptures and the work which God’s anointed people on earth are doing today. These by faith observe Jehovah’s organization moving majestically forward to the full and complete establishment of his kingdom. They have come to an appreciation of the fact that Jehovah God has appointed his anointed ones on earth as his witnesses, and has said to them: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am Jehovah.” His witnesses are therefore on the watchtower, watching what is the will of God and doing whatsoever they can to his honor and to the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Lord has given to his people the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font5"> which is an explanation of the first half of the prophecy of Ezekiel. It is seen that this prophecy fully corroborates the prophecy of Revelation, and is therefore a great encouragement to the anointed. It is therefore corroborative proof that the anointed must bear testimony to the rulers and the peoples of Christendom, serving notice upon such</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of God’s purpose concerning them. This responsibility the Lord God has laid upon his anointed witnesses, just as he laid it upon the prophets to give warning to Jerusalem. This work must be done, and will be done, by the grace of the Lord, by those who really love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the enemy has continued to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses. Many of these faithful ones have been arrested, fined and imprisoned because of their faithfulness in giving testimony to the kingdom of God. Such is to be expected, of course, because our great Master told us that his faithful followers would be hated and persecuted, particularly by those who claim to represent God, but who are in fact hypocrites and the members of the synagogue of Satan. The opposition, however, has not at all dampened the zeal of God’s people. On the contrary, they know that they are right, and therefore with courage and patience go straight forward in the work. The persecution in America has been bad enough, but in Germany it has been much worse. Our brethren in Germany have not been at all deterred by this opposition, but have pushed on with continued strength which they received from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The message of the kingdom has had a great advertisement during the year, in fact more so than in any previous year. The annual report of last year discloses that during the past ten years up to that time, books and booklets in the aggregate number of 93,500,000 had been placed with the people. During the two and a half months following the Columbus convention in July, 1931, the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World</span><span class="font5"> reached a circulation of more than 5,000,000; and the work with that booklet is not nearly completed. The total circulation of books and booklets during the past year, 17,065,401, brings the grand total of the past eleven years up to the aggregate number of, to wit, 110,565,401.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year general conventions of the Lord’s anointed people, at which it was the pleasure of the president to attend, were held at Paris, Berlin, London and Columbus. Reports of these conventions have appeared in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Other conventions have been held in various parts of the earth. All these conventions have been to the great pleasure and profit of the people of Zion, and as a result many more have engaged in the full-time service, and all have been strengthened for the fight. The time has come for the unity of the church under Christ, and the evidence is strong that this condition now exists. Never has there been such a complete and harmonious action amongst the people of the Lord. All these things bear testimony to the fact that we are approaching the grand consummation of our hopes and, above all things, the vindication of Jehovah’s name in the full establishment of his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>EARTHLY HEADQUARTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s earthly headquarters are at Brooklyn. The executive offices are at 124 Columbia Heights, while the operating offices and factory are at 117 Adams street. At the Bethel home the entire company of workers is housed and fed, and grateful are all of us for this privilege and blessing. It is a happy family, although composed of persons of various natural temperaments. The main studio of WBBR Radio Station is at the Bethel home, and the members of the family broadcast at 6:30 each morning, except Saturday, a devotional program which is good not only for the family, but for many within range of the station. Many are the good reports that come to the station from those who enjoy this morning devotional program. Immediately following that program are the morning devotions in the dining room, at which time the daily text is considered. The day is begun aright, and the brethren keep in mind during the day their privilege of being Jehovah’s witnesses. On Monday evening the Bethel family assemble for a study of either </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> or some one of the books. This is a meeting that is blessed beyond the description of words. So great has been the benefit resulting from this meeting that all branch headquarters were requested to institute a similar study at the same time. Responses from the various branch offices show that the brethren are delighted to engage in a study with the Bethel family on the same night. Prayer meeting is held at the Bethel home Wednesday evening, and other meetings on other nights. In addition to this, such time as can be spared is given over in the evenings to private study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>FACTORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The music made by the factory machines is sweet to the ear, because those machines are preparing the message of the kingdom, that the people may have an understanding thereof. Our publishing plant at 117 Adams Street is a model one, and calls forth words of admiration by many worldly men who visit it. The brethren are there not merely to fill in time, but to accomplish a determined purpose. All of them work without a boss. In fact, there are no bosses in the organization of the Society. Unselfish devotion to God and his kingdom is the only motive that the Lord blesses, and the evidence is cumulative that he has blessed and is blessing the factory workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the year, following our usual custom, the work for the ensuing year is carefully outlined, and requisitions made for all necessary material and machinery. As the Lord has prospered the work so preparation is made for the things that are needed during the year that is ensuing. It became necessary during the past fiscal year to purchase a new machine to meet the demands for books, and accordingly another great rotary press was manufactured for us in Germany, and has been installed. This is what is known as a MAN Rotary Press, and we believe that our Society is the only organization in America that is using a rotary press for the purpose of printing bound books. With this press added to our equipment, our factory now is capable of producing 25,000 books of 360 pages each and every day. In addition to this press, we also purchased during the year a milling machine and lathes for our machine shop. With our equipment as now constituted, our own brethren can repair practically all the machines and make a number of new devices to further facilitate the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>MATERIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To enable us to carry on the work that the Lord has given us to do, during the year it was necessary to bring into the factory a large quantity of material each week. During the year we used 1,101 tons of paper in the manufacture of bound books alone. The factory also used 756 tons of paper for the publication of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> and booklets. This is a total of 1,857 tons of paper, or an increase of 254 tons over the previous year. Other supplies required were 214 tons of chip board, 288,988 yards of cloth for bound books, 2,771 rolls of gold tape, 105 barrels of paste, 49,200 yards of crash, 745 spools of thread, and 17,624 pounds of glue. Contracts were made for this material for the year at favorable prices. In addition to the above our own plant during the year produced 10,252 pounds of ink more than it did the previous year. The total amount of ink produced during 1931 was 33,273 pounds. In addition thereto we made 74 gallons of paint to be used on our own property. In addition to the ink used in the Brooklyn plant we also shipped ink to the Society’s factories at Magdeburg and Berne.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The fiscal year of 1931 takes the lead over any other year of the Society’s production of books, booklets, magazines and free literature. A true comparison of the amount of work accomplished in the factory can be gained only when a common unit is used for both years. We therefore use as our comparative unit 16 pages such as appear in the clothbound books, the size of which is 7 x 4i/<sub>2</sub> inches. The following is the total amount of the clothbound books, booklets and magazines manufactured, and also their equivalent in 16-page units, as compared with the previous year, 1930.

<p><span class="font4">INCREASE, 16-page units, 9,445,872</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We find that we have turned out a grand total of 14,288,606 books, booklets and magazines. This is an increase of 3,939,215 pieces of literature over 1930. Speaking in terms of our unit of comparison, or 16-page units, we find that there was a total increase of 9,455,872 16-page units over the previous year. If this increase of 16-page units is considered in terms of booklets only, we would have an increase of 2,363,968 booklets; or, if considered as books, it would be about 430.000 bound volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only has there been an increase in the work accomplished on the books and booklets and magazines, but the total amount of free literature that was distributed from door to door, such as radio folders, question slips, question cards, foreign radio announcements, and other printed literature, is 12,694,025.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also printed on our job press 3,511,000 office forms, such as letterheads, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font4"> reports, etc. Last year we printed a total of 6,586,323 office forms, radio folders and odd jobs, but this year the total is 16,205,025, or an increase of 9,618,702 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason for the 320,884 decrease in the production of bound books is accounted for by the fact that during July, August and September the biggest part of the force was working on the new booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World.</span><span class="font4"> During these three months we averaged only 9,344 books in the bindery daily, whereas the average for the entire year was 13,228. Had it been possible for the factory to operate at full speed in the book bindery at the same time the booklets were being called for in such large quantities, we should have been able to manufacture as many bound books as we did the previous year. However, the demand was not for the bound books, but for the booklets. It is interesting to observe that during this year we made 1,024,449 more ten-cent booklets than we did during the previous year, in addition to the 3,131,690 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was made possible this year to produce more clothbound books in foreign languages, due to the new M-A-N press just installed. It was possible for us to manufacture 340,972 foreign books, as compared with 163,766 last year. We were enabled, therefore, to give a greater witness amongst the foreign-speaking people in this country as well as in other lands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The commandment of the Lord to his anointed is, ‘This good news of the kingdom must be preached as a witness to the nations.’ The Society was organized to preach this gospel by word of mouth and by printed books, and this it is doing. The enemy charges that the Society is a book-selling scheme for commercial purposes. Such charge is not only grossly false, but it is cruel. It shows a disposition to fight against God and his commandment. It may interest you to know that during the fiscal year the books and other literature printed, manufactured and distributed amongst the people was done at a financial deficit to the Society of more than three hundred thousand dollars. This deficit must be made up by contributions of money made by those who love God. Nothing else would induce men to part with their money for this purpose. It is true that the Society takes a small amount of money for the books and booklets, but this is used economically for the purpose of producing and distributing other books. The reason this work succeeds is because it is done by men and women who love God, and therefore God blesses them in their work. By the Lord’s grace his anointed people now have 10 clothbound books and 14 smaller booklets, or a total of 24 books and booklets with which to preach the gospel of the kingdom, and in addition thereto the journals published by the Society. Furthermore, the Society distributes many Bibles, concordances and Bible dictionaries. The most of the people of Christendom possess a Bible, but they do not know how to read and understand it. Our business is to encourage them to study the Bible and to furnish them with books which will enable them to find in their Bibles where the matters which they desire to understand are treated by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shipping of these books called forth much comment from worldly people who came in contact therewith. Our trucks heavily laden with cartons of books drive up alongside the shipping docks from which the ships sail carrying our books to all parts of the earth. Railroad cars are also loaded for shipment to various points in the United States and Canada. Men in charge of this shipping receiving our daily shipments often remark, “As business gets worse, you Watchtower people seem to have more transportation business.” To be sure, these shipping agents do not realize that the Lord has commanded his people to do a work relative to the kingdom, and that he has commanded this must be done speedily. When the Society first opened its offices in Brooklyn, its shipping was transported to the shipping points in a one-horse delivery wagon which was borrowed from a grocer daily at stated intervals. Now the Society daily employs three trucks, and one additional motor car for smaller shipments. During the year ending in 1930, the Society shipped from its Brooklyn factory books, booklets and Bibles to the number of 8,144,626 pieces. During the year 1931 the Society shipped from the same point 10,297,311 books, booklets and Bibles. These were shipped to branch offices, companies, auxiliaries and pioneers, and direct to interested individuals. This is an increase over the literature shipped and distributed for the previous year of 2,152,685 pieces. It shows a decrease in the clothbound books, but a large increase in booklets. This is due mainly to the fact that in recent months the workers have been placing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> booklet in the hands of the people rather than the bound books. Also consideration must be given to the great amount of unemployment and lack of money in circulation, which makes it harder for the people to avail themselves of the opportunity of possessing books and booklets, even at a minimum cost. The Society has put forth every possible effort to reduce the cost of books in order that the people might have them at the least possible price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The grand total of foreign-language books distributed from this factory during the year is 254,910, or an increase of 50,000 above that of the previous year. This distribution of foreign-language literature is noteworthy. It is a real joy to note that the foreignspeaking people in America are showing a greater interest in the truth. It is interesting to note the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory</span><span class="font5"> during the year, which reached a total of 598,911; and although the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Where Are the Deadt</span><span class="font5"> booklet has been distributed for several years, during this year 498,315 were placed in the hands of the people. This shows that the people are wondering what the future holds for them. They know they have no real joy here at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the books above mentioned, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> it is with pleasure that we report that during the year 1931 we have placed on our list 20,867 new subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font5"> In addition to this we have distributed a large number as special editions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>MAIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year our office handled a larger amount of mail than in any previous year. Letters and cards received, 314,946, or an increase of more than 43,000 over that of the previous year. Letters dispatched totaled 307,659, or an increase of 59,259 over the previous year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>FIELD ACTIVITIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The name &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses’’ implies that these must be engaged in giving testimony to the name and purpose of Jehovah God. They are in his employ, acting under his direction. He provides the means by which the testimony is to be delivered. It is the privilege of the witnesses to bear this testimony before others, whether they will give heed or whether they ignore the testimony. It is the advance barrage immediately preceding the great battle. During the first two months of the fiscal year a number of radio stations were linked together by wire, and each Sunday morning simultaneously these stations broadcast the message of the kingdom to those who cared to hear. Then the Lord opened the way for the lectures to be put on in the form of electrical transcription records, and these lectures are now being broadcast over a total of 250 radio stations each week. The result has been even greater than we might imagine. The field workers report a splendid increase of interest amongst the people as a result of the lectures. Briefly, the lectures give the chief points in the subject matter under consideration, and then call attention to the fact that the message, in more amplified form as it appears in the books, is being brought to the doors of the people by “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Many of the field workers find on arriving at the homes that the people are waiting in expectation to avail themselves of the opportunity of reading matter that will help them to understand the Bible. Great joy has resulted to those who are thus engaged in the work. While it is true that financial conditions are very bad, yet the people begin to realize that there must be some good reason for the present distress and perplexity, and they desire to learn what the Bible has to say about it, when they hear that the Bible contains the true and correct answer. The result is that the message of the kingdom is placed in many homes throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pioneers are those whom we have heretofore called “colporteurs”. They devote full time to the field service work. The legal definition of “colporteur” is “one who travels about distributing or selling religious literature”. The word “colporteur”, therefore, does not exactly fit “Jehovah’s witnesses”. They are not engaged in a selling enterprise, nor are they merely distributing literature, but they are bearing testimony to the people in obedience to God’s commandment. The word “pioneer” is a better suited term, because those engaged in this branch of the work are going into territory where the people know little or nothing about the message of the kingdom, and are informing them as to the meaning of the present-day events and what the Lord points out will come in the near future. They are really blazing the way for the people to turn themselves toward the kingdom. Next to them are the “auxiliary” workers, who devote a part of their time to the field work; and then there are those who are members of a company in a community and who devote their evenings, Saturday afternoons and Sundays to the field service. It is all one company of “Jehovah’s witnesses”, but they are thus designated to distinguish the amount of time employed in the work. During the year the combined workers in the United States gave testimonies relating to the kingdom of heaven to the number of 11,049,344. They placed in the possession of the people 1,717,272 bound books, and 4,689,134 booklets, or a total of 6,406,406 volumes of literature. The number of persons engaged in this field work was not always the same, because it is not possible for every one of the anointed to be actively engaged in the work regularly. In the month of September, 1931, the number of field workers reached the high peak; and if they could all devote their entire time to the field work with a like result, we should be compelled to build another manufacturing plant in order to supply the demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention at Columbus, Ohio, was a great aid to the field work. On Sunday, July 26, a chain of radio stations was linked together by wire, while others joined the chain by transcription, and together constituted the greatest number of radio stations ever employed on earth to broadcast one and the same program. These stations sent the message throughout the United States, Canada, Australia and many European countries, telling the people that the hope of the world is God’s kingdom. The total of 450 stations were employed to broadcast this message to the peoples of the world. A booklet containing the message was already prepared, and distribution began immediately thereafter. At the time this report is being written, our presses at Brooklyn are running the fifth million edition of this booklet, while the presses at Magdeburg are printing the fourth million of the same booklet. In less than three months the ninth million edition of this booklet is being sent forth, and this in only two languages. The booklets are translated and being put out in thirty-odd other languages, and this is being done as rapidly as possible, and the purpose is to give this message a wide distribution throughout all Christendom. The Columbus convention not only gave the anointed who attended a great incentive for more work, but was extended to many other cities throughout the land where conventions were held, and in which many of the anointed engaged in the field service work giving testimony. The result has been that many more have entered the pioneer service, and now the greatest number that have ever been engaged in the pioneer service are in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Society installed its own plant for the cutting of wax discs to make transcription records for the radio stations. Now this work is being done by consecrated hands, and it is expected that there will be better results because those who are really devoted to the Lord exercise greater care than those who are on the outside and who do not understand the purpose and importance of the work. These transcription records are now furnished to radio stations in the United States, Alaska, Australasia, Canada, Cuba, France and Hawaii. As a result of the radio broadcasting, thousands of letters containing orders for the kingdom literature have been received at our office. During the year radio lectures relating to the kingdom of God have been given as follows: Lectures by chain programs, 418; lectures by electrical transcription, 8,429; total number of radio lectures given under the direction of the Society in other languages, 1,128; making a total of 9,975 lectures given by radio during the year. No one could more than approximate the size of the combined audiences that have heard these lectures. The Lord has amply provided for the proclamation of the message of the kingdom to the people, and this witness work moves majestically on, and must be finished before Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>COMPANIES OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Heretofore we have referred to the little gatherings of the consecrated in communities as “classes” or “ecclesias”. A Scriptural and therefore more appropriate term is “companies”. In the 68th Psalm, verse 11, it is written, “The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it ”; and that is truly according to the facts. The word is Jehovah God’s, and these little gatherings throughout the land that engage in the work as his witnesses constitute companies or members of his organization. The marginal rendering of this text in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font5"> is, “Great [is] the army of those that published.” Jehovah’s witnesses are, in fact, a part of the militant organization of Jehovah. The Hebrew word translating the word “company” as used in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font5"> is the same word as occurs in the expression “the Lord of Sabaoth”, or the Lord of Armies. It is thrilling when we contemplate the truth of the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is leading on in the fight and his armies are following on after him, and the little companies of witnesses on earth form a part of that great army. In this connection we are reminded of the words of God’s prophet appearing in the 149th Psalm, to wit: “For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation. Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord.” (Ps. 149:4-9) All his anointed ones have some part in this great work, and the part performed by those now on earth is to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name, looking to that happy day when his name will be completely vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Taking the distribution work as a whole, the year 1931 exceeds anything that we have heretofore engaged in to the present time. The number of bound books is less, but the booklets are far in excess of what they have been heretofore. Practically onefourth of all the families in the United States have been called upon in that time, and afforded an opportunity to know about the message of the kingdom. Our reports show that the companies engaged in this work throughout the United States have been in the field service a total of 1,208,021 hours. During the year 1931 we reached the peak in this department of 86,445 combinations. One thing, the campaign of three-for-a-dollar greatly increased the distribution during that time, and now since we are making it four-for-a-dollar for a short time, it is anticipated that the number distributed will be far in excess of what it has been in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Taken as a whole, these companies of &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses” show a degree of efficiency never before manifested in the manner in which they carry on the work. There are more companies now engaged, and they do their work systematically and report promptly. It is interesting to know that twenty percent of the testimonies given in the United States during the past year were given by our Colored brethren and those speaking a language other than English. Many of these used cards upon which their testimony is printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was difficult for a time to organize the work in the Southern states; but now in this part of the country the workers are well organized, and well over the average among them are abreast with any other part of the country. The regional service directors, constantly in the field encouraging and instructing the brethren, have been a great help to this branch of the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>BETHEL FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During each special testimony week of the year, an opportunity has been given to the Bethel family to engage in the field service. In every one of these campaigns practically one hundred percent of the family participated, the only exceptions being the few that had to ‘remain at home with the stuff’. It afforded great pleasure to thus participate in the service, and much joy in the work. The Lord blessed their efforts abundantly. During the 750,000-Testimony Week, 202 members of the family participated in the service and placed 7,317 pieces of literature. The Midwinter testimony period found 189 members of the family in the field. At the same time some were away working on the Florida farm, which accounts for the drop to the lower number. These were enabled to place 5,471 pieces of literature in that campaign. The Watchtower Week, in May, found 198 members of the family in the field work, and they placed 10,163 pieces of literature. In the campaign known as Witness Week, 201 brethren participated in the field work, and placed a total of 30,066 pieces of literature, or about 150 pieces for each member of the family. The enthusiasm of the members of the family was very great, evidenced by the testimonies given at the service meeting, when returned from the field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year service conventions have been periodically arranged throughout the country. At each of these conventions a regional service director has attended, as well as some other brethren in the field. During the year there were five special witness campaigns put on in the country, and despite the great financial depression that exists throughout the land the results obtained in the distribution of literature have been remarkable. The first of these campaigns, known as the 750,000-Testimony Week, was from September 27 to October 5, 1930. During that period 9,015 company workers in the field gave 391,433 testimonies and placed literature with 92,849 persons, with a total amount of 179,466 pieces of literature put in the hands of the people. This campaign demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that if Jehovah’s anointed ones devote the time to the service and endeavor to put in a reasonable number of testimonies each hour, their efforts are crowned with great success. Next was the Midwinter Week campaign, January 31 to February 8. There was an increase of almost two thousand workers over a similar period in the year previous. Some had the idea that a campaign could not be put on in the winter months, but this one demonstrated that their fears were without foundation. During this campaign 217,348 testimonies were given, and literature placed in 49,083 homes, and a total of 108,873 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The third campaign of the year was that from May 8 to May 17, which was the opening of the spring work. This was known as Watchtower Week, and in this campaign 287,578 testimonies were given, literature placed in 62,454 homes, and a total of 149,553 pieces of literature placed. The fourth campaign of the year was International Service Convention Week, centralizing around the Columbus convention. The friends throughout the earth are familiar with this, but in passing we add that during that campaign 1,534,653 testimonies were given by Jehovah’s witnesses. That which enhanced this witness week was the great radio hook-up, the release of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World</span><span class="font5"> and of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font5"> and the enthusiasm that the new name gave to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fifth and final campaign for the year was Witness Week, from September 4 to 13. In this campaign 470,306 pieces of literature were placed in the hands of the people. This required giving testimonies to the number of 748,545, and the result shows that over fifty-five percent of the people to whom the witness was given received the message of the kingdom. The uniform method of presenting the matter as outlined in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> doubtless added much to the efficiency of giving this testimony. To give a detailed report of the regional service work, companies, sharpshooters and pioneers would require entirely too much space, and we must be content here with giving a general summary, which shows a splendid progress of the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>PIONEER WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneer witnesses (heretofore called &quot;colporteurs”) have done a splendid work during the year, and it is with pleasure that attention can be called to this. An effort was made to bring as many of them as possible to the Columbus convention. That convention provided a great impetus to the work, and encouraged those very much who were in the work. The responsibility devolving upon those who had received the name which Jehovah God has named his people has caused many to think more seriously than they had thought previously to the convention. Many of these are seeing that the greatest privilege one enjoys is to be actively engaged in the kingdom service. At this time we are not approaching the coming of the kingdom, because the kingdom is here; and it is our privilege and duty to announce this fact to the people. Following the Columbus convention the list of pioneers was considerably increased. The peak of enrollment was on the 29th of September; consequently the year ended with 1,685 pioneers on the active list and 953 auxiliary witnesses, making a grand total of 2,638 witnesses in the field devoting a larger portion of their time to the witness work. This is a decided increase over the number of the list last year. Looking back to 1920-21 fiscal year, when the total number was only 320, this gives some evidence of the appreciation of the Lord’s anointed of their privilege of participating in the kingdom witness work. These pioneers have gone into isolated parts of the country, bearing fruits of the kingdom to the people who heretofore had heard nothing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These pioneer witnesses of Jehovah in the field worked a total of 1,354,011 hours, while the auxiliaries worked 387,400 hours, making a grand total of 1,741,411 hours of preaching the gospel of the kingdom by going from house to house. It must be remembered that these faithful workers must endure many hardships and live in a frugal manner, and consequently the burdens that they bear are not small. They are a joyful people, however, devoted to the Lord and determined by his grace to have some part in the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The outstanding feature of the report this year concerning these faithful workers is that the pioneers have given testimony in the aggregate number of 4,431,828, while the auxiliaries gave an aggregate number of testimonies of 1,456,146, making a grand total of 5,887,974. This little company of specialists, therefore, have taken the message of the kingdom to a great army of people throughout the land, and when we add to this the company workers, and sharpshooters, it is readily seen that a tremendous witness has been given during the year. The pioneers left books in 1,292,383 homes, while the auxiliaries accomplished the same thing with 377,769 homes. The pioneers alone placed bound books to the number of 974,013, while the auxiliaries placed bound books to the number of 176,003. The pioneers placed booklets to the number of 1,788,570, while the auxiliaries placed 511,178, making a total of 3,449,764 books and booklets placed by these pioneers and auxiliaries, which is in excess of last year’s figures to the number of 440,000. The distress and perplexity upon the people continues, hard times, many places with short crops, with little realized from crops that are raised, many out of employment. The number, however, who are turning their minds toward the kingdom is gratifying, because it shows there is on earth a class of peo-pie of good will who desire to know what is the cause of the present trouble, and in what manner they can expect relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The country is very thoroughly covered by these witnesses of Jehovah. In the United States there are 3,074 counties. Eighteen hundred and seventy-four are open for pioneers exclusively, and 528 have some sharpshooters, and 672 are held by companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. Of the number of counties set aside exclusively for the pioneers, 1,336 were assigned to them, and 426 of the sharpshooter counties also had some pioneer assistance in them, and in 606 of the companies’ counties there were also some pioneers assisting. That means that out of the total number of 3,074 counties, pioneers have witnessed in 2,369 of these counties. This leaves 538 strictly pioneer counties not assigned during 1931, and 102 sharpshooter counties in which pioneers have not worked. Among the states which have not had all their counties witnessed to are, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, Rhode Island; while in the states of California, Florida, Maryland, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Massachusetts there is a remote section here and there which has not been worked during the year, but which had been witnessed to the year previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year pioneers and auxiliaries have been working in countries outside of the States, and working under the supervision of this office. In the Canal Zone during the past year there has been one pioneer who has reported regularly each week, placing a total of 3,151 books and 1,616 booklets in the hands of 1,168 people as a result of giving 6,529 testimonies. In Colombia, South America, there has been one auxiliary reporting, but due to the difficulty of getting literature into that country he has been able to place but a few books, although he has worked 427 hours. In Costa Rica two pioneers and seven auxiliaries have worked during the year with one pioneer who put in part time. A total of 740 books and 380 booklets were distributed by these into the hands of 877 persons, and 3,735 testimonies were given. In Cuba there have been three pioneers during the year, who have placed 786 books and 411 booklets in the hands of 819 people. In Dutch Guiana, South America, there is one pioneer on the list, and for a time there was one auxiliary. Their combined activities resulted in the distribution of 36 books and 1,075 booklets. In Hawaii there is one pioneer who has recently entered the service, and has placed 144 books and 246 booklets, as a result of 90 hours of work, giving testimony to 464 persons. During part of the year one pioneer worked in Honduras, and the remainder of the year this same pioneer spent part-time in Salvador, Central America. In Honduras there were placed 567 books and 385 booklets with 635 people. In Salvador in 31 weeks’ work 419 books and 999 booklets were placed in the hands of 1,147 people, while testimonies were given to 3,244 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Panama there have been one pioneer and one auxiliary engaged in the service work, resulting in the placing of 456 books and 370 booklets, giving 3,049 testimonies, and 510 persons have received literature. In the Philippine Islands one auxiliary has worked 20 weeks, resulting in placing 39 books and 37 booklets. Included in these faithful witnesses in the field are those who were born in 30 different countries outside of the United States, and who have emigrated to America, and also those of the Negro or colored race. These have been so faithful in their work during the year that special mention is made of them at this point in the report. During the year 69 colored pioneers have engaged in the service, and 115 auxiliaries have engaged in the work. These have reported to this office the distribution of 43,415 books and 70,046 booklets, making a total of 113,461. They have devoted a total of 101,189 hours to the witnessing, giving testimonies to the number of 220,789, and placing literature with 68,440 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One Albanian pioneer has worked amongst the Albanians of the country, giving 1,748 testimonies and placing 430 books and 841 booklets. One Armenian pioneer and four auxiliaries have engaged in the work during the past year, reporting 1,437 books and 3,891 booklets, and have delivered testimony to 6,848 persons, 1,416 of whom received the literature. Three Austrian auxiliaries have participated in the field work, reporting 303 books and 1,348 booklets, and 3,198 testimonies given. One Bulgarian auxiliary reported 52 times during the year, and as a result placed 280 books and 547 booklets, and delivered testimonies to the number of 2,175. Four Danish pioneers and five auxiliaries have participated in the field work, and these have delivered a total of 10,625 testimonies, and placed 1,823 bound books and 5,587 booklets in the hands of 4,799 people. One Filipino pioneer and one auxiliary have engaged in the work, and as a result, from 23 reports received from them, there have been placed 175 books and 150 booklets. Four Finnish pioneers and three auxiliaries have reported placing 2,367 books and 7,659 booklets, and delivering 8,492 testimonies. Eight French pioneers and three auxiliaries have engaged in the work during the year, placing 1,096 books and 5,263 booklets, and have delivered 5,999 testimonies. Forty-four German pioneers and 48 auxiliaries have been engaged in the service during the year, and their efforts have been blessed by the placing of 119,198 pieces of literature in the hands of the people, to whom they delivered 116,337 testimonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Greek brethren have been actively participating in the work, 30 of whom have served as pioneers during the year, and 18 as auxiliaries. These have placed 20,202 books and 50,534 booklets, and have delivered 112,986 testimonies. Two Hollandish pioneers and nine auxiliaries are in the field and have reported 817 books placed and 5,000 booklets, and have delivered 12,033 testimonies. Eight Hungarian pioneers and eight auxiliaries have engaged in the service during the year and have reported 1,233 books and 7,570 bookletsand the delivering of 24,607 testimonies. In the field during the year have been ten Italian pioneers and nine auxiliaries. They have distributed 6,967 books, and 34,020 booklets and reported 36,981 testimonies. Two Jewish pioneers and two auxiliaries, all of whom are still active, have delivered 9,558 testimonies and placed 917 books and 2,420 booklets. Two Lettish pioneers have witnessed to 4,245 persons and placed with them 1,101 books and 3,203 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Five Lithuanian pioneers in the field during the year have placed 1,414 books and 2,375 booklets in the hands of 2,017 persons, as a result of giving 4,758 testimonies. One Mexican pioneer and five auxiliaries, of which number four auxiliaries are still enrolled, placed 409 books and 649 booklets and reported 2,426 testimonies. Six Norwegian pioneers and nine auxiliaries have engaged in the work during the year, reporting 17,278 testimonies, resulting in the placing of 4,871 books and 8,832 booklets. Eighteen Polish brethren have engaged in the pioneer work during the year, and 14 others in the auxiliary work. These have witnessed to 32,835 people and placed 2,577 books and 14,981 booklets. One Portuguese pioneer has placed 144 books and 246 booklets, and delivered 464 testimonies. One Rumanian pioneer, working only part time, and one auxiliary, have been in the field during the year. As a result of their efforts 3,383 testimonies were given, 895 books placed and 4,275 booklets put in the hands of the people. Two Russian pioneers and one auxiliary report 5,621 testimonies, resulting in the placing of 490 books and 8,609 booklets. One Serbian brother engaged in the pioneer work has placed 161 books and 401 booklets, and delivered 926 testimonies. Four Slovak brethren worked as pioneers and six Slovak brethren as auxiliaries, and have placed 2,022 books and 6,481 booklets, and delivered 19,013 testimonies. One Slovenian pioneer has worked 47 weeks during the year and placed 1,048 books and 3,077 booklets with 1,660 persons, and given 2,835 testimonies. Two Spanish pioneers and eight auxiliaries have participated in the field work, resulting in giving 4,700 testimonies and placing 719 books and 1,523 booklets. Seventeen Swedish brethren have engaged in the pioneer work and twelve in the auxiliary service. These report 40,995 testimonies, resulting in the placing of 7,433 books and 18,359 booklets. Two Swiss pioneers and four auxiliaries in the service delivered 15,261 testimonies, and placed 1,307 books and 4,267 booklets. One Syrian brother engaged in the pioneer work together with four auxiliaries placed 2,288 books and 1,943 booklets. Two Ukrainian pioneers and one auxiliary reported the placing of 630 books and 2,962 booklets, and the delivering of 7,578 testimonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This division of the Lord’s army made up of pioneers and auxiliaries is small in number, but is strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. They are serving notice upon the people as well as the officials of Satan’s organization of God’s purposes to shortly destroy Satan’s organization and erect in completeness his kingdom of righteousness that will bring everlasting peace and blessings to the people. The results of the field work by the pioneer and auxiliary witnesses for the fiscal year ending in 1931 exceed that of any previous year, and for this we are grateful to Jehovah. This is further evidence that the Lord’s kingdom marches majestically forward regardless of all opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a number of places the clergy have induced the officers of the law to arrest these pioneers, and throw them into jail, and impose fines upon them. In every instance the Society has tried to provide a defense. In some instances the fines were imposed before we could get counsel to those who were restrained. Mention is made here of this as a further corroboration of the activities of Satan and his agencies against those to whom the Lord has delivered the obligation of testifying, and who are keeping God’s commandments with joyful hearts. The pioneers and auxiliaries are happy and joyful people, because they know they are right; and with patience they continue to go forward in the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>COLORED BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">When our Colored brethren were made a separate branch there was considerable objection on the part of some, these having the thought that the Colored or Negro race was being pushed aside. This was not the case, however. It was thought best for the Colored brethren to work amongst their own people, and the results show that this conclusion was correct. They have organized companies throughout the country, and especially the South; and out of these 42 companies there are 543 participating in the active field service. These company servants during the year placed 28,589 books and 71,526 booklets in 37,326 homes. There never has been any organization in America or anywhere else that has done as much for the Colored people in carrying them the truth as these Colored brethren have done amongst their own people. These companies put in 44,916 hours in the field during the year, delivering 181,718 testimonies to that number of persons. The Lord has put his spirit upon them, and they are doing his work. The Lord’s organization is one, divided into different companies, regardless of language, color or previous condition. They see eye to eye, and work shoulder to shoulder. Not all of these Colored brethren are in the companies. As heretofore stated, 69 pioneers and 115 auxiliaries engaged in the field work. During the year these faithful witnesses amongst the Colored people placed 213,576 books and booklets, or an increase over the year previous of 37,630. Thus they have preached the message of the kingdom to the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>OTHER LANGUAGES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Many languages are spoken in the United States by people who have emigrated to this land from other countries. It is therefore necessary to carry at the Brooklyn office literature in practically every language to accommodate the many company workers, pioneers, and auxiliaries. Among the people speaking languages other than English in this country considerable work is done by the English brethren, but a great deal more is done by the anointed who speak these languages as their mother tongue. There are representatives in the United States who are witnesses for Jehovah doing work in 14 different languages aside from the English. In these company organizations there are 4,268 workers who carry the message of the kingdom to the people in their own language. Besides these company workers there are 360 pioneers and auxiliaries speaking 30 different languages, and who engage in the witness work. The placements of literature are included in the general account of distribution, as hereinbefore mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Brooklyn office supplies these companies speaking various languages with the books and other literature. The languages employed are, to wit: German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian, which languages are used in the Brooklyn office. These brethren do the translating of the books into the respective languages, and take care of the proofreading, so that the work among the people speaking these languages may progress. Other translators are employed in the United States to translate books and booklets and furnish the copy to this office, and these translations are carefully proofread, plates made, and books manufactured and shipped to all parts of the world. During the year the Brooklyn factory printed 27 different publications in 20 different languages. Of these various foreign languages we shipped to the branch offices 154,505 bound books, and 100,405 were placed in the United States, or a total of 254,910 clothbound books thus distributed. In addition thereto there were 427,853 booklets shipped to foreign branch offices, and 271,848 foreign booklets distributed amongst the people in America. This office also sent out and distributed 1,011 Bibles in the different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is gratifying to see how the Lord is causing his &quot;Word to be fulfilled, and the message being carried to all nations which go to make up Christendom. Following we give a report of the languages other than English, in which work is done and directed from the Brooklyn office, and the service performed amongst these foreign-speaking people who reside in America, to wit:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark293"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark294"></a>FEEDING THE FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Nine years ago it seemed good to purchase a tract of land on Staten Island. The result shows that such action has had the Lord’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">bless</span><span class="font5">ing. For nearly eight years now Radio Station WBBR, built and maintained thete, has regularly broadcast the message of the kingdom. Opportunity is furnished for service for several of the brethren there. About seven acres of land is under cultivation, and vegetables are grown in season which go a long way to supplying the Bethel family with wholesome food. In addition thereto, a good-sized flock of poultry is raised on the place, which supplies much food in the way of eggs for the family. This is both economical to the Society and beneficial to the Bethel family. This is the second year we have kept three persons in Florida growing vegetables during the winter months for the benefit of the Bethel family. Each week a shipment comes north by refrigerator boat, which is taken to our own cold storage plant and kept in condition to furnish the family with fresh vegetables during the winter months. This keeps them in better shape for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Radio Station WBBR has been greatly used by the Lord. Its regular orchestra, composed entirely of consecrated brethren, furnishes the best music that is heard on the air. Six days every week the message of the kingdom is broadcast from this station, which is a great aid to the witness work in the field. Now a splendid pipe organ is installed at the main studios at the Bethel, which will add greatly to the value of the programs. We are very grateful to the Lord for all his blessings bestowed upon those at the Brooklyn headquarters, who have much delight in serving our King and Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark295"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark296"></a>FINANCES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Those devoted to the Lord have done remarkably well during the year in making personal sacrifices in order to contribute money to carry on the witness work. The contributions are even better than the year previous, notwithstanding the greater depression. In view of the great financial stress throughout the land this shows that the Lord has put his spirit upon his people and made it possible for them to provide funds for the work, much of which has been used for missionary work in foreign lands. To be sure, the Society takes a small amount of money for the books, which money goes for material and other expenses to manufacture more books. There is a deficit this year, but we have no doubt that the Lord will make it up. This is his work, and it must progress to his honor and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is unity amongst the people of God as never before known. Those who have joyfully received the new name now appreciate as never before that they have but one thing to do, and that is to faithfully serve God and his kingdom. The year has brought some severe trials, but the joys and blessings have far outweighed these. Jehovah’s witnesses here by His grace are determined to continue to press the battle to the gate. They rejoice to be associated with others of like precious faith throughout the earth in this blessed work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A summary of the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses in countries outside of the United States is given below. You will observe that there are forty branch offices in different parts of the earth. It is the privilege of the president to have a report every month from each one of these offices over which the Lord has given supervision. These reports must be carefully examined and checked, and correspondence carried on between the branches and the Brooklyn office. This affords much work which brings with it great joy. The reports of these various countries for the year are as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark297"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark298"></a>AFRICA (South and East)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s branch office at Cape Town, South Africa, exercises jurisdiction over a large territory. The workers are few in number, but strong in the Lord, and are zealous for his cause. There has been a steady and healthy increase of the witness work and the amount of literature put in the hands of the people. The booklets are short, but the books are considerably up. The following excerpts from the report from South Africa by the manager briefly cover the progress of the work there:</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark299"></a><span class="font4">Another happy year of kingdom service has come and gone. “The best yet” is the only fitting description of it. It is with pleasure that I can report that our expectations of a year ago have been fully realized. The few in this land who are privileged to be numbered amongst the “called and chosen” and who have “the testimony of Jesus Christ” have been faithfully keeping the commands of God. It has therefore been a year of honoring God’s name. As his witnesses we have endeavored to bring forth the fruits of the Kingdom, and the Lord has added his blessing and given the increase. “The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places” is our sentiment, and fulness of joy has been our portion as we have taken a bold and uncompromising stand on the side of Jehovah and given forth the testimony. We bless the Lord for the counsel he has given us. During the year we have been greatly refreshed and strengthened by “food convenient” graciously supplied to us in the Lord’s own way, viz., through the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The articles on “The Man of Sin ”, “ The Temple ’ ’ and ‘' Esther ’ ’ were most timely and have been of real encouragement to the faithful. They were so opportune that one might almost have thought the author had conditions in this country in </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font4">d and that they were written for our special benefit. The warnings and exhortations from the Word of the Lord have been greatly appreciated and, as our figures show, have enthused us to greater zeal for the Lord’s cause. You will rejoice to know</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">that there has been a healthy increase in all departments of the service work. Fifty thousand booklets were sent out by post last year to the isolated. None were sent out in this way this year, and accordingly our total distribution of booklets is considerably less than a year ago. The total book distribution from the office during the year was as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">SERVICE WORK: A summary of books actually placed in the service work is given herewith. Our figures are in excess of those of last year by 16,855, which represents an increase of 33 percent. This is very gratifying, when it is kept in mind that unemployment, with consequent poverty and distress, has been rife throughout the country. A comparison is made with the figures for 1930. Jehovah’s witnesses in this land appreciate the fact that bound volumes give a more effective witness than booklets, and it is pleasing to note that of the total books placed 60 percent were bound volumes.

<p><span class="font4">Testimonies given in 1931 exceed calls made in 1930 by 26,194. The outstanding feature in the service work during the year has been the special week campaigns. Our little Gideon’s band numbers only about 100, but on each of these occasions we do our best to live up to the scripture, 'every man in his place round about the camp.’ In all there were five campaigns; and these reached a grand climax in International Service Convention Week, when there were more workers in the field and more testimonies given than in any previous campaign. The week came to a happy end with six Columbus convention extensions. Our figures are given herewith:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">PIONEERS: The pioneers have again been in the thick of the fray throughout the year and have given an effective ■witness wherever they have gone. In the Union the kingdom message has been proclaimed on the high veld and bushveld of the Transvaal, across the broad plains of the Orange Free State, around the canefields in Zululand and Natal, in the Transkei and other parts of the Cape Province, and even through sparsely populated and dusty Bechuanaland right to the borders of the great Kalahari desert. The business houses in the bigger towns, such as Johannesburg, Capetown, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, and Kimberley have also been thoroughly combed and many full sets of volumes and other literature have been placed. Great has been the zeal manifested by this little company of Jehovah’s witnesses. Oftentimes they have got footsore and weary, and yet they have kept pegging away; and when the special weeks came round calling for an additional effort they were always in the van giving an inspiring lead to all who love the Lord. The train, automobile and &quot;shank’s pony’’ are all used in getting to the territory. Considerable opposition from the Haman crowd has again been experienced, and yet the Lord sees to it that the door is kept wide open for the witness to be given. Nor bas our attention been confined to the Union of South Africa. Last April two pioneers went to Kenya Colony, in British East Africa. Climatic conditions in that part of the country are particularly trying at certain seasons of the year, and there are many difficulties and obstacles to be overcome. After working Nairobi, the capital, where an excellent witness was given, they found it necessary, for private reasons, to return to the Union. On the way back they contracted malaria, from which one brother died. It was his love for the Lord which prompted him to go, and we hope for him &quot;a crown’’. And now two other young brethren, fired by zeal for the Lord, and knowing that there is much work still to be done in East and Central Africa, have volunteered to go to carry on the campaign there. They are now on the job, and it is hoped on this occasion to complete Kenya Colony and also work Tanganyika, Zanzibar and Uganda. We hope that later it will be possible to work the Belgian Congo and other parts of Central Africa which have not yet had the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">AUXILIARIES: A few of the more active company workers have joined the auxiliary ranks during the year. Much good work has been accomplished, and those participating have been happy in the performance of it. For those who have Scriptural obligations keeping them out of the full-time service, the auxiliary service affords good scope for proving one’s devotion to the Lord. We hope that some others, particularly in the towns where there is so much territory, will put aside quickly the things that don’t really matter, appreciate the importance of the hour and the great privilege of being one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and get busy in this branch of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">COMPANIES: Although the companies have supplied quite a few brethren for the full-time and auxiliary service, it gives pleasure to report that the average number of workers reporting each week has increased. The total number has not increased, but there has been greater regularity in the work and an average of four hours per week has been attained. During special weeks a good effort was put forth, quite a number of the class workers in common with the pioneers and auxiliaries have placed a goodly proportion of bound volumes during the year. Last year bound books placed in the service work exceeded booklets by 10,000; this year bound books are in excess of booklets by 13,000. For every hour spent in the service, the pioneers averaged two bound books and one booklet ; the auxiliaries and company workers, one bound book and one booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SERVICE CONVENTIONS: There were eight service conventions during the year. Those of &quot;like precious faith” who attended were greatly enthused and encouraged to press on with the witness work. The lectures were all based on leading articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> for we appreciate that it is through its columns that the Lord supplies “meat in due season” for the “servant” class. The loyal brethren in this part of the earth appreciate the Lord’s arrangement in this respect, and have neither time nor sympathy for self-appointed channels who teach their own views and who work, not for the unity and peace of Jerusalem, but to satisfy their own pride and selfish ambition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SERVICE LEADERS and PUBLIC WITNESS: Service leaders traveled into many corners of the land to help and encourage those who desire to be helped to a keener appreciation of present privileges and to have their local work organized as efficiently as possible. Ninety-five service lectures and workers’ meetings were held, with a total attendance of 2,116. Public meetings have practically ceased, except for an odd occasion in the isolated country districts where meetings have not been held previously. During the year there were thirty-seven lectures given; 10,000 handbills were distributed; the attendance was 1,871, and 101 books were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NEW PUBLICATIONS: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light, Heaven and Purgatory </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prohibition</span><span class="font4"> came to hand early in the year. We are grateful to the Lord for the clearer understanding of Revelation. The realization that we have been privileged to have a small share in the fulfilment of prophecy, coupled with the vision of those things that must be done speedily, has been an incentive to greater faithfulness on the part of all wholly devoted to the Lord. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven and Purgatory</span><span class="font4"> have been translated into Afrikaans, and we hope to have our first supplies from Brooklyn shortly. Many natives in different parts of the country are hungry for the truth. With your permission, translation of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Harp</span><span class="font4"> and several booklets into Chinyanja, and three booklets into Xosa, is now in progress and, if a reliable translator devoted to the Lord can be found, it is our purpose to have several booklets translated into Sesuto. Many of those amongst the colored peoples who have the mental capacity to understand have a keen appreciation of the kingdom message and cannot get enough of it. It does one good to note their childlike simplicity and trust in the Lord. They have an intense longing for the kingdom to be fully set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE WATCHTOWER and THE GOLDEN AGE: The number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> remains about the same as last year, but as a result of a campaign held during the year there has been a considerable increase in number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> Postage rates on correspondence have been doubled, but the volume of work increases. During the year, 3,654 letters were received and 3,861 sent out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> has just come to hand as this report is made up. It makes the Columbus convention a very real thing and enables us to get the spirit of it. The ‘Warning to Christendom’ thrills us. We rejoice in our new name, and we hope by the Lord’s grace to be worthy of it. The new book with the explanation of Ezekiel’s prophecy, and the new booklet pointing to the kingdom as the hope of the world, are keenly anticipated, not only for the enlightenment and joy they will bring to us, but for the privilege that will be ours to pass on the good message they contain to others. In concluding this report I should like to assure you that your brethren in this land greatly appreciate your loving zeal for the Lord and his cause and rejoice to be associated with you and all others of like precious faith in the work of witness now being given to the honor of Jehovah’s name. To him do we render our thanks and praise for the many privileges and blessings enjoyed in the past year, and in his strength we go forward with courage and confidence into the new year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark307"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark308"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Amidst much persecution instigated in every instance by the clergy, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to push the work in the countries of West Africa. The financial condition is very bad in these countries, and this together with the persecution is causing the people to give more heed to the message of the kingdom that is brought to them. Several of the brethren have been arrested and brought into court and their books seized, but after a hearing by the court have been released. The report submitted by the local manager discloses that the output of books exceeded that of the year previous. During the year 45 public meetings were held, with a total attendance of 10,580; company meetings, 308, with attendance of 3,120; letters received, 360; letters sent out, 352; the total number </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">bound books, 13,855, and booklets, 8,598, making </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">total of 22,453 books and booklets.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark335"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark336"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Australian Branch office at Strathfield, New South Wales, exercises jurisdiction over Australia, New Zealand and the South Sea Islands. Like other parts of the earth, the financial and economic conditions are very bad in these countries. Notwithstanding this and other handicaps that the Devil has put on the people, and on the Society, the Lord’s witness work has progressed in a splendid degree. The following excerpt from the local manager’s report speaks for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To Jehovah God is due all praise and honor for what he has enabled his people to accomplish during the past year. Distress of nations and perplexity, as stated in the scripture, has indeed been manifest, and the people of the South Sea Islands have had their share of the suffering brought about by the Devil’s organization. To the Lord’s people the depression is a source of encouragement, because, as the Scriptures state, when you see these things coming to pass, rejoice, because deliverance draweth nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a decided increase in every branch of activity in connection with the work in the field, more companies organized, and the brethren generally brought under the direction of the organization, with the result that a greater witness has been given to Jehovah’s name. Service conventions held during the year proved a great stimulus to the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PIONEER SERVICE: Many new names have been added to the list of pioneers, and today in the field there is a noble band of workers whose one aim and object in life is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by word of mouth and the placing of the message in printed form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REGIONAL SERVICE: Brethren have been sent to visit the classes to encourage them in organization and help them in a general way to more efficiently present the message of the kingdom to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RADIO: This branch of the service received new life as a result of the electrical transcription of Judge Rutherford’s lectures. Reports are coming to the office showing how the people are appreciating these lectures, and we are confident that during the next year this branch of the service will be extended considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE ISLANDS SURROUNDING AUSTRALIA: The work during the past year has been extended to Fiji, Tonga, New Guinea and Java. In each of these places much good has been done and the message received gladly. In addition to books being placed in English, progress has been made in translation work in the respective languages, and next year should see a wonderful increase in the placement of literature in these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FOREIGN-SPEAKING: Quite a number of books have been placed with people speaking foreign languages, books in 33 different languages being kept on hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SPECIAL WEEKS: The brethren associated with this branch fall in line with the arrangements made at headquarters in connection with special weeks, and we finished up tie year with the glorious International Surprise Week, which was the best witness given throughout the year, almost 23,000 pieces of literature being placed in the hands of the people during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate the privilege of being associated with their brethren throughout the earth in the work of spreading the message of the kingdom and vindicating Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark337"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark338"></a>BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">While the work on behalf of the blind people is not very extensive, yet it is steadily progressing. Literature is printed in the Braille and distributed in libraries and sent to individuals in the United States, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, England, Scotland and Canada. The radio has found a number of the blind interested, and these have obtained the literature. We are glad indeed that the Society is able to do something in their behalf, and that those who are hungry for the truth are getting a knowledge of the kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark339"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark340"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Brazil the political and economic conditions are very bad. Added to this there has been a revolution, which puts people in a bad state of mind, and everything is unrest. Surely the Lord’s Word is being fulfilled there in this, that there is much distress and perplexity. With this handicap it has been difficult to do much work during the year. Our little office at Sao Paulo has printed 50,000 handbills, 50,000 tracts, 5,000 forms and copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> received 330 letters, and dispatched 374 letters, and 150 packages of books and booklets, besides distributing several thousand tracts. The output of books during the year is only 4,018 books, and booklets 7,029, making a total of 11,047. Even with this small result the ardor and zeal of the brethren has not slackened at all. They have been more active in the house-to-house service than heretofore, but the great handicap of unemployment and no money in the hands of the people makes it exceedingly difficult. The little company of Jehovah’s witnesses in that land are the only ones that are taking the people real consolation, and while they have been unable to place in the hands of the people a great number of books, they are bearing the testimony and delivering it to His honor. Fifty public meetings were held during the year, with an attendance of 4,200 persons. The little company of Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil have many difficulties to overcome, but they have much joy in the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark341"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark342"></a>BRITISH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the British Isles has gone forward during the year. The British brethren who are in the service are very zealous, and the results show that they have been diligent in the service. Doubtless there is no country under the sun where the people have a general knowledge of the Bible to the extent that the British people have, and yet a comparatively small number are really interested in God’s kingdom. The work has not greatly increased, but there is a healthy increase, and in view of the great handicap of depression and unemployment, this is very gratifying, to say the least of it. The manager of the British office at London covers the situation in brief in his report in the following words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is again my privilege to send to yon the yearly report of the work of the Lord in this part of his field of operation, namely, Great Britain and Ireland, as that work is in the hands of his faithful remnant in these lands. I am very pleased to be able to say that the output of books and booklets from the London depot is slightly in advance of that of last year. We should have liked to be able to report a large increase, but in view of some unfavorable conditions I think it may be considered that though satisfaction in this respect has not been gained, the position has been well maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The band of faithful workers in the Lord’s army in these countries is not increased in number, but we are certainly expecting some increase in the number of those who will come to the side of Jehovah in this great day of battle, so that his purposes here will be fully accomplished. In the meantime the faithful remnant will carry the battle to the gate; they will continue to do the work set for them by the commandment of the Lord, and shown so clearly by his expressed will. It seems strange that these countries, excepting only southern Ireland and that part of northern Ireland which has been and is under the control of the Boman Catholic church, have not shown greater willingness to receive the truth, but the fact is that Protestantism has blinded its people as completely as, by denser darkness, the Roman Catholic peoples have been darkened. These countries have had more light on the Bible than any other lands, and in proportion have made less use of it than some. Besides this, the persistent witness of the past few years has been carried to the homes of all these peoples, telling them of Jehovah and of his purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The abominations of Babylon have enticed and entangled the peoples, and as yet there are only a comparatively few who weep because of those abominations. The opposition of organized religion and the indifference of the people to the reign of righteousness does not discourage the Lord’s faithful remnant. In the full assurance which is now theirs through the glorious opening out of the Word of God, especially in the last publications, which the Lord has given us by your hand, the opposition of the enemy actually helps the Lord’s people in that it sets their spirit in greater determination to do the work of witnessing to the establishment of the kingdom and to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total output of books and booklets is 1,221,138, a slight advance of 4,972 pieces on last year’s figure. Of this number, 450,601 are bound volumes and 770,537 are booklets. In placing these with the people, 5,484,870 testimonies are recorded, which means that a good proportion of the homes of the people have been visited during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This branch of the work continues to be the readiest channel for the distribution of the truth to the people and for the witness. There are 365 companies enrolled for service, and 5,033 brethren holding permits, that is, that number are registered for service. The service workers have placed 217,867 bound volumes, and 398,819 booklets during the year. Each of these figures is slightly in advance of that of last year. We are glad that despite difficulties and some opposition the brethren have held their own and slightly advanced. The bound volumes placed show a small increase of 1,202 volumes, whereas the booklets show a decrease of 66,491, which probably is accounted for by the fact that last year there were still some of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Peoples Friend</span><span class="font4"> in circulation. The number of hours worked by the brethren, 451,360, is 36,000 in excess, of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again it has to be recorded that some of the little companies of brethren have declined or have not seen their privilege of a complete association with the Lord’s organization, in that they have failed to organize themselves for service. Further, that the percentage of permit holders who actively enter into the work does not reach more than 55 percent. Of course, there are many brethren who hold permits who cannot always get out into the work, through infirmity, both of body and through age, and by reason of limited opportunities, and no doubt these things keep the percentage at a low figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further, the number of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> readers continues to be considerably greater than the number of workers. No doubt, again, there are many who are interested in the truth sufficiently to desire to read about it who are not moved by it to cause them to take an active part in Jehovah’s work. But the word has already gone forth to the Lord’s people, ‘ ‘Let </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> that heareth say, Come. ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers have continued to do well in this so greatly favored part of the Lord’s work. The average number enrolled is 215 pioneers and 155 auxiliaries. Of these there have been an average number of 196 pioneers in service, and 118 auxiliaries. The total output of volumes is 180,754 bound books and 182,456 booklets for pioneers, and 42,698 bound books and 49,970 booklets for auxiliaries, or a grand total of 223,452 bound books and 232,426 booklets. The hours registered in this service are 284,600, while 1,845,211 testimonies have been given. These figures show an increased efficiency and purpose in these witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you know, many of our pioneers have gone over to France to help in the witness work there. Besides that, some of them have gone farther afield. We are glad to think of our brethren who once labored with us now earnestly working abroad in other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIONAL DIRECTOR SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of companies in these countries is 392: some of the smaller companies have ceased to exist. Of these, 365 are organized for service. The regional directors have visited them as often as possible, but the directors’ own service in testimonies and placing literature has not been so productive as last year. They have placed 6,679 pieces of literature and have traveled 27,355 miles in their work. Unquestionably this service to the brethren is profitable in every way to the welfare of the brethren: preaching sueh as used to be practiced has lost its practical value, especially in comparison with the service rendered by the earnest director.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of these, 24 have been held during the year, and in each case there has been a manifestation of the Lord’s blessing with his people. The total number in the witness service at these sessions is 8,748, and the number of pieces of literature placed is 20,884. Here, again, it is noticeable that the advantage of the service conventions is out of all comparison with the local conventions which used to be held when there was no special work set for the Lord’s people. Those who now go to the conventions go not to hear so much as to do, and they know that what they hear will be words of encouragement helping them in the work that they feel the Lord has laid upon them to do. Consequently the joy of the Lord is a present experience and strength is renewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding events of the year were the two general conventions, the first in Paris, the next in London. It may seem strange to include a convention held in Paris in this note, but as 800 British brethren attended the Paris convention, and it proved to be an important event in the British work, it must surely have its place. The London convention was indeed an outstanding feature in its stimulus to the brethren, and in a clearer realization than ever of actual unity and of purpose. It was evident that the brethren realized this as you spoke to them on the Lord’s work and the call for service in view of the present conditions. It proved to be in its measure a preparation for the Columbus convention in all that that meant to the brethren in this country, as to all the Lord’s people throughout the earth. It has seemed to the brethren here as if Columbus were very near, surely because the Lord is bringing his people into one compacted whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are now looking forward to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, and preparations are being made in London and throughout the British field for a fulfilment of your wish, that is, that there shall be not only a general distribution of the booklet by a thorough house-to-house witness, hut a particular one also to all those who in any way represent Satan’s organization, however highly they may he placed in it. The brethren are looking forward to this with earnest anticipation, and there seems a good prospect of the million copies which you are sending us getting into the hands of the people quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The general financial condition of the country has remained much the same as it was when the last report was sent, though it has always been getting worse rather than better. The unemployment figures have increased by 1,000,000; but as was then pointed out, since all these have been on the insurance fund, commonly called the &quot;dole”, it has meant that there has always been some money week by week in the hands of the people. At the present time although there has been a financial crisis which has resulted in the £’s deteriorating in value in comparison with most other currencies, the domestic prospects are rather brightened, and at the moment are certainly more favorable in this respect, namely, that many local manufacturers will be stimulated and there will be renewed activity in cotton, woolen, coal, iron and steel industries. It may be that the cost of living will rise, but for the time being there will be a little more money. This, with the reduced rate on the books which you have authorized to commence with our new financial year, should prove an immediate stimulus to the work, and we are looking forward to the British Branch’s reporting a very considerable increase in output, if it shall please the Lord to continue the work till next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The financial crisis is certainly making a stir amongst the more enlightened of the people, and there seems to be an indication that they will listen to our message now much more readily than was the case when the World War broke out. The turmoil and the fury of the war hid its disastrous consequences; besides, many were made rich by it. Now these same people are beginning to see that the foundations of the earth are out of course: their money is going, or they are afraid it may go, and as money is to them the foundation of all earthly things, they are beginning to wonder at the things which are coming upon the earth. I believe we have a better chance of speaking Jehovah’s message to these people than at any other time previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family have continued to enjoy their privilege of service, and have been quite active. During the year 24,245 testimonies have been given, and the total of books and booklets placed is 8,553.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark343"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark344"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the isolated parts of the earth a few of the Lord’s witnesses hold up the banner of truth that the name of Jehovah may be known amongst those that desire to know. In British Guiana the little company still press forward. From the local manager at Georgetown, Demerara, report comes that the little company are still holding faithfully to the work the Lord has given. From his report the following excerpts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No more appropriate description could be given His people at the present time than “the remnant”, and we in these parts feel like a remnant of “the remnant” as we consider our numbers and efforts in past days as compared with those of the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great amount of poverty and distress referred to in our last annual report has been no less during the period under review, and our work has been done under most discouraging conditions (so far as results visible go).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our total placements, 2,462 bound books and 2,321 booklets, have been about one-half of our normal output; but we feel assured that the Father will make allowances for the special circumstances attendant upon life here. We have endeavored to deliver the witness in the outlying districts with some measure of regularity, and, of course, the city of Georgetown is regularly worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We append herewith the usual summary, and take this opportunity of extending our deep appreciation and warm love for you, the Bethel family, and all the Lord’s people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One outstanding feature of the year’s work was the reproduction of your convention lecture, ' ‘ The Hope of the World,” by electrical transcription, and it surely was good to see the interest manifested by the 900 people who attended. We hope to extend our operations along this </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">lin</span><span class="font4">e in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark345"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark346"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Under the Canadian Branch the work throughout Canada and Newfoundland is directed. Some portions of Canada have been exceedingly hard hit by drought and by a great economic depression. In spite of all this, from the natural standpoint the work has progressed, and the fiscal year just ended witnesses the greatest yet in the distribution of the literature concerning God’s kingdom. The local manager’s report to this office well describes the situation as well as the progress of the work, in the following excerpts taken therefrom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">LITERATURE DISTRIBUTION: That Jehovah’s witnesses have been very faithfully carrying out their commission to 'preach the gospel of the kingdom’ is evidenced by the fact that during the year 801,092 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people, the greatest distribution ever made in one year in the history of the church in these lands. Of this number, 206,830 were </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklets, 125,949 bound volumes, and the balance miscellaneous booklets. This shows an increase of 135,030 pieces of literature over last year’s output.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of testimonies given, and of obtainers, or placements made, during the year reached the gratifying totals of 1,201,105 and 354,986 respectively, an increase of 25.7 percent in testimonies and 45.9 percent in obtainers. To accomplish this work an average weekly army of 797.3 served a total of 268,361 hours in the field, which is an increase of 10.7 percent in workers and 21.4 percent in hours over last year. The largest</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">number o£ individual workers engaging in the service in any one week numbered 1,629, this being during Witness Week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the various features which have tended to help and strengthen the friends in their service have been the special witness weeks. These are greatly appreciated by the brethren everywhere and have brought forth results that could not otherwise have been readily obtained. Almost without exception each new witness period surpasses those previously held, and during the last world-wide witness week all previous records were shattered, the number of Jehovah’s witnesses in the field, the hours spent in the work, literature placed and the number of obtainers, etc., being far in excess of any result obtained prior thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As might be expected, the continued activity of the Lord’s people is stirring up considerable opposition from the clergy and the police officials; but the more they oppose, the more determined His remnant is to carry on the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PIONEERS: During the year a monthly average of 126 pioneers were engaged in the kingdom work as compared with 87 last year, the largest number reporting during any one month being 157. Despite the distressing economic conditions which have prevailed throughout the country, this faithful little army show a splendid increase in results over last year. During 1931 they placed 305,402 books and booklets, an increase of 40.3 percent over last year; their testimonies numbered 487,208, an increase of 39.8 percent; and their obtainers, 140,609, an increase of 57.9 percent; while their hours in the field totaled 115,287, as compared with 77,830 last year, an increase of 48.1 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The monthly reports received from the pioneers are a source of tremendous encouragement and strength to us all here. It is a joy to note their abounding faith in the Lord’s providence on their behalf and how he opens up the way for them to carry on despite the many obstacles placed in their pathway by their adversary the Devil</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RADIO: The outstanding feature of the year’s radio activity was, of course, the chain broadcast from the great Columbus convention, in which thirteen stations were actually linked up by wires and 21 broadcast the electrical transcript.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While it is impossible to obtain any idea of the number who listened in to your lecture upon that occasion, it is very manifest from the large number of requests received at this office for copies of the lecture, and the reports given to the workers in the field by those who listened in, that the audience was very great indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Equally great, if not greater, has been the witness given during the year by the electrical transcripts. All told, 21 stations are contracted with for this weekly feature, and the regularity with which this witness is being given is driving home the truth in no uncertain way, breaking down prejudice, opening up the minds of the people and destroying the influence of the clergy in a most effective way, and thereby preparing the field everywhere for the workers as they go from door to door. This, beyond question, has largely accounted for the splendid results obtained by the workers during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we bear in mind how angry Satan and his forces were at our radio activities at the time our licenses were canceled, it is pleasing indeed and gratifying to note how the Lord has defeated his attempt to curtail the activities of His witnesses in the earth, for at that time we had but ten stations broadcasting the truth, while today we have twenty-one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The financial loss to the Society through the government’s action was, of course, very heavy, amounting to $31,579.35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the clergy class have been greatly ‘ ‘ riled ’ ’ because of this activity of Jehovah’s witnesses and because of our again broadcasting in the Toronto district, is evidenced by their howl through the press owned by the principals of their flock. Characteristic thereof are the editorials which appeared on the church and radio pages of the Toronto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Globe.</span><span class="font4"> Among other things the paper says: “Now we have the International Bible Students on the air once more, this time on stations where they are presumably buying time, or, at least, on stations whose licenses are taken out by parties other than themselves. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a feature directly connected with the radio work it would be well at this point to mention the fact that in advertising the chain broadcast from Columbus over half a million handbills were distributed in Canada and Newfoundland, and in connection with the general advertising of radio a further 300,000 were distributed, making over 800,000 in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total number of radio programs broadcast during the year was 972, of which three were in the Ukrainian language, one in Polish, and one in German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS: In addition to the regular service of these brethren to the classes directly, their efforts this year have been largely occupied with the convention series and, in this connection, they have done excellent work, not alone in setting the workers an example by their own activities in the field, but also by their encouraging talks based upon the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles. Over and above all that, however, their actual results in the field have been splendid. They have made a good witness, encouraged and built up the brethren, and have thereby been strengthened and encouraged themselves in the faith, becoming stronger in every way through service. May the Lord’s blessing continue with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BOAT SERVICE: The boat on the Pacific coast has been kept going throughout the entire year, with splendid results. It has covered territory which it is impossible to reach by any other means, and while it is a little more expensive to operate than carrying on the service by motor car, the results have more than justified the expenditure, and those engaged in the work are very enthusiastic in regard thereto. The obstacles to overcome are, of course, many; but as the workers come face to face therewith and put forth all their strength to carry on, the Lord graciously opens the way and blesses them beyond expression in words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year, despite the opposition of the American officials in Alaska, we succeeded in getting the boat into that country, and an excellent witness was given along the Alaskan coast, while the Canadian west coast was also thoroughly covered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 12,463 pieces of literature were disposed of in this branch of the service, 5,893 testimonies were given and 2,482 placements made. Three brethren engaged in the work, spending a total of 2,377 hours in the actual field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">KINGDOM BOOKLET CAMPAIGN: The enthusiasm of the friends returning from the Columbus convention, together with the inspiration received by reason of your broadcast by those remaining at home, portends to make the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet campaign the greatest blow ever dealt Satan’s organization in this land. While the campaign has been held up somewhat by reason of the fact that we were unable to obtain these booklets rapidly enough to meet the demand, it is now in full swing and, as shown above, some two hundred odd thousand copies of the booklet have been placed in the hands of the people as at the close of the fiscal year. Orders now in hand indicate that when this campaign has been completed some five hundred thousand of the booklets will have been distributed. The largest circulation of any individual booklet heretofore was that of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom</span><span class="font4"> booklet, the total number of this booklet being placed in Canada and Newfoundland being 285,268.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you are aware, the Canadian population is a very mixed one, and our records show that literature has been distributed in this country in no less than thirty-six languages. The total placement of books and booklets in foreign languages amounted to 103,890, as compared with 90,382 last year. Of this number, 14,518 were bound volumes. The greatest demand was for French, German and Ukrainian, the French ranking first in distribution and the German second. It is interesting to note that the Ukrainian brethren placed 60 percent of the literature distributed in that language, while it was the English-speaking brethren who placed the greater portion of the literature in French, German and other languages. This is accounted for in part by the fact that there are 287 Ukrainian brethren, while there are very few of the other nationalities professing consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bulgarian, Finnish and Italian placements, particularly the Bulgarian, show a very large increase as compared with last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hand of oppression is resting more heavily upon this country day by day. For now almost two years the great prairie provinces have felt it in no uncertain way, while Ontario and Quebec have, comparatively speaking, been prosperous. Slowly but surely, however, as industry upon industry is forced to close its doors or curtail its output, and the great railway systems are forced to lay off thousands of their employees because of lack of business, the depression is reaching to the east.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the deplorable condition of the west the reports are most distressing. As characteristic of this condition I quote from a letter recently received from a very capable and zealous pioneer as follows: “Conditions generally are desperate in the west. Many farmers are shooting their horses and cattle because of no water or pasture. Many families are without sufficient food, some with potatoes and eggs only. Some children have collapsed in school, and upon investigation it was found the cause was lack of nourishing food. We find many in tears, completely discouraged, with perhaps an inch of drifted soil on the floor of the house. There have been a few scattered showers, but not enough to relieve crops from drought. Many roads are impassable because of drifted soil. I had to leave the highway three times yesterday within four miles. What few autos are on the road carry a shovel the same as if it were winter with snow. ’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another brother reports: “This land is one big desert. You can travel hundreds of miles and not find a blade of grass on the roadside; and it is growing worse day by day, if you could imagine such a thing possible. In two or three weeks roughage will be depleted for stock, then whatf People are now treking north in quest of feed and fuel, and in a few days that too will be possible only by rail, as there is no feed on roadsides for stock, from the boundary line 200 miles north. At Wilcox they haven’t had a good rain for three years this month. It was once considered one of the garden spots of Saskatchewan. The water they have stored in cisterns was salvaged from dugouts in the springtime, and today is much like soup. Even at that, it is quite palatable when one is thirsty. They have also been afflicted with terrible dust storms this spring, so bad at times you would have to turn car lights on at 12: 00 o ’clock noon, more farms in the air than on the ground. Even at that, it came with such force as to relieve the farm buildings from their paint, and we have had one this week lasting pretty nearly two days. Have yet to see one garden in Saskatchewan this year. You may think I am trying to paint a word picture of desolation, but my command of the English vocabulary is too limited to even attempt such, and through it all the Lord’s message is going grandly on; more booklets, however. If you saw the prospects you would even marvel at that. In Moose Jaw stores open only at noon; other towns where paid help works will soon follow suit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the condition amongst the farming element is rapidly nearing the intolerable mark, the army of unemployed in industrial and other centers is increasing in leaps and bounds. The government is desperately trying to contend with the situation by carrying on works of a public nature, such as the building of highways, bridges and subways, improvement of ocean ports, etc.; but to all thoughtful men their effort to stop the rising storm must result in failure. Even as the Master foretold, the hearts of the ruling classes are failing them for fear, looking forward to those conditions that all can now see are rapidly coming upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Outstanding among the blessings the Lord has showered upon his people during the year, and greatly cherished by them, have been the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">articles. Surely the Lord has been true to his word and spread for his servant a table of plenty in the midst of their enemies. At this table we are greatly privileged to feed day by day and thereby receive strength to zealously carry on as his witnesses in the great battle of light against darkness, of truth against error. I rejoice, even as do all his people throughout the land, in the large measure to which the Lord is using you in his service as the visible head of his organization on this side of the veil, and in how manifestly his blessing is Testing upon you as you strive to serve his cause and people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The summary of the work in the countries under the jurisdiction of the Central European office is first given, and followed by the respective countries within that jurisdiction. The following excerpts are taken from the manager’s report to this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the sixth time it is my privilege to submit to you the annual report for the Central European office, which has jurisdiction over the following countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Holland, Italy, Poland, Bumania, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the countries above mentioned, we had set a quota of one million books and booklets. It was surpassed to the amount of 288,153 books and booklets. Fourteen hundred and sixty-seven company workers, 100 less than last year, and 136 pioneers (63 more than last year) have distributed amongst the people 189,609 books, 1,143,904 booklets and 225,660 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> Including the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies, we have a total distribution of one and a half million pieces of literature. Aside from this, 3,863 Bibles were placed and 7,450 new subscriptions for the German and the Polish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The five special service weeks, as suggested by headquarters, have proven a great blessing. In these five weeks of special effort, 46,368 books, 289,595 booklets and 41,970 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies were put out, which represents a fifth of the total distribution for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first service week, at the beginning of the year, brought good results; for during that week 144,295 witnesses were given, and 66,000 books and booklets placed. The Surprise Week, however, brought a greater surprise, in that 90,000 books and booklets were put out by Jehovah’s witnesses, and the quota of 22,000 hours of work was surpassed by 1,000 hours. However, the most marvelous part of our record is the wonderful progress of the pioneer service in Belgium and in France. The first international convention ever held in Paris, at which our dear Brother Rutherford was present, was a deciding factor for many. At that time it was made known that in these two countries, with a population of more than 40 million people, a large part thereof has never heard anything of the establishment of God’s kingdom. Thereupon hearts began to burn, and many enrolled for the full-time service in France right after the convention. Since then more pioneers have enrolled, amongst them English, German, French, Polish, American and Swiss brethren, most of whom do not speak the French language. They have now moved into the proud country of France and into the very Catholic Belgium. By the Lord’s grace, they are now witnessing to these people, and “How have they succeeded?” is the question often addressed to us. We can only answer: ‘The Lord has done great things for them. They have received fulness of joy in the presence of the Lord. ’ A record of their success is found separately in the report of the respective countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE FACTORY AND THE OFFICE AT BERNE: The increasing demand for books in France, Belgium, and other countries has justified the purchase of new machines and equipment to increase the capacity of our plant. We thank you, Brother Rutherford, for providing the money for the purchase of two new bookbinding machines. They are now installed and work satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this added equipment, our capacity is increased to an output of 500,000 bound books and 1,000,000 booklets a year and, as the German manufacturer told us, we are now the best equipped and largest printing and bookbinding establishment in Switzerland. We have the first Smyth bookbinding machines installed in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our production this year has increased. We have printed 3,056,006 pieces of literature, 108,639 books, 1,420,881 booklets, 833,343 magazines and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font4"> and 693,143 leaflets, etc. These publications were printed in 14 different languages, to wit: Danish, English, Finnish, French, German, Hollandish, Italian, Lettish, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Slovenian, Swedish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By way of comparison we note that we have produced:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(particularly France needs more books); and thus we must produce in one year at least 300,000 clothbound books and 1,560,000 booklets, not counting our orders for northern Europe. In order to supply this demand, our equipment had to be increased and more men had to be employed. We are grateful that the Lord has given us the necessary means, and we are confident that with the installed new machines and better equipment we shall produce greater results for the glorification of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BETHEL FAMILY: Every member of the family (49) is happy and grateful that the Lord has provided plenty of work and also the other necessary things. On account of the Budden increase of the work, we have had to work extra hours and could not devote as much time to the field service as during the previous year. Nevertheless, the Bethel family has distributed 1,500 more books than last year, or a total of 4,332 books, 16,648 booklets and 3,425 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Berne office received 11,986 pieces of mail and dispatched 10,005.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For translation and correspondence in different languages, we need brethren from other countries. Recently the Swiss authorities, or the Department of Labor, consulted with some of the preachers of Berne, evidently members of this board, before giving permission for a Rumanian brother to enter. This then was refused. The case was handled by our lawyer, the police authorities were also in our favor, with the result that the brother is now here. So the preachers lost out!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking about us, we behold the shaking of the nations, and Switzerland too is beginning to feel the trouble. The suffering and the perplexity is increasing. No power on earth can bring peace; but the witnesses of the Lord have peace, because their mind is stayed upon Him and upon His work. No difficulty and no trouble can drive them away from their duty as the Lord’s anointed. No persecution, no slander can shake them, because their trust is in the Lord; and with hearts moved by unselfishness, they are working together in unity and love. Unitedly, with one spirit, regardless of national or other human differences, they continue to proclaim that the kingdom of God is here and that this alone will bring justice to the poor and help to the oppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In closing this annual report, I gladly acknowledge Jehovah as the Giver of every good and perfect gift. The brethren throughout Central Europe send their love and greetings to you, Brother Rutherford, as their visible leader. They are more closely united than ever before. They have entered the final phase of the battle for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and are rejoicing greatly to have a part with all faithful witnesses therein. They appreciate what the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font4">(Book Two, page 287) says: “[Jehovah] shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm,’’ and no power dare interfere with it. (Isa. 30: 30) They verily believe that within a short time, in Armageddon, the name of Jehovah and His word shall be vindicated. With gladness, therefore, as Jehovah’s witnesses, they continue to shout forth the praises to His name and to the name of His glorious King.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark349"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark350"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Included in the general report of the Central European office is Austria, but in addition thereto we give the following separate excerpts from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of the poverty and the increasing unemployment in Austria, the distribution of literature has increased to the amount of 36,338 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of full-time pioneers has increased from 12 to 18 and, part of the year, 20 pioneers were active in the aerviee. Many of them work with great endurance and good success accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Six hundred and eighteen brethren partook of the Memorial, while about 400 have taken part in the weekly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, and 200 of these have participated regularly in the service. This number of regular workers has lately increased, and last month we counted 333 workers in the field} i.e., an increase of 133 workers, as compared with last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase of the distribution of literature during the year, as compared with the last year, was over 30 percent. During the year 26,983 books, 134,332 booklets and 18,206 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies were distributed. It is interesting to compare the number of workers who participated during the special service weeks. In the first, we counted 202; in the second, 279j and in the Surprise week, 313 brethren were in the field. During this special week 12,337 books and booklets were put in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we see how Jehovah has blessed his people in this country. They have shown great zeal and they appreciate the privilege of being Jehovah’s witnesses. The encouraging articles in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and the contents of the two books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> have helped much toward reaching the above results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our expectation to work with less difficulty this year was not fulfilled. In fact, the difficulties have increased; the authorities often arrest the brethren and impose, unlawfully, big fines to discourage them, but the brethren willingly suffer and gladly seize the opportunity of witnessing before the authorities. It is a joy to see their courage and their zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had no large convention, but a number of regional service conventions which encouraged the friends. The regional service directors are leading the brethren on in the active service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The exhibition of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Drama,</span><span class="font4"> followed by public lectures, was successful; and now, in the cities where the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Drama</span><span class="font4"> was shown, a number of persons have entered the ranks and ask to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We received 2,570 letters and dispatched 1,303. It is sheer joy to have a part in this work, and it is our desire to continue therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A translation of a newspaper article reporting an experience of the brethren in connection with the exhibition of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Drama </span><span class="font4">at Lienz, a Catholic city in Tyrol, Austria, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is reported that the Bible Students are carrying on very actively in Lienz and that the clergy are greatly disturbed, seeking to influence public opinion against the Bible Students. We have here an evidence that men like to see and hear that which is forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On Monday, the Cinema auditorium was packed before the opening of the show, and the entrances had to be guarded by the police. Many people had to go home without being admitted. The harmless </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Photo-Drama of Creation,</span><span class="font4"> with English titles, was shown, necessitating a translation or explanation by the speaker. The first part went off without disturbance. But during the second intermission, the county government official, Dr. Gasteiger, told the speaker that he must not say another word in explanation of the film. The speaker agreed to that and asked the official if he could not read a poem in closing, but even this was absolutely refused by Dr. Gasteiger. Then the speaker told the public about this interference, which greatly displeased them. Thereupon the apparently easily excited Dr. Gasteiger commanded the large number of policemen to have the hall vacated. The visitors left the hall reluctantly, expressing their indignation by whistling and by the use of the German word, ‘ Pf ui! ’ This excitement continued out on the street, and only by the intervention of the speaker and the ushers was it possible to keep the people from doing something foolish in their excitement. After the hall was vacated, a further detachment of police, which had been held in readiness, appeared with drawn bayonets, thereby causing another storm of resentment. The disturbance of the populace by such course of action was absolutely uncalled for. The authorities should have sent a more reasonable representative to this meeting, for, in his excitement, this young man might have incited dire results, if the police had not remained calm and carried out their orders with reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What is the local government going to do about such irresponsible actions? The county government should have known that the film had been censored for Tyrol and had been admitted and that, because the people of Lienz cannot read English, an interpretation was necessary. It will not do to use such sharp means against such harmless, unarmed visitors attending a meeting. Thus just the opposite result from that desired was obtained.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark351"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark352"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">An increased interest is shown in the kingdom message by the people of Belgium. Among other things the local manager’s report contains the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the year text has had its fulfilment in our midst. Jehovah has been our protection, and the angels in Zion in His name have blessed us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are now 56 brethren in Belgium, and of these 11 pioneers, 3 auxiliaries, 18 regular workers and 12 who work from time to time. The rest are inactive. The workers are divided into 6 small organized companies and one sharpshooter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we distributed 6,647 books, 65,219 booklets, 2,743 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies and 301 Bibles. That gives a total of 74,910 pieces of literature, as compared with 56,505 during the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service weeks increased our joy, and the workers everywhere appreciate these arrangements. The Surprise Week was begun with a service convention and closed with a service convention. All together, we had three such conventions, during which the anointed worked during the forenoon in the field, and in the afternoon they had a study on the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> which was received with enthusiasm. The brethren hope that they may soon have this book in the French language also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of our pioneers are English, some Polish, some Swiss, and some French. During this year a large part of Belgium was thoroughly served with the witness. The villages are far apart, and it becomes necessary to ride thirty or more miles a day with a bicycle. The &quot;religious merchants” are mad because the ‘ ‘ locusts ’ ’ have spoiled their land, and they advise the people to bum our books. Surely they were never so shaken as now. Their conduct is ridiculous. As soon as our pioneers enter a village, these hypocrites run to the police like scared rabbits. By this action some arrests were made, but as soon as the papers or passports of our pioneers are looked into, and when they are questioned about their work, they are generally let go at once. Often the police call down the clergy for their interference after they have heard the witness of the brethren, who carry a letter of introduction with the official signature of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some newspapers also felt called upon to slander the message and those who put the message out, but one journal said that the people should receive these witnesses kindly and buy their books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The majority of the pioneers do not know the language of the country. They work with a printed testimony card, which they show with a smile, and their success is wonderful. They have never lacked anything. For example: Some English pioneer brothers and Bisters in Belgium distributed individually as many as 30 books and 600 booklets during the last service week. One Polish brother in Belgium placed 70 books and 600 booklets in one week. This brother is now one year in the service in Belgium, and his total distribution during the year is 2,110 books and 10,338 booklets, in 1,594 hours of active service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the distribution of books in Belgium has been doubled and the distribution of booklets has also increased by two-thirds. Belgium is therefore good Boil, the people have been fearfully oppressed; but now deliverance is announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a time, we could give weekly radio lectures. We are confident that the work to the honor of the Creator will make further progress during the coming year. The political and the financial conditions of the country are such as to provoke discontent amongst the masses, and this condition is favorable to the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Closing our report, we express the desire of the Belgian brethren to give expression of their loyalty and sympathy to you, Brother Eutherford. The pioneers in Belgium, who were recently together, also wish to express their keen desire of continuing in the work in Belgium until they greet the returned Abraham at Brussels!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark353"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark354"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is with real joy and praise to the Lord that we note that France is awakening to her privilege of learning about the kingdom. The work in France has taken on a real impetus during the past twelve months. The convention held in Paris in May was a great stimulus to the work. The office of the Society at that time was moved to a more favorable position in the city, and the office workers were increased. It was necessary to house the workers in a comfortable place; therefore a house was purchased, where all the workers can live together, and therefore live much more economically. The local manager at Paris, reporting the conditions of the work in France, among other things says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in France lias surpassed our expectation, and we have evidence upon evidence that Jehovah’s time has come for a great witness to the French people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of these things were published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> at the time of the Columbus convention, but even since then the work has steadily gone forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RADIO: There are now three radio stations which regularly broadcast the Truth: Radio-Vitus in Paris, Radio Lyon, and Radio Normandy. All three stations broadcast regularly the transcription records of Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Vitus has built and completed a much stronger station outside of Paris. A new law regarding radio in Fiance soon goes into effect, and Mr. Vitus has informed us that he expects to operate his new station shortly. Then we hope to reach England and other European countries where heretofore the enemies of the Truth kept the Truth from going out by means of the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But even now thousands of people in Paris and its vicinity are hearing the message. Many of these have called at our office in Paris, which is now Centrally located, and have obtained the literature there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although Paris is a large city, our office has received letters Without any further address than “Watch Tower’’, “Bible Students,’’ “Deliverance,’’ or “Creation”; which goes to show that “Jehovah’s witnesses” in Paris are well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another evidence of the Lord’s interest in the work in Prance is the fact that a new home was bought for the workers and the pioneers. We thank you, Brother Rutherford, for providing this home. It has been fixed up to contain ten Tooms, and these are occupied by the nine brethren working in the Paris office and, in addition thereto, by four pioneers. Thus the house is fully occupied and the brethren there provided for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren still remember the wonderful convention at Paris, and particularly the addresses of Brother Rutherford to “Jehovah’s witnesses” at that time. The company workers were aroused to greater activity, and many decided at that time to enter the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PIONEERS WORKING IN FRANCE: We have now 104 regular pioneers in France. Many of them do not speak the French language, and yet the Lord has blessed them, and they are very successful in placing the books. For instance: A German pioneer, working in France during the last service week, placed 40 books and 532 booklets. Another placed 88 books and 272 booklets. An English sister placed 60 books and 543 booklets. A married couple, pioneers in France, during the year have placed 2,934 books and 16,643 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following extracts from letters received from pioneers in France show how the Lord blesses them: “We appreciate the privilege of being ‘les temoins de Jehovah’. The clergy here have had three conferences about us, at Evereux, at Rouen, and at Le Havre. One asked a pioneer the other day: ‘Are you several? Are you organized?’ We told him that we are the witnesses of Jehovah, and he backed into the house I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The big bound books still keep going out. Remember us to the dear brethren who are turning out the lovely clothbound books with pictures absolutely remarkable; honest hearts here have never seen anything like it, and they like the pictures!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Sunday afternoon a man came to our digs and wanted the whole set. I asked him if he had a Bible. Next morning he came before I was out of bed. As a matter of fact, I sold him my French Bible while in bed. When he had gone, I said: Well, that’s the limit, selling books in bed! Actually, not dreaming!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Then this morning, before we started out, a young lady came for 12 francs’ worth, one </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and one </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation. </span><span class="font4">This absolutely proves the Lord will bless us, if we only keep grinding at it.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another couple who have worked in France for a couple of years and who have even supported the Society financially because they left all they had, wrote recently: “The archbishop of Rouen has warned against us from the pulpit, and he has sent letters to the priests of his section, so that in all the villages the people say that the priests have told them that they should not buy these books. We are glad that the Haman class helps to separate the goats from the sheep and that the books thus get into the hands of those who think for themselves and who see the hypocrisy in the church. In nearly every village the mayor has obtained one or more books. In one village the mayor bought also a Bible, and when the brother brought it to him, he said: ‘You can tell the people that I recommend these books and that I have bought them.’ In that town we had placed many, even before we met the mayor, but soon after we were told that the priest had said to the people they should burn the books because these are ‘ hoaxes ’. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ACTIVITY: While there have been about 23 cases where the clergy thought to influence the authorities against our workers, all were settled in our favor; and we can well say that France is the only country in Europe where the Truth can be spread without great difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are about 700 active workers in France, including the pioneers. These have spent 150,804 hours in the service during the year and have thereby placed 2,321 Bibles, 79,560 books, 571,766 booklets, and 83,850 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies, and have obtained 990 new subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In France we have 40 Polish companies, with about 670 brethren, and 10 French companies, with about 170 brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aside from this, there are some German classes in Alsace and in the Saar Basin, which is also under the jurisdiction of France. The brother from the Saar Basin writes: “We have four classes which are organized for the service, with an attendance of 185 brethren, and 100 of these take part in the service. Last December, the Government, upon our request from this office, published a notice instructing the police not to interfere with our workers. They have obeyed the instructions, but the clergy have become all the more furious. They warn against us each Sunday from the pulpit. In one village they even caused the half-grown-ups to throw stones at the witnesses of Jehovah. We even had to apply to the police for protection. Some in the country districts still listen to the clergy, but in the centers of industry, where the people have lost faith in the priests, the opposition has decreased and the people hear us gladly. ’ ’ The brethren themselves realize that the time has come when we must spend more time for the service of the Lord and where we must continue to work in one spirit, and thus the Lord’s blessing will not fail us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOLLAND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark355"></a><span class="font5">Holland is a small country, and slow. Some of the brethren there, however, are enthusiastic for the Lord and his cause. More workers have gone into Holland, and the work is taking on a greater impetus. From the local manager’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enthusiasm of the workers here reached a high point following the international convention at Columbus. We are not able to tell you how happy we are for the things the Lord gave his witnesses on the occasion of this convention through his earthly representatives. With high expectation we await the publication of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The economic condition in Holland is growing worse. Thousands are without employment, and the burdens of the people are becoming heavier every day. The Queen recently gave a throne speech which reflected the bad conditions prevailing throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In five of the 11 provinces we have companies to a total number of 11. All of these are organized. There are about 100 brethren who attend the company meetings, including 12 pioneers, but we can count on only 60 regular company workers. Others continue to ‘sit in their ceiled houses’, when they could give all their time to the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eight of the twelve pioneers are German, and they are working with printed testimony cards. About 70 regular workers spent together 8,976 hours, placing 2,465 books, 38,167 booklets, and distributing 171 G~&lt;4. copies during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the pioneers have recently entered the service, and therefore we expect a great increase of the work in Holland. A regional service director sent from this office also helped to arouse the Dutch brethren to see their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Dutch brethren also participated in the five service weeks, and they are getting a better general view of the work being done in the whole earth. Day and night the witness is being given, and to the song of praise to the Almighty God there is no end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are happy and thankful to the Lord because he has heard our prayer and has sent more workers into the field. Eor the future, we are very hopeful, knowing and seeing how the Lord is leading us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark356"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark357"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Two years ago the Society’s literature was confiscated by the government of Italy, but now that order is reversed and certain of the Society’s publications may be circulated. Two pioneers are in the field for service, and work is beginning. Three hundred and nineteen books and 1,393 booklets were recently put out. It is hoped we may have a better report next year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark358"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark359"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This land for many years has been priest-ridden, and it is still under the dominance of the Catholic system. For various reasons it was deemed best to move the office of the Society from Warsaw to Lodz. At the present time there are 60 organized companies and 30 small groups which are lifting up the standard of the Lord. About 500 brethren regularly participate in the field service. There are 55 pioneers and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font5">auxiliary workers in the field. The local manager says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a decrease in the distribution for the following reasons: Two companies were disbanded by government order; in several places literature was confiscated, and the distress of the people is ever increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of these hindrances, about 500 brethren have regularly engaged in the service and have distributed 14,686 books, 139,611 booklets, 46,794 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies and 986 Bibles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work has been put on a better basis. The brethren took part in the four special service weeks, which shows that more brethren realize the great importance of the witness work, and that all wish to belong to “Jehovah’s witnesses’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the spring we had a general convention at Lodz. Seventy companies sent their delegates, and the difficult job of getting the Society registered in Poland was there begun. The Catholic clergy are doing everything possible to keep the Society from being registered; but we hope to succeed in spite of them, and then the success of Jehovah’s witnesses in this country will increase considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had four regional service directors in the service; one of them with other pioneers was accused of communism. The bishop of Sandomierz succeeded in influencing the judge, who kept this brother in jail three months. However, the witnesses of the clergy have contradicted each other, and the charges cannot be upheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two hundred fifty-one public meetings, with 23,054 visitors, were held. Eight thousand nine hundred and eleven pieces of mail were received, and 6,008 were dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hunger for the Truth is increasing, and the people generally receive the kingdom message gladly. The controversy between the national Polish and the Boman Catholic church often prepares the soil, and the people see that only the Truth can satisfy, by giving a reason for the present distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing that the clergy could not put all of Jehovah’s witnesses into jail, they have now thought to keep our literature out by raising the tariff, at least it seems as though the clergy had something to do with it. But we have found another way to overcome even this difficulty. We believe it is Jehovah’s will to continue the witness work in Poland, and therefore we look confidently into the future.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark360"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark361"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s office is at Maribor, and in that benighted country of Yugoslavia the Lord is sending his message of truth that the message may be given to the rulers and to the people. The few of Jehovah’s witnesses there are diligent. The government has decided that the Society’s literature may be distributed without a license. The king of Yugoslavia has received the witness of the truth and has the books. One of the founders of the Yugoslavian government has now become a fully consecrated brother in the Lord, and attended the Paris convention. There are only 91 brethren in the country now who are consecrated, 40 of whom arc engaged in the service. Sixty-two symbolized their consecration during the year. These workers distributed 1,968 books and 10,773 booklets. They had five service conventions, during which they placed 450 books and 2,796 booklets. The work is carried on in the German, Slovenian, and Croatian languages. The local manager reports that a year ago the Lord’s people were in disrepute and despised, but now public lectures are held with an attendance of as many as a thousand persons.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark362"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark363"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country is dominated by the priests or clergy of the enemy’s organization. The truth cannot be proclaimed openly. The brethren are always in danger of going to jail, and yet they continue in the service. Frequently a service director is kept in jail for several days, and secret service men often attend the meetings to find something against Jehovah’s witnesses. The Society has an office in Bucharest, however, and the work is being organized in a new way. There are about 2,000 brethren in Rumania, and these under great difficulties have distributed during the year 5,549 books and 39,811 booklets.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark364"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark365"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The country of Switzerland is small in area, and it contains some zealous witnesses for Jehovah. There has been a thorough witness made throughout the land, and this has greatly aroused the wrath of the Devil. The local manager says: ‘ ‘ Everything has been done to put more difficulties in our way. Recently the Supreme Court reversed a former favorable decision to us, and now decided against our literature. This was due to the influence of the clergy. ” Further his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This case was brought on because of the distribution of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> in the Catholic canton of Fribourg. Regardless of the fact that the Constitution of Switzerland is based upon liberty of faith and conscience, the Society and its representatives stand condemned as blasphemers against God before the Supreme Court of Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our lawyer and another famous teacher of law, Prof. Dr. Fleiner of the University of Zurich, and other men of authority, had claimed that we could not be condemned according to the proper interpretation of the Swiss law. Moreover, the first page of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font4"> on account of which we are condemned as blasphemers, contains in large letters the following words: “As a Testimony to the Name of the Almighty God, the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth, this book is dedicated.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another verdict of the same court was rendered, which said that the distribution of our books on Sunday and the acceptance of free gifts for our unselfish work is like a bookselling business and for this we must obtain a special license.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some cantonal authorities thereupon forbade the further distribution of our literature. The hypocrisy of this procedure lies in this, that some cantons thereupon have a better chance to refuse a license, even if we should ask for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One canton, the canton of Lucerne, particularly gave order that we must not distribute the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> on account of a certain picture therein. The letter addressed to us described the picture in detail, and Baid that the picture indicated that they are a part of Satan’s organization. Doubtless the Devil expected that Jehovah’s witnesses would be discouraged; but the opposite was the case, for more books than ever were put into the hands of the people in Switzerland this year, to wit: 51,431 books, 142,556 booklets, 70,376 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> copies, 63 Bibles, and 1,006 new subscribers made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 20,000 more books were distributed than last year. In Bpite of the greater difficulties in the distribution, the brethren have shown a wonderful zeal, courage and persistence in the service. The Lord has blessed richly the determination to obey God rather than men. About 20 cases are pending in court. We have entered a strong protest, addressed to the cantonal government at Zurich. Some of our friends, government officials, have already voiced the injustice done to us in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the battle of God Almighty Switzerland will surely receive recompense, for she has resisted the Truth and has raised false accusations and rendered false witness regarding Jehovah’s representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year we had 12 public meetings, with an attendance of 2,510 people; 488 company meetings, with an attendance of 8,366; and 10 regional service conventions with an attendance of 1,380.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alsace-Lorraine and the Saar Basin are under the jurisdiction of the Swiss office, and the work there is included within the report of the Central European office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark366"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark367"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Although economic conditions in Germany continue to grow worse, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to push forward in the work. There is great distress amongst the people. Upward of five million men, together with their dependent ones, are without employment. This prevents many people from being able to get the literature; yet many of them are making sacrifices to try to inform themselves as to why these conditions exist. Jehovah’s witnesses are rejoicing in the privilege to explain to the people concerning God’s kingdom now at hand, which will bring complete relief. The service workers in the field in Germany during the year were slightly above 10,000. The number of organized companies increased by 80. The number of bound books placed in Germany was somewhat less than that of last year, but the booklets distributed is a decided increase, making the total more for the year. The aggregate number of books and booklets placed by the German company of the Lord’s organization for the fiscal year is, to wit: 5,600,435. The local manager has this to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Compared with the year before, that means an increase of 1,389,378 pieces of literature. If six booklets are set equal to one book, the number for the foregoing year was 1,730,724, and for the year now ended, 1,874,281. That is an increase of 143,557.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Especially remarkable with this year’s Annual Report is the number of hours spent in the kingdom work, as shown in the following list:</span></p>
<table border="1">

<p><span class="font4">1,343,392</span></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p><span class="font4">Number of testimonies given has not been counted during the whole year. When giving the total number of these, that is, partly received by estimation, it is: Number of testimonies, 10,200,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the total number of pieces of literature distributed is compared with the number of families in Germany, the result is as follows: Literature distributed the year now past: five million and a half. Total number of families in Germany is about 15,000,000. That means that the distribution is better than one piece of literature to every third family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PIONEERS: The number of pioneers, too, increased considerably during this fiscal year. It is now 315, against 170 by the end of the foregoing year; that is an increase of 145. The number of auxiliary pioneers increased from 50 to 120. In spite of heavy difficulties which they had to overcome, the pioneers went on joyfully, and efforts were made to reach isolated districts which formerly did not hear much of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The figures of literature spread by pioneers are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Number of pioneers</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">DRAMA OF CREATION: There is no opportunity in Germany to reach the public by radio. The only means to do this is therefore </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and the Drama of Creation. Jehovah richly blessed this part of the work, as may be seen from the following items. (Report for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> see below.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the Drama of Creation (Photo-Drama) it is to be said that from the former Photo-Drama there is no more left than the name and the use of the transparent pictures, etc. The text for it is now taken from the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> and others, and the name “Drama of Creation’’ is based upon the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were performances in 164 towns, total number of attendants amounting to 298,300. The number of books placed on these occasions is 16,567, and number of booklets 60,157; and 20,722 persons attending the performance gave their address, thereby expressing their desire to hear more about the message. It makes one happy to see that 341 of these already joined the workers in the service of Jehovah. It is to be expected that there will be still others to cooperate. Particularly in Catholic districts the performances worked much good; and it is in this way that 95 new companies were founded, which have a total number of attendants of about 4,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GOLDEN AGE: There was a considerable increase in this branch of the service during the year now past, that being further evidenced by the fact that an always increasing number of people are desirous of being in constant touch with the truth. The number of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font4">increased from 345,000 to 420,000; that means, by 75,000. The number of distributed copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> increased from 8.6 to 9.9 millions. If we count only three readers to every </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> that means that nearly 1} million people in Germany are now reached with the truth regularly by the radio lectures published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SERVICE WEEKS: Several special weeks have been set aside during the year, known as ‘ ‘ service weeks ’ ’, in which the friends, joined with their brethren upon all the earth, made extraordinary efforts to get the kingdom message in the hands of the people. A survey of these weeks follows;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Special blessing of the Lord was upon these weeks, and the friends were greatly encouraged thereby in their efforts to have a part in vindicating Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">BETHEL FAMILY: Besides the work in the factory and the office, the Bethel family had a part in spreading the message from house to house. Following the course of action observed by the Brooklyn family, the factory and the office have been closed for several days in four of the service weeks mentioned, and the family participated further in the service from house to house on every Sunday. In this activity 42,000 books and 165,000 booklets have been spread, together more than 200,000 pieces of literature. On several occasions districts were witnessed to which were strictly Catholic, where strong opposition of the clergy has been met and the people were found in deep darkness; and therefore the total of the results is splendid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides that, a regular visit of six brethren of the family to companies within a radius of 400 kilometers was upheld by drives with automobile, and the friends were much encouraged by this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CONVENTIONS: One large convention has been held during the year, when the president of the Society spent a visit to Germany, and it was spurring the friends greatly. The number of friends present on the main day of the convention was 10,000. A good part of the time was spent in the field service, and 146,505 books and booklets were spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Surprise Week nine conventions in extension of the Columbus convention were held, and then 14,325 books and 94,348 booklets were spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society arranged for regular week-end meetings, and on these occasions a good part </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the time was spent in the field, and regional service directors, as well as partly members of the Bethel family, were present. This contributed to the encouragement of the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">OPPOSITION: The progress of the work, of course, aroused the wrath of the enemy and he tried everything he could to stop the friends in their activity. During the year 1,017 lawsuits were brought to a decision, 980 of which ended with a verdict of “Not guilty’’ and 37 with condemnation. New legal actions brought on numbered 916. By the end of this fiscal year 538 lawsuits are pending. But all these things did not turn out to the friends’ discouragement; they are going onward, more firmly decided to press the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">FACTORY AND BETHEL HOME: During the year the new building was finished and occupied, this being to the welfare of the Bethel family. There are 76 rooms for two persons each in this building; further, dining room, reading, writing and music rooms. Living now in better rooms, the brethren are more able to perform a good work. Besides this building, we now have a large garden in which vegetables for the family are grown, and so we now produce the major part of the vegetables for ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A considerable increase can be found also for the factory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">These totals of production being compared with those of the foregoing year, there is found an increase of 3,116,176 booklets and of 1,242,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It is to be seen from that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">survey that the year 1931 has</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">been by far the best we have ever had in the service of the kingdom. To Jehovah belongs all the honor for that, he granting wonderfully his blessing and his strength to his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark368"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark369"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The German office at Magdeburg exercises jurisdiction over the work in Czechoslovakia. During the year the number of pioneers increased to 32. There was an increase in the distribution of the books of approximately 50 percent, and booklets of about 40 percent, over the previous year. Economic conditions are very bad in this land, but the interest in the truth increases. The police in different parts, such as Bohemia and Moravia, have interfered, but the work moves steadfastly on. In Slovakia and some other points the brethren were much hindered. The German brethren in Czechoslovakia were zealous. Seventeen German brethren went over from Germany and engaged in the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Books distributed during the year total 75,430, and booklets 151,155, and 87,050 tracts were distributed. There are 42 companies and 562 company workers in the field. There are 32 pioneers, and 14 auxiliaries and 7 regional service directors. Work in that land is done amongst the Hungarian people, the Slovaks, Russians, Germans and others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark370"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark371"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In Hungary there is great opposition to the truth. Most of the consecrated live in the rural districts, and they are greatly restricted in their activities. They are under police observation all the time, and the police are directed by the clergy. These lay hold on the slightest excuse to cause the punishment of the brethren. Those few that live in the larger towns are permitted to act without such close surveillance. The Society has a depot at Budapest, and the combined efforts of the brethren have resulted in placing with the people a goodly number of books and booklets. The only regional service director that has served in Hungary during the year, Brother Kiss, was imprisoned on several occasions, and on a recent journey through the land he has disappeared, leaving no trace of him. In spite of the cruel persecution that is carried on against the Lord’s witnesses by the clergy and their political tools, the brethren have courageously carried the banner of truth forward as best they could. During the year they have placed in the hands of the people 2,551 books and 3,511 booklets, and distributed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 17,016 copies, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 696.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark372"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark373"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is entirely a Catholic priest-ridden country, and these men make it their business to prod the police and keep them looking out for Jehovah’s witnesses. Two pioneers have been sent into that small land, and are pushing forward as best they can to give the testimony. They have put out 2,610 books and 4,993 booklets, and distributed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 3,892.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark374"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark375"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Like other parts of the world, there is much distress and perplexity in Greece, a great amount of unemployment, scarcity of money, and added to this is bitter opposition to the spreading of the truth. The elergy have busied themselves time and again to cause the arrest of Jehovah’s witnesses and the confiscation of the literature. They have done everything within their power to stamp out the truth, but they have not succeeded. The output of books and booklets during the year has aggregated 55,236. There were two regional service directors visiting the classes. These held 251 meetings, with an attendance of 4,273. Ten pioneers are in the field, and the brethren are battling valiantly on against the enemy, singing the praises of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark376"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark377"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in India has not progressed to any great extent during the year, but still considerable interest is shown. The total number of books placed in the hands of the people was, to wit, 43,778. Recently other workers have been sent out from England. The field is vast, and few to do the work. They are working on as best they can.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark378"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark379"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year the Society purchased a home for the Jamaican workers, and which also is large enough to accommodate the local company in Kingston for their regular meetings. During the year the witnesses there have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 24,061. There are three regional service directors, 28 pioneers, 44 auxiliaries, and 250 service workers in the field. The local manager in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have the greatest pleasure in sending you the report of the Jamaica Branch for the year that is now ended. It has been one of continuous activity by Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica, in spite of the financial depression which has caused about two-thirds of our pioneers to suspend continuous service; but one thing noticeable is that all the brethren take some part in the service work on Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It affords us great joy as Jehovah’s witnesses to serve him intelligently and to walk in the light as it shines on us from the temple through the various helps provided for the remnant at this time. The Lord has graciously supplied us with spiritual food abundantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The articles on “Esther and Mordecai”, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet have all filled us to overflowing. We shall endeavor to be more active in going forth to Bet the mark as Jehovah’s witnesses, as is pointed out by the above-mentioned publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to the financial depression which exists over the entire island, our output of books and booklets is much lower than what we expected, but this was made up by the many opportunities for witnessing to the public. More than 100 public lectures were delivered to approximately 20,000 hearers, resulting in the establishment of a few new classes for the study of God’s Word. Every one of these interested ones manifests the spirit of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Columbus (Ohio) convention has greatly energized us, and we have been able through the president’s circular to all Branch managers to stir up the brethren to more active service by appointing two more regional service directors to visit the companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Much is left to be done, and we are seeking in every way to cooperate with the Society as Jehovah’s true and faithful witnesses to do what is required of us, and our new name has been a great impetus to this end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since we have acquired our spacious and permanent quarters, both for the office and the Kingston company, we find that the public give better attention to the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have once more the pleasure of expressing our heartfelt gratitude for the loving ministry of our beloved president and his coworkers and our determination to be more energetic in pressing the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark380"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark381"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work is not great in Japan, but it has steadily increased during the year. There are seven workers in the Bethel family, 65 pioneers, and 12 other class workers who engage in the service, and one regional service director. The following excerpt is taken from the local manager’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord still continues to bless his witnesses in Japan. I am so happy to send another annual report to you. The result is the best since the Lord opened his work in Japan in 1927. Japan is in quite bad condition financially and socially. The government is nearly bankrupted. Anarcliists and communists are very active in every direction. Many more banks and stores are closed every day. All religious systems, both Churchianity and Buddhists, and others, are at the point of bankruptcy, because people left them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this condition the witnessing work for the name of the Lord is progressing very healthfully. We cannot use the radio in Japan for the witness work. But the Lord uses Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> freely for his work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is very popular among the people now. The result of the activities in Japan during the last year are as follows (from September 25, 1930, to September 24, 1931) :</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Every service week was faithfully observed by the Japanese brethren according to the announcement by Brooklyn head office. The Haman class is very mad at Jehovah’s witnesses, but is entirely helpless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Japanese government keeps its sharp, watchful eyes on us very closely. But Jehovah’s witnesses go forth just the same. Many chiefs of police obtained sets of books from our pioneers with a great interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark382"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark383"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people in Korea are very poor, and it is difficult for them to afford literature; yet the work still progresses and there is much opportunity for personal testimony as well as placing with the people some books and booklets. During the year books placed with the people were 2,753, and booklets 13,136; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age’s</span><span class="font5"> distributed, 3,940. There are 10 pioneers in Korea in the service. During the year they visited 30,920 houses, devoting 11,853 hours to the service, with the above results.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark384"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark385"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Mexican branch maintained at the city of Mexico is making progress in the work. There are 10 sharpshooters and 49 company workers, 10 auxiliaries and 13 pioneers in the field. During the year they placed 11,219 books and 19,479 booklets, making a total of 30,698. We expect to begin the publication shortly of a journal in the Spanish language, especially for Mexico and the South American countries. This magazine will be entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light and Truth,</span><span class="font5"> and published and sent out from the Brooklyn office to the various Latin-speaking people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark386"></a><span class="font5">The Northern Europeon office of the Society, maintained at Copenhagen, Denmark, under the supervision of one general manager, exercises jurisdiction over the following countries, to wit: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania. It is gratifying to report that the work in these countries during the year as a whole has progressed in a very pleasing manner. The brethren are very zealous and actively engage in the work in the field. The report of the manager of the Northern European office, amongst other things, states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The echoes of Columbus convention are still being heard throughout Northern Europe as in conventions and companies the new name, with all its solemn implications, is being joyfully adopted. At Helsingfors convention the brethren were so enthused after its adoption that, despite the hard times, 2,980 books and booklets were placed by the 322 who sallied forth. It would seem that Columbus convention, coming after the discernment of the “man of sin”, was a red-letter day in the church's history, and indeed the most important happening since Christ, as the representative of Jehovah, came to his temple. According to promise Jehovah gave his people “another name” and a veritable flood of light upon their pathway. Keeping step with their brethren the world over, 1,329 in Northern Europe delivered 50,000 testimonies and spread 35,217 pieces of literature during the Columbus convention and its extensions. A spirit of holy joy pervaded our gatherings here and, when they came to hand, the reports in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> were very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year a determined effort has been made to reach the outlying portions of our extended front, and the English pioneers you sent over during your European visit have been doing good work. Two went to Norway, two to Esthonia, and three to Lithuania. Ours was the first house trailer ever seen in Norway, and it attracts quite a deal of attention and has proven very useful for the pioneers working towards the Swedish border. One lady asked them: &quot;But at what hotel do you put up?’’ &quot;Oh,” they replied, &quot;our hotel moves along with us on wheels.” Soon we hope to secure the boat you have authorized, so that the people who live on the long fjords may also get the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Lithuania the brethren were ordered to leave the country but, saying nothing about that, we applied afresh to one of the &quot;higher-ups”, who gave them the requisite permission to stay and work. It was to us a clear evidence that the angels in Zion were busy in our behalf. Doubtless the fact that the papacy and the government are at loggerheads prepared the way for the happy result. It is a difficult job to get the witness given in Lithuania, but it goes out all the same. Nothing can stop us any more. It was grand to read in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Earp</span><span class="font4"> and the booklets can now be spread in Italy while the pope and Mussolini fight each other!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In every land here money gets more scarce; so it is a real joy to be able to report that, notwithstanding the increasing stringency, 128,310 books and 545,538 booklets, a total of 673,848, were sent out from the offices, while 129,111 books and 551,825 booklets, a total of 680,936, were actually placed among the 21 millions of Northern Europe. These were spread by 859 brethren out each week, and were in no less than fifteen different languages. We are down in books, as last year we placed 155,783; but then our booklets were only 483,985. The reason for the fall in books is that last May the 10,000 sets of six books by Pastor Bussell, ordered for Norway and Denmark, were exhausted. They went out in two years. This has taught us how needful a plentiful supply of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ammnni</span><span class="font4">tion is; and so, particularly in Scandinavia and F</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inla</span><span class="font4">nd, we are bending every effort towards getting the new books translated and printed by September, next year. It will be grand to have eleven bound books. By October 30 the two books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> will be in all four countries, and they will surely prove a great stimulus to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year a weekly average of 151 pioneers and auxiliaries spread 291,210, as against 292,693 by 149 last year. Considering the harder times in which we now live, these figures are wonderfully encouraging. They represent much hard work and many hardships cheerfully borne that the glad news of the kingdom might go forth. We praise the Lord for these dear brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RADIO: At Tallinn, instead of English with translation to another language for half an hour, we have now a whole hour, and lectures are given each week in Esthonian, Russian, Finnish and Swedish. In this way a far wider witness to the truth is possible. The last three lectures are sent by wire from Helsingfors office to the station in Tallinn and then broadcast. The time is now 5: 30 to 6: 30 p.m. each Sunday (or 3: 30 to 4:30 English time), and just now the station has secured a more favorable wave length of 441 meters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well heard in all Finland and by a population of 1,500,000 in Sweden, and doubtless by many in Russia also, though we have had little direct evidence from that land. At times, however, Tallinn station has been heard as far off as Odessa on the one side and America on the other. We are glad of your authority to fix up the contract for an hour and of the funds given us from headquarters to pay therefor. From time to time we hammer for admission at the doors of other stations, and doubtless we shall have a joyful surprise in the Lord’s due time. It was so in Tallinn, where we were refused time and again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE GOLDEN AGE: Here on balance the number of subscribers has increased by 4,500, to 46,900. We have editions in Norwegian, Swedish, Danish and Finnish, as well as getting some German subscribers in the Baltic States. Without doubt this magazine has been instrumental in arousing a good deal of interest in the truth. The advertisements of the books also helps their spread, for on several occasions 250 to 300 bound books have been written in for to the various offices as a result of one insertion. As the trouble in the world deepens, people look to see what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say about it, and, as we go round, many express their pleasure in the magazine and take some of the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though in the past six years over 4} </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">milli</span><span class="font4">ons of books and booklets have been spread, they still, of course, continue to go out well and the brethren were never in so good spiritual health as now. All over the Bethel families and the brethren rejoice in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies. Now and again, it is true, one or another falls to the seductions of the Devil, but the remnant stands fast. As the world staggers to and fro like a drunken man they abide under the shadow of the Almighty. They say of Jehovah, “He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.” We are thankful, too, for all the help and admonition contained in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4"> and for the sinews of war supplied from headquarters. It is grand to see our work so clearly outlined in Ezekiel, as opened up for us in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.</span><span class="font4"> The brethren in all Northern Europe send you their love and hope you will be able to come over here next year, so that you may receive it in person.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark387"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark388"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This country is embraced in the report of the Northern European office, but from the local manager’s report the following excerpt is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At our year-convention (August 29-September 1), in Oslo we all arose on our feet and with great enthusiasm shouted “Ja”, when adopting our new name “Jehovah’s witnesses”. The convention was the best ever held in Norway. Seventy went out twice and spread 1,100 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the many years of economic difficulties there has this year been added a six-months-long lockout and strike, about the longest time in the whole world. On account of the great financial shaking in Germany and England, Norway has just great difficulties and had to cut off their gold standard. The prices will after this be higher, of course. We feel Armageddon is drawing near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The few friends have done a good work under the difficult circumstances we have had in Norway. We have sent out from the office a total of 74,344 books and booklets, 17,781 free copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> tracts and folders, 4,020 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins</span><span class="font4"> and 2,934 letters. One hundred eighty-seven friends have been in the service work, and 10 pioneers. Average number out each week, 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> has 3,532 subscribers, and 9,176 single copies have been sold. First of October we expect to have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> in our language, and the friends are very much longing for it. All of us reading English are now studying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> with great enthusiasm, at our Bethel home on Monday night, according to the suggestion in your encouraging letter to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has also been an adventure to read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> and see how Jehovah’s organization is going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Norwegian friends are very pleased and thankful for your permission to get a new boat. We are just looking around in Norway to get one most suitable for us. It is difficult to find a good one at a cheap price.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark389"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark390"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Our Swedish brethren continue with zeal and earnestness to proclaim the message of the kingdom. This country is also embraced within the Northern European district, but from the local manager in Sweden who makes report we quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And, as you will find, the output and actual placement figures are up on last year’s, in spite of the fact that money is getting tighter and tighter in this country as in all others. The total output of books and booklets is 221,343, against 191,753 in 1929-30. The total of books and booklets actually placed with the public, 228,307, against 187,518. During the year </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font4"> came out in Swedish and has proven a rapidplacing one. And we expect it to do still better now, when all people have got to feel the need of a stable and perfect government still more, through the effects of the financial crisis. Of the older books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> takes the lead. More and more people want to know if there is a Creator they may put their trust in and if it is true that “the old Book” is really a trustworthy revelation of his purposes toward ma</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nkin</span><span class="font4">d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the pioneer division of the Lord’s army of witnesses in this country there has been during the year an average of 38 each month as whole-timers, and 17 auxiliaries. The number of whole-timers has gone up from 27 last year, and we expect still more to enter this blessed service with the beginning of the new year. The number of books and booklets placed by pioneers is 124,662, besides 4,133 subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and 28,511 loose copies. The Society’s motorcar has been used during this summer for witnessing in some parts of western Sweden, along the Norwegian border, and the results have been very gratifying. The two brethren have traveled during five months 8,876 kilometers and placed 1,353 bound books and 4,075 booklets and copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of companies organized for the witness work is 56 in all. But the number of permit holders is up to 512, and the average number out week by week has increased from 209 to 226. The Lord is making his people more and more alive to their privileges and to make use of them. The companies have placed a total of 88,116 books and booklets, plus 7,538 subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and 30,254 loose copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to have the regional director service still more effective, we have started during the year now passed to let these brethren have a certain district each and go round to all companies in Sweden before coming back to a certain company. And this system has proven very beneficial to the work. The number of public meetings is less than last year, more and more time being put in doing house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> readers are beco</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font4">g more and more appreciative of the wonderful light and guidance received through its columns. Surely, the wayfaring man need not err in the way, now so easily discerned and marked out for the “ransomed of the Lord”. And I cannot refrain from using this opportunity to voice our thankfulness to the instrument, The Watch Tower Society, and you personally, used to do mightily by the Father and our </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">g in behalf of His anointed witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> also shows an increase this year, although the money scarceness has made itself felt in this department, too, the number of subscriptions having increased only by 746, to 18,769, whereas the number of loose copies distributed has increased by more than 15,000. We are getting many questions sent in from the readers of this magazine, which show that they are studying the truth and grasping and appreciating quite a bit of it. No doubt many of the readers of this magazine are being prepared to take their stand on the side of the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An interesting item, one that can be reported for the first time in this annual report, is the number of testimonies delivered. We started to count the testimonies with the beginning of May, and since then there has been given a total of 151,886 testimonies, which means that 1/40 of the population has had a direct testimony. The number of hours worked during the year is 86,056 of direct witnessing, plus 21,682 going and coming back. In some places it takes a long time to get to the territory, especially in the north, which is a very sparsely populated district. It is indeed touching to learn how weak and feeble women walk on their feet many, many miles and sometimes through roadless woods, carrying heavy bags with books, to find some isolated little village and bring the message of hope and comfort and good cheer to the people living there under very difficult conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to the prospects for the incoming year, we are looking forward to the campaign with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet in due time. The manuscript for this booklet in Swedish has been sent to the Berne office. Another of the booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes and Calamities,</span><span class="font4"> is being prepared at Berne, and we are waiting for it with some eagerness, seeing that we have had no new booklet in Swedish since </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">War or Peace</span><span class="font4"> came, last autumn. We do not deplore the delay, as we know it has been caused by the necessity of preparing weapons for our brethren in the firing line in France; but nevertheless we are glad to get some fresh ammunition in our country too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new year will start by the companies’ adopting the Columbus resolution. Copies of the resolution and letters advising the companies to have it read and proposed for adoption went out a day or two ago. We feel sure this will prove a great blessing and help in the work, and an incentive to continued faithfulness. ‘ ‘ The Lord has given the word, ’ ’ and the army of witnesses in Sweden, though not great in number, will certainly do its duty and with delight publish and make known that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is here and is the only hope of the world, and give the warning now due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We thank Him for this great privilege and join the psalmist in his exhortation: “Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! ’ ’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark391"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark392"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The report from Denmark is gratifying, and it is very well covered in the following extracts from the local manager’s report to this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A glorious year in the service of Jehovah and his King has come to an end. It opened with great enthusiasm, and it ended with even greater. It has been a year of ever increasing joy, and we are only wondering, What will come next!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have just had our annual meeting of the company of Jehovah’s witnesses here in Copenhagen, and at this meeting we unanimously adopted the new name Jehovah himself has given his people, and we did it with a loud and mighty ‘ ‘ Aye I ’ ’ from the bottom of our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only a short time before, September 6-15, we had a real fine united effort in the Witness Week. In that one week the small Danish company of 400 witnesses for Jehovah spread no less than 21,524 books and booklets. It was very encouraging to us all; but let me remind you, dear Brother Rutherford, that in 1927 we even exceeded this splendid total by placing 25,177 books and booklets, and that was when you were here the last time and gave us a mighty send-off. We have never since been able to achieve such exploits; so please come over soon and help us do it again!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The best result in the Witness Week was obtained, of course, by the Copenhagen company, as it is by far the biggest company and the biggest town in Denmark and, in fact, in the whole of Northern Europe. The figures are: 134 out, 9,127 testimonies, 1,294 books, 6,923 booklets, 40 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> subs and 522 copies; total 8,779. But another outstanding result is also worth mentioning; namely, for the Bonne company of Jehovah’s witnesses, three in all, the figures here are: 3 out, testimonies 851, books 77, booklets 887, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> subs 8 and 21 copies; total 993.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever you have a special campaign in America, we have it here also, and rejoice in it. We are happy in recognizing that we are not standing alone, but belong to that body of anointed witnesses whom the Lord has raised up, like Esther, to their honored position, to give them an opportunity to prove their fidelity and integrity by unreservedly taking their stand on Jehovah’s side. Some few have left us during the year, but others have taken their place and are eagerly listening to the advice of Mordecai; so all the friends are getting more and more united as one man and are glad to follow the instructions they receive through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span><span class="font4"> We have, however, this year had one extra campaign in April, the Comfort Week. Our stock of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort</span><span class="font4"> booklets was about 17,000 and would not get less, as the friends were all the time using the new booklets. Then we arranged for this special week and spread more than 15,000, besides quite a few other books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the big events of the year was the Columbus (or International) Convention Week. As you know, we had seven extension conventions here in Denmark, and we called them all Columbus-Conventions. A special blessing rested over these extension service conventions, and it was a lasting blessing which is still making itself felt in our work in a marked degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you will notice from the annexed report, the figures are very much the same as last year (in spite of the fact that the report for Iceland is not included this year); in some cases the figures are a little less, but in others there is an increase. The number of books and booklets sent out from the office and the number spread are almost the same, 121,419 out and 120,712 placed. Another item of interest is that over 200,000 testimonies have been given in the year, or one for every fourth family of Denmark’s 3J millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The MS. for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet was sent to Berne long ago, and the grand book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> is nearly translated; so we have a fine and great time ahead of us, and the friends are full of joyful expectation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now just at the closing of the fiscal year and the beginning of a new year of service comes your inspiring letter of September 1, asking the Bethel families everywhere to unite in serious and zealous study of the fulfilment of the prophecies in Jehovah’s Word. Small as this event might seem to be, I am sure that later it will be seen to be of the greatest importance in the history of the remnant. We are one people, and a blessed people I</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark393"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark394"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Even in the bleak country of Iceland there is some work being done to give a testimony to Jehovah’s name. There is now a pioneer in that land, sent there by the Society, and who is doing good work. The population is only just above a hundred thousand. One thousand four hundred and ninety-nine copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font5"> and 3,237 booklets were placed in the hands of the people during the year. This pioneer attended the Paris convention and there related how it was necessary for him to get a supply of books and go by horseback over the mountains. Other literature is being prepared in the Icelandic language, the printing of which is done at the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark395"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark396"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The zealous brethren of Finland continue with energy the work that the Lord has given them to do there. This country is embraced within the Northern European office report, but in addition thereto we quote from the local manager’s report from Finland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year was begun with the erection of our own printing plant, which has especially been used for printing of our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, Golden Age, Bulletin,</span><span class="font4"> posters, folders, report sheets, etc. The erection of the plant took time, about two months, and it was very interesting to see how quickly our brothers learned to use it. Certainly the Lord made them skilled to do the work which he desired to have done. We have had the joy of printing 385,118 pieces of papers, folders, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time when our printing plant was erected, our dear Lord opened possibilities to use radio to broadcast the truth. It was a great joy to our friends and a terrible astonishment for our enemies. First we used only Finnish, but now we have been sending also in Swedish and Russian, so our neighbors both in west and east have got the message. All together, 80 lectures have been broadcast from here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of our great difficulties has been the very severe financial depression in our country. Not only has it resulted in a very great number of people without work, but the lowering of the already very low wages has been so great that it has been a shame to pay human creatures so little. When the father of a big family gets 40c a day it signifies only a prolonged starving to death. And as this lowering of wages has specially touched the working people, who have been more interested in our books, it has been more difficult to place the books, especially the big ones. Therefore the result for our 673 service workers, 29,414 books, 163,321 booklets, 277,512 copies of our magazines, and 184,026 tracts and handbills, or, together, 654,273 pieces of literature, is not only encouraging, but marvelous. It is a testimony to the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. It is difficult to estimate how much more the friends had been able to place books if we had been able to place our books at the prices as, for instance, Germans. Now ours have been 2 to 3 times more expensive, and this signifies at least 3 or 4 times more work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this time of distress the food received through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has indeed been meat in due time, giving strength to the Lord’s army; and as the consecrated appreciate </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> so many of the people of good will seem to appreciate </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> which has to show a very good increase in its list of subscribers. It has gone up from 15,620 to 16,859. Also our opponents have been willing to subscribe for it, because they have admired the courageous stand it has taken in the burning questions of the day. We have also 1,443 subscribers for the Swedish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regional service directors are doing a very good work, as well as pioneers; and to our joy the knowledge of truth has penetrated all circles in our country, and by and by every one is compelled to take his stand for or against the truth. Generally our clergy have taken a very supercilious stand against the truth. They have often in various ways suggested to the government to stop our work, but so far without result. Yet recently one of our pioneers met a clergyman who took his stand for the truth. When she visited him he invited her to come in, and in the presence of his guests obtained the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span><span class="font4"> The following day they, by a mere chance, traveled in the same bus. The clergyman had his </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> with him and started to read it, recommending to all in the bus our books, pointing to the sister that they could have them from her, and that he did to every new passenger, with the result that the Bister could place books with them on account of the pastor’s recommendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On account of the Columbus convention extensions we have had the privilege of holding more conventions than in any year before. Not only have they been encouraging feasts, but all have been solemn occasions of service. The best and most wonderful was the last of them. With powerful ‘Aye’ we accepted the Resolution of our new name and decided to use more carefully all our means in glorifying the name of our great Jehovah God. At 46 conventions were present 2,367, and 78 symbolized their consecration; and during them were placed 14,435 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outlook for the Devil’s organization in our country is dark as the former darkness in Egypt, but the antitypical Israelites have light as in Goshen. We expect just our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light </span><span class="font4">books; and we hope that we, with and in its light, may be able to be faithful as Jehovah’s witnesses in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">fina</span><span class="font4">l fight, which cannot be very far ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LITHUANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The truth has not been in this country a very great while. There are many handicaps to the work, but the brethren are pressing on, doing by the Lord’s grace what their hands find to do. The total books and booklets distributed are included within the general report of the Northern European office; but in addition to what is there said the following is quoted from the local manager of the Lithuanian branch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year commenced with a good effort to surpass the results of the previous year, and for the first two months figures were well ahead of quota. Then various circumstances occurred to hinder the work. Heavy falls of snow made the roads impassable for some weeks. Then the thaw came, and conditions were even worse. Vast tracts were flooded and serious damage was caused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Memelgebiet, the territory that was formerly part of Germany, there are many zealous workers who look forward to the winter months as the time for best results. Then the people are usually at home, and money is not quite as scarce as during the remainder of the year. Journeys are made by means of a large motor-omnibus, which is hired, and long distances are traveled. This year, however, owing to the conditions above mentioned, much of this work was curtailed. An average of 11 workers per week placed 7,575 books and booklets. Much time was also spent in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> work, and 18,370 copies were distributed and 101 new subscriptions were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Lithuania, exclusive of the territory above mentioned, there has been a great shortage of workers. Last year there was an average of three full-time pioneers; this year there has been an average of only one. One or two isolated brethren occasionally take part in the work, but conditions in this country are so bad that most of their time has to be spent in ordinary work in order that sufficient food may be obtained. As an example of these conditions, in the capital town, Kaunas, a builder’s laborer earns only 7J American cents per hour. Women, doing similar work, receive as little as 5 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has indeed blessed the efforts of the few who have engaged in the work, and a total of 14,598 books and booklets have been distributed. The outstanding event of the year was, of course, the share we enjoyed in the Columbus convention. “Surprise Week” was indeed a pleasant surprise. During that period six workers placed 987 books and booklets and gave 1,308 testimonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is thrilling to realize that one of Jehovah’s witnesses can today proclaim the good news of the kingdom in forty languages, although he may be able to speak only one of them. Three pioneers have recently arrived from England, speaking only English; but they have already caused the clergy to warn their flocks against obtaining the books. Many of the people realize what frauds and humbugs the priests are, and so we are getting some free advertising. On one occasion these pioneers were stopped on their way home by a man who soon showed that he appreciated the message. He filled his pockets with books, making the pioneers understand that the books were for his friends, and that one was for the priest. On another occasion some men came up to them while they were witnessing. The only words the pioneers could understand of what was being said were the Lithuanian equivalent for “Mister! Mister! Books! Books!”, which was, of course, sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the various conventions which have been held during the year, the brethren have requested that a message of love and appreciation be sent to you. I have much pleasure in conveying that message, together with the assurance of my own love and appreciation of the bold lead you are giving to Jehovah’s witnesses at this time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark397"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark398"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The office of the Society for Latvia is at Riga. In addition to what is said in the general report from the Northern European office the following is quoted from the local manager at Riga:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Daring the year the total number of books and booklets sent out from the Riga office was 28,401. This number is slightly less than that for last year, the decrease being due to our stock of some of the Latvian books becoming exhausted and the difficulty experienced in receiving fresh supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work is being carried on under difficulties by those who are poor in this world’s goods, but who are rich in faith towards God. Many of the books have been banned by the government, which makes it an offense to distribute them. The opposition of the government to the work continues as strong as ever. It can only be because of the Lord’s protecting care, of which, we have had many evidences, that we have been able to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Latvia, church and state are united; the Lutheran being the state church. There is an old Russian law still in operation here which makes it a punishable offense to publish anything which could hurt the susceptibilities of the church. The law was first framed in the interests of the Russian orthodox church in the time of the czars; and now that the Lutherans have come to the fore in Latvia they are making use of it to hinder (so far as they are able) the spread of the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is an increasing interest being manifested in our message. The people see the crumbling of the old world and the failure of their hopes and expectations and are asking the reason therefor. They are coming to realize more and more that organized religion is merely seeking its own selfish interests and has no message of comfort for them. Many of those who sigh for the abominations done are being reached by the pioneers and company workers, and are being marked in their foreheads. Every week enquirers call at the office, asking for more books and wishing to know when others will be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the last week or two of the year just closed advices were received that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> book in Latvian was Teady, and a supply has since been received. Very soon we expect to have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font4"> and a reprint of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp.</span><span class="font4"> Two new books and a further supply of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font4"> will have a stimulating effect upon the work and be an encouragement to us all. The new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World</span><span class="font4"> has now been translated into Latvian and we look forward with pleasure to the privilege of placing this in the hands of the people at an early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five conventions were held during the year, at which the attendance totaled 134. Part of the time at each was used for service in the field, which was taken up enthusiastically by all. At a recent meeting held in Riga a resolution was unanimously passed joyfully accepting the new name which the Lord has given to his people. The Lord’s people here gladly accept the responsibilities and obligations to give the witness in this part of the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends in Latvia desire me to convey to you their warm love in the Lord and appreciation of your labors on their behalf, which I have much pleasure in doing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark399"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark400"></a>ESTHONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is another one of the Baltic States •where there is great darkness both on the rulers and on the ruled. It is associated with the Northern European office; but in addition to what is there said the following is quoted from the manager of the local office at Tallinn:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Out of a total of 17,974 books and booklets seven wholetime pioneers and two auxiliaries have been responsible for placing 14,377 of these in the hands of the public during the year. To do so has entailed much effort and traveling by push-bicycle and by foot. Often districts demanding much time to witness to have yielded very few placements; but, notwithstanding that, the pioneers have gone joyfully on telling the message of the kingdom to those who have ears to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are four companies composed chiefly of elderly women. The meetings which have been held are 140 in number, with a total attendance of 30,800. All of such meetings were advertised as public assemblies. The consecrated brethren who are able to be present at these meetings, together with two regional service directors, do what they can to encourage those attending and to help them to discern the privilege of sendee. While some success in this direction has been attained, resuiting in 486 books and booklets being placed, it cannot truly be said that there are any companies or that any are organized for service. This number of books placed is the result of the efforts put forth by twelve different workers, some of whom are isolated in the country. The average number of those out each week was three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year 35 meetings, with a total attendance of 250, were held in the Bethel on Sunday afternoons. These gatherings were of a private nature, and only the more interested attended. In the month of February a lecture tour was arranged to embrace the four more important towns. Four well advertised public meetings were held and Brother Bey addressed a total audience of about 3,000 on the topie “Peace and Prosperity for the People’’. In order to advertise these meetings, 24,000 folders, bearing a message concerning the kingdom, were distributed. Much interest was aroused as a result of these efforts; but it seems to have cooled off, leaving the position, as far as one is able to discern, just what it was. No doubt some are being ‘marked upon their foreheads’ and in their hearts by the work now being done by the anointed. Naturally, one looks for some tangible results, and I am convinced the Lord will reveal these in his own due time and way. I count myself honored of God in being permitted by him to have anything at all to do with the work he is now doing, and my heart is set upon being faithful in looking after the interests of the kingdom which have been placed in my hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each fortnight the leading article of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is rendered into Esthonian. By means of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> hand duplicator several copies are then produced. These “Vahitornid’’ are placed at the regular weekly meetings. The number of regular subscribers for the Esthonian and German editions of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is now eleven, which is an increase of one over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although there are only ten local brethren and usually five Finnish brethren, very happy conventions are held. In connection with Brother Dey’s visit in February, a home gathering was observed at which ten Esthonian and Finnish brethren were present. Very sweet service conventions were held as extensions of the great Columbus assembly. At one of these only three were present; but they went forth with the message of the King, knowing that they, in cooperation with thousands of brethren all over the earth, were a part of Jehovah’s company of witnesses. Twenty-four pieces of literature were placed. On August 2 another service convention was arranged in Tallinn and was attended by twelve brethren and friends. Every one present went out in the work, assisting in giving 174 testimonies and placing 71 books. Our annual convention followed on August 15 and 16. On the first day twenty were present, sixteen of whom took part on the second day, and twenty-three engaged in placing the kingdom literature. The totals are, 590 testimonies, 23 books and 170 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The arrangement to have a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study each week in the Bethel is one for which I give thanks to God. It will prove to be a source of strength and encouragement to us, so that we can go forward into the fight with a song of triumph on our lips and with full confidence in Him, 'who in righteousness doth judge and make war.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark401"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark402"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is one of the darkest and most backward countries where an effort is made to preach the message of the kingdom. The number of workers is very small, but they are faithfully plodding along and doing the best they can under the circumstances. The distribution of books and booklets in that country during the year aggregated 2,836.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark403"></a><span class="font5">Spain has been tom by revolutions during the year, and while the government is more liberal under the present form, yet the people are drifting rapidly into infidelity. From the manager’s report at Madrid, Spain, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year started with trouble, and the Devil would have disrupted the work here; but by the Lord’s grace we were able to continue. Although fewer have participated in giving the witness, the amount of literature distributed has increased slightly, amounting to 794 books and 8,283 booklets and a grand total of 9,217 pieces of all kinds of literature distributed. Additionally, nearly three times more copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">La Torre del Vigia</span><span class="font4"> than previously were given away, namely, 43,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a great and constant joy to note how a few isolated ones have patiently and consistently given the witness in spite of much opposition. The pioneers, of course, bore the brunt of the battle and endured much persecution. Their work during the past six months has been almost stopped, yet they managed to place 7,683 pieces of literature during the year; the remainder being practically the result of the three or four service workers’ efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The one great outstanding event here this year was the revolution in April, whereby the power of the clergy was broken and the people granted religious liberty and the possibility of emerging from the gross darkness in which papacy has held them for many centuries. Yet, although this has in a way favored us, a large portion of the people, now that their eyes have been opened to the former deceptions, have turned completely against every form of religion and almost against God. Owing to this and the unsettled condition of the country, due to underhand activities of priests and monarchists, and also because of the increase of communism, it has been quite impossible to work in some parts; and elsewhere it has been more difficult than before to place the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nevertheless, there are some who are ready for the good news and receiving it gladly, among them even some of the religious leaders.

Looking back to the difficulties and obstacles, and considering the way in which the Lord has now opened up the way for us, we exclaim: “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which Jehovah has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses at the Port of Spain, Trinidad, have been pushing on with the work during the year. There has been a slight increase in the number of workers during the year. Ten service conventions were held during the year, and many of the brethren participated in the field service work. All together, 200 workers have been engaged in the service, giving a total of 64,820 testimonies. The number of books distributed during the year were, to wit: Bound volumes 8,160, booklets 8,283. The brethren are much encouraged and are going forward with the kingdom work to the glory of the Lord.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font5">It is a real joy to review the work of the year. The Lord has abundantly blessed his people in their efforts to His praise. True to his promise he has shielded and protected them while they have done his work, and without which it would have been impossible for them to get on. The year 1931 stands at the head of the list, so far as bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah God is concerned. The servant class is small in number, but strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. We are now in troublesome times, but the anointed remnant may now well say, “For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.” —Ps. 27: 5, 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“They shall know that I am Jehovah.&quot; —Ezek. 6:10, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH’S will plainly expressed is that all men shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth, which great truth is that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God; that Christ is the Redeemer and King of the world; and that his kingdom will vindicate Jehovah’s name and bless the obedient ones of mankind. During the past 1900 years the nations called “Christendom” have had the opportunity to learn of Jehovah and his purposes but have failed and refused to give heed to his Word and learn. The leaders and teachers in Christendom have turned the people away from God and into darkness, because they have been instruments of Satan, the great enemy of God. These nations must now be informed that Jehovah is God and that he will shortly destroy the wicked organization; and this warning must be given even though they refuse to hear it.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark410"></a><span class="font6">Within the land called “Christendom” there is a great multitude of people who profess to be followers of Christ Jesus and who have made a covenant to do the will of God. These are held as prisoners by reason of their fear of 155 men and man-made organizations. They must be warned that God’s kingdom is at hand and that in order for them to obtain life they must take their stand on the side of Jehovah and separate themselves from the Devil’s organization. There are millions of people who have a desire to see righteousness and truth abound but who by reason of mental blindness know not the way by which their desire may be realized. These must be informed that Jehovah is the only true God and that his kingdom under Christ is their one and only hope. They must come to know God if they would live. The majority in Christendom will refuse to give heed to the warning; and in order that all may know that Jehovah is God and never have excuse to open their mouths to the contrary, Jehovah will perform his strange act in the great battle of the day of God Almighty, and which will completely wreck Christendom and all of Satan’s organization. Before this great and terrible day comes upon the world, it is the will of Jehovah God that notice shall be served upon Christendom, upon the great multitude, and upon the peoples of good desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has taken out from amongst men a small company, otherwise designated the remnant, and upon whom he has bestowed the privilege and duty of serving such notice. Members of this company Jehovah designates as his witnesses, and they are therefore a part of his organization. These are made teachers and leaders of the people and commanded to point them to the way of the kingdom. Those composing the remnant now know Jehovah is God and besides him there is none other. When Jehovah brings death and desolation upon Christendom, then all will know that Jehovah is God, and those who have received the testimony of his witnesses, and who turn to Jehovah and take their stand wholly on his side, will receive protection. In the end the name of Jehovah God will be vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses must now keep in mind the work they are commissioned to do. Their work is to be faithful and true witnesses to the name and purpose of Jehovah. Such work is of greatest importance to them. To aid these anointed ones to keep in mind the responsibility and the duty laid upon them a scripture text is arranged for each and every day of the year. Begin the day aright and continue in the right way throughout the day. Each morning read and carefully consider the text for the day. If possible, listen in to the morning devotional radio program and during the day give consideration to the text. Keep in mind always that the name of Jehovah must now be made known and that his name he will vindicate before all creation, and that his witnesses are blessed with the privilege and opportunity of having some part therein. Feed upon food that is convenient. Be of good courage and continue to sing the praises of Jehovah’s name. That song of praise now raised by the remnant will continue to increase until everything that has the breath of life will join therein to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s name is of far greater importance than all things else. The time must come when his name will be upon every creature, and then everything that breathes will extol and honor his name. Only those who come to a knowledge of Jehovah and who honor his name will be given life everlasting. Jesus so stated when he was on earth, but only a few to this day have believed that his words are true. The defaming of God’s name was begun by the traitor Satan, and the entire organization which the enemy builded has continued to reproach his holy name. The removing of Satan and his organization will result in clearing Jehovah’s name, and then all intelligent creatures may learn without hindrance the way to life. The truth must be made known that the name of Jehovah may be vindicated. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The faithful see the workers of iniquity prosper, but they are told not to envy the wieked ones or to fret because of this evil and unhappy condition. It has been difficult for men to understand why God would permit the workers of iniquity to prosper while at the same time those devoted to him were in adversity. This problem is solved only in God’s due time when he is pleased to show to his people that the great question at issue is the vindication of his word and name, and that for this purpose he has refrained from destroying the wicked ones earlier, and not for the purpose of teaching men lessons. The Lord now assures us that soon these evildoers and workers of iniquity will be cut down like the grass and that will be a vindication of his word and name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God.—Rev. 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The tree of life’’ is associated with God’s kingdom. The warning of the Lord is that “if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city’’. (Margin) It represents everlasting life by means of the unfailing sustenance which the Lord provides for his own. Divine wisdom is likened unto a tree of life. (Prov. 3:13-18) Jehovah is the fountain of life, and even the 144,000 immortal ones will depend upon him that they may not “be hurt of the second death”. Hence the tree of life may well refer to the privilege which the church will enjoy in beholding the beauty and glory of Jehovah and inquiring continuously in his temple.— Ps. 27:4. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.—Ps. 34: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “poor man” is the remnant or those composing the servant class who are poor in spirit and teachable in mind, waiting upon the Lord and always anxious to hear his call to service and to diligently obey that call. During the testing period from 1918 to 1919 the faithful ones particularly realized they were poor and entirely dependent upon the Lord. It was then that Christ Jesus began to gather together unto himself those whom he found faithful on coming to his temple, and such he made a part of the “servant” class. Then the “servant” began to understand that the Lord had come to help them. They were then fearful, but when they realized that the Lord had much for them to do and would lead them in that work the fearful were saved out of their troubles. To be sure, troubles continue, but the faithful remnant do not fear man. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is my shepherd.—Ps. 23:1, A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was with his disciples he said of himself: “I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.” Jesus was and is the shepherd over the sheep which God has given to him, and Jehovah is the great Shepherd over all them that are his. Prior to coming to the temple of God and gathering his own unto himself Jesus occupied the place of shepherd to the flock of God. It is not unreasonable to say that since then Jesus and his flock are more closely united as the joint “servant” and therefore the “servant” is spoken of as the flock of Jehovah. Only such “servant” could speak of Jehovah as his shepherd. The “servant” as a whole enjoys a different relationship to Jehovah from that which it is possible for any individual member thereof to have, and one which the remnant could not have prior to 1918.

<p><span class="font5">The judgments of Jehovah, as written, will be executed because of the traducing of his name and for the vindication thereof. The great defamer of God’s name is Satan the Devil, and Christendom not only has fallen away to the Devil, but has become his chief instrument among the nations of earth to practice fraud and hypocrisy and to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. The visible manifestation of Jehovah’s judgments and the vindication of his name will be a thorough lesson to all who remain on the earth, and all shall know that Jehovah is the Almighty God. The name of Jehovah God, and its vindication, is of paramount importance. While his faithful ones on earth are kept under the protection of Jehovah and are proclaiming his praises, he will execute his judgment upon Christendom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 64, 65</span></p>

Now they see that Satan has recruited to his forces, and brought to the front, those who were once the children of Jehovah and who also walked in the light until lawlessness led them into the wrong paths. Now these derelict ones have become bitter foes of the faithful, and because of their former knowledge are better equipped to be used by Satan against those who are in the favor of God. But none of these things cause the faithful to fear or tremble or to deviate from their steadfastness in devotion to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 12:17,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus continued to impress upon his hearers that Jehovah his Father always speaks the truth and that he, Jesus, had come to the earth to bear witness to the truth. (John 18:37) He made this the most important part of his mission. No one could possibly have any doubt as to where Jesus stood. He was for the truth under all conditions, and therefore always on the side of his Father; and he was there because he loved his Father. The positive course of righteousness taken by Jesus drew upon his head the constant fire of the enemy Satan. That, however, did not at all deter Jesus from continuing in the way of righteousness and In his unqualified devotion to Jehovah. He fearlessly and boldly continued to preach the truth to those who would hear. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">After 1918 the consecrated came to realize that love is not sentimentality nor “character growth”, but is an unselfish devotion to Jehovah God, which means the unselfish performance of the covenant in looking well to the interests of God’s cause and his people, out of which people the house of the Lord is built. Salvation through death and getting into heaven is not the most important thing. That which is of paramount importance is the building of Jehovah’s royal house by the use of which he will vindicate his glorious name. It is for this very purpose that he takes out from amongst men a people for his name; and when these come to a realization that their chief duty is to glorify God, then they are beginning to see their covenant in a proper way.

<p><span class="font5">Now only a few know the great Jehovah God. Many false prophets speak in his name, and because their speech is false they turn the people away from God. Jehovah declared that he would have a people on earth at this time whom he would appoint as his witnesses to tell the people that he is the only true God. To be appointed to such position is a wonderful favor. Therefore those on the earth who are his witnesses are the most favored people that have ever been on the earth. They are not speaking with each other so much concerning the exalted place to be occupied by them in the kingdom, however, but they are deeply concerned with and speaking of the duties and privileges God has bestowed upon them.

<p><span class="font5">One of the titles which Jehovah gave to his beloved Son is “The Son of man”. “The Son of man” is God’s ‘elect servant’. The approved ones selected at the temple by Jesus Christ are designated collectively as the “faithful and wise servant” to whom are committed the kingdom interests, which means the giving of the testimony that was committed first to Jesus Christ. Such class is made a part of God’s “servant”, and therefore when the Lord addresses Ezekiel by the title “son of man” it is certain that Ezekiel was used to foreshadow that class known as the “faithful and wise servant”. If God’s purpose is to give warning to Christendom, it reasonably follows that he would use this people who compose the “servant” class to do that work. The Scriptures abundantly support that conclusion. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/31</span></p>

Then and there the Lord took his power as the world’s rightful Ruler. In the third year of his reign he made a feast to his princes and servants. The first work of Christ Jesus, supported by his heavenly host, was to engage Satan in a war and cast the enemy out of heaven and down to the earth. Following that victory would be an appropriate time for Christ to make a feast for his princes and his myriad of holy angels, as indicated by Revelation 12: 9-12. Jesus, the Lord of heaven and earth, had entered into his joy because he was proceeding under Jehovah’s command to vindicate the name of his Father. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “white stone” is given, not individually, but to the faithful servant class. It is the token of God’s approval or official designation of such as his servant or representative; and Jehovah gives his vote for such by and through Christ Jesus and confers upon the faithful class this favor by giving them the white stone. Such official and authoritative designation is not known or understood by anyone except those who have received the stone, the vote of Jehovah approving them. The new name is written in the stone, meaning that upon this class he confers the great privilege of bearing this name and having a clear understanding of Jehovah and his purposes and communicating the same to the people.

The Bible is therefore his Word of truth. Since Jehovah supervised the writing of the Scriptures, it must be conceded that he also supervised the placing in the Bible the books that properly belong there. The fact that the Bible has successfully withstood all assaults of its enemies is corroborative proof that what it contains is there by the will of God for the purpose of making known his course of action toward men. The enemy would diminish the book of Esther from the Bible by declaring it un-canonical. However, the book of Esther is a part of the Bible; and just as certain as it was placed there by the will of God, just that certain it is authentically a part of the Bible. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/31</span></p>

Some prophecies have been fulfilled, and some are in course of fulfilment; and by his grace and his spirit God makes known to his ‘elect servant’ some things that are shortly to come to pass, and thus the “new things’’ he now declares to them “before they spring forth”. Fulfilment of prophecy must take place and be made known to some of these anointed ones while on the earth, because comfort and encouragement are for their benefit while they are on the earth, and particularly for the remnant on earth “in the last day”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">VI, 16</span></p>

Those who have once walked with the remnant as their brethren in Christ have also forsaken them. But this condition of abandonment of the servant and his apparent loneliness does not disturb him at all.

<p><span class="font5">One may be weeping tears of bitterness by reason of persecution and ill treatment and slander heaped upon him by the “evil servant” class and others of Satan’s agents, and still not slack the hand in delivering the testimony committed to him. Doing this because he loves God and because he thus has a part in the vindication of God’s name proves it is unselfish and is strong evidence that he is in the joy of the Lord. Because one loves righteousness and hates lawlessness, and because he is determined to have some part in giving honor to God’s name, he goes on through the storm of persecution and slander and at the same time is conscious of an inward joy that his course of action is right and lawful and that he is on the Lord’s side, and such is proof that one is really in the joy of the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">The king’s command was to bring Queen Vashti before him. This was a test of her lawful submission to the will of the king. Her refusal to obey was a serious act of insubordination. During the period of rejoicing following the casting of Satan out of heaven the Lord suddenly appeared at his temple. He would then have those who were in line for the kingdom and for a place upon the throne to be brought before him that they might take their stand wholly on the Lord’s side and thus display to the world their “beauty of holiness” to the Lord, showing a complete devotion to him and his cause. Such was a test. Those obeying the commandment would demonstrate their integrity toward God. Those refusing to humble themselves before the Lord under such a test would be separated from the faithful. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the Father of mercies and God of all comfort. Knowing that his children in the land of the enemy would need comfort he has made provision therefor. One of the provisions Jehovah has made is that those who love him may approach his throne of grace in prayer. He knows the heart motive of each one, and he who honestly is devoted to God and is faithfully serving him may be always sure that God will hear his prayer. “O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.” (Ps. 65: 2) ‘‘For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers.” (1 Pet. 3:12) God caused his faithful prophet to write: “Mine house shall be called an house of prayer.” (Isa. 56:7) Every servant who has faith in God shows his faith by what he does.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord has ordered the way in which his “servant” shall walk. That course of action must be right and perfect, because the Lord has ordered it. Whether one is in the covenant to do the Lord’s will is entirely a different matter. If one does not perform the terms of his covenant he is no part of the remnant and no part of the “servant” whose steps Jehovah directs. For this reason it can be said with absolute certainty that the remnant is in the right way and delights in that way because the Lord has made the provision for his servant. Those who oppose the work of the servant or remnant class are therefore opposing God. If God has an organization on earth through which he is doing his work, and the servant or remnant is in that organization, then the way that such is going must necessarily be the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/31</span></p>

Where there are those who claim to be followers of Christ and who are using the soft pedal concerning Satan’s organization, or who insist on keeping still and ignoring the fact that Satan has an organization, such is conclusive proof that they are not of Zion, whatever else might be their position.

<p><span class="font5">God commanded the Jews to go up to Mount Lebanon, where grew the great cedars, and bring down, not fire wood, but sturdy logs and beams and joists to rebuild the house of the Lord. Even so about 1922 the commandment of the Lord to his people was to go and do the work laid out for them to do concerning the King and the kingdom. They must then go forward and proclaim Jehovah’s name and mighty works and say to each other: ‘Our God reigneth. The kingdom is here. Busy yourself to make these truths known.’ No other kind of work could then be properly or really done by the consecrated that would glorify the name of the Lord.

The Lord puts his spirit upon his people and reveals to them a sufficient amount of the truth to enable them to discern God’s organization, and the wicked organization of Satan in opposition to the Lord, and the great privilege that they have in being in Jehovah’s organization and going into action against the enemy and his agencies. When they see the hideousness and wickedness of Satan’s organization they go in ‘the heat of the spirit’ and with bitterness against the enemy, because the enemy is God’s enemy. Such is not a malicious hatred, but a sincere and earnest desire to see the enemy and his organization destroyed that God’s name might be exalted. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 39, 40</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God has used some of the “servant” class to point out to others the great necessity of now taking a bold stand on the Lord’s side. Those who would be faithful to God cannot now hold themselves in secret and not disclose themselves about God’s organization and their part in it. The time has come when every one of the remnant must clearly be identified as on the Lord’s side. There is no compromise. Their declarations must be for God and his Christ and his kingdom; otherwise such could not be of the bride class. The words of Jesus are now appropriate: “He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, seattereth abroad.” If one is unfaithful to God he will raise up another to take the place of that unfaithful one, because God’s work will now be done.

The true rule is that where the Lord places a man in a position to serve Him he cannot please the Lord and deviate therefrom one jot or tittle by being influenced by any other creature, and particularly by a female.

His faithfulness unto death provided the ransom price for fallen man, and his exaltation to heaven opened the way for other creatures to follow in his steps; but this was not the moving cause on his part. That which moved Jesus to the course of action taken by him was his love for Jehovah, and that which moved Jehovah to preserve and exalt Jesus was pure unselfishness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/31</span></p>

At the same time the remnant is plainly told in God’s Word that Satan seeks the destruction of those who are faithful to God at this time. The faithful, therefore, know that they are surrounded by the enemy who conspires to destroy them. Therefore they do not treat with indifference and insolent scorn the threatened assault to murder by the enemy. On the contrary, they view the situation with seriousness and move with great caution, and their prayers are constantly to God for his protection, preservation and deliverance. The faithful go forward in the performance of duty, working out their own salvation in fear and with cautious trembling before the Lord. They wish to make no mistakes.

It includes his beloved Son and all the host of heavenly creatures in harmony with God, and it includes those on earth who are faithful and true to God.

The remnant, being wholly devoted to God, are unwaveringly held on the course of righteousness and steadfastly continue to be faithful. By thus proceeding lawfully in delivering the testimony, proof will be given of their entire love and devotion to God.

<p><span class="font5">The Apostle Paul, addressing the church, speaks of those who come into judgment in the last days because they received not the love of the truth. (2 Thess. 2:10) What is meant by receiving the love of the truth? Clearly the meaning is that one receives the truth and devotes himself wholly and unselfishly to the truth because the truth honors, magnifies and vindicates God’s word and name. It follows, then, that anyone who receives a knowledge of the truth and who uses that knowledge for a selfish purpose does not receive the love of the truth. The one who receives the love of the truth is sanctified by the truth. The others are not, and do not abide in the Lord’s tabernacle or in his holy kingly organization Zion.

Had Christendom heeded the repeated warnings that Jehovah has given her, this might have been avoided. There is a class, however, that will give heed and is giving heed to God’s message of truth that he is causing his “servant” now to proclaim, and this prophecy is another strong proof that “millions now living will never die” but will be brought through the terrible trouble. The Lord will spare some creatures upon the earth, and these shall furnish the nucleus for the beginning of reconstruction before the resurrection of the dead.

These faithful ones did not resent the message of the “Lord’s messenger”, nor say as some of the unfaithful continue to say: ‘Oh, it’s merely one man’s opinion, and so we do not need to take it seriously. We will use our own best judgment and do what we think best.’ Contrary to this stubborn disposition thus manifested the faithful responded with joy of heart and have continued to respond and to do the work which the Lord has given his people to do.

No longer are God’s devoted people left in doubt as to where they are. When the prophecies of the Bible were opened to the view of the “servant” class, and continued to open like a beautiful flower, spreading sweet fragrance all about, there was no longer reason or room for doubt concerning God’s provision for his own. Still waters are deep. God is now revealing to his “servant” the deeper things of his prophetic word. The “servant” therefore now says of Jehovah: “He leadeth me beside the still waters [or, waters of quietness].” The storms without beat against God’s people, and the wrath of the enemy greatly increases, but the “servant” is in a sheltered place, feeding upon the refreshing and life-sustaining food. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">IV 1/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With the end of the earthly career of the apostles the unity of the consecrated quickly passed away. Approximately from the year 1878 forward Christ Jesus began to carry forward the work of preparing the way before Jehovah. Among other things he did was to restore the truth and to bring the faithful out from Babylon. Then followed the building up of Zion and the appearing of the Lord in his glory. (Ps. 102:16) It is certain from the Scriptures that the temple of God must be built of the “living stones” all of which are in God’s organization. It is wholly inconsistent to think that God has more than one general organization or that he would have on earth several divisions of his organization. God has one people on earth that are his, and at the present time there is unity among such. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The ark of the covenant in the temple is a symbol of Jehovah’s presence. The blood of the atonement sacrifice was sprinkled upon the ark, representing the covenant by sacrifice. The completion of the covenant by sacrifice is Jehovah’s chief consideration during the Christian era, and particularly so during the period of the fulfilment of The Revelation. The complete establishment of the kingdom hinges upon the performance of this covenant, and in symbol the “ark” of Jehovah is now present in order that the blood of this sacrificial covenant may be sprinkled upon it in due course. The location of the ark was the place where the tribes of Israel went up and had a rally. (Ps. 122:4) Now at this day God’s faithful witnesses must rally to the performance of the covenant by sacrifice, and in so doing give praise to Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 228</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In harmony with this God first causes his own people to feed upon his truth and to grow strong thereby, and then their strength must be used in obedience to his commandment to the glory of the Lord by speaking these truths to others. This is further corroborated by Jehovah’s words to the Prophet Isaiah (51:16): “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” The message of the Lord he puts in the mouth of his “servant” not merely to feed upon for his own benefit, but that it might be used in accordance with God’s commandments by proclaiming it to others. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V1, 36,37</span></p>

The messengers have been from Jehovah and have set his remnant class right on their feet and opened their eyes that they might see where they now are and what they are to do. To those fearlessly and faithfully doing the work as commanded, Jehovah now says, “I am with you,” even as he said to the Israelites; therefore, “If God be for us, who can be against us?” Those of the remnant know they are right and are on the Lord’s side, and they are determined to go forward regardless of all opposition.

It is a time of rejoicing and, as the psalmist says, it is good to declare the goodness and faithfulness of Jehovah in the morning and at night, meaning that at all times of the day it is good to praise the Most High. Jehovah has provided the instruments to be used in singing his praises and in telling of his wondrous works. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite.—Esther 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His father’s name was “Jair”, meaning “my light; who diffuses light, or who is enlightened”. His grandfather’s name was Shimei, meaning that one “who hears or obeys or has heard; my name or fame”. His great-grandfather was named Kish, meaning “hard, difficult”. The significance of these names seems to say of Mordecai that he was enlightened by Jehovah and diffused that light and joy to others; that he heard and obeyed Jehovah and was zealous for the name and fame of the Most High; and for this cause he endured much hardness and many difficulties. In so doing, as his own name signifies, he was like “bruised myrrh” or sweet perfume. This suggests that he was a sweet savor unto the Lord. This is a reason why he seems to fully picture the Lord’s “good and faithful servant”. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 16: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the great testing time began in 1918 some who had the truth acted foolishly and declined to learn wisdom from the Lord. It is now folly to try to instruct them. Some of these have with much vehemence said: ‘We will not be bound; we will be free to follow the course that seems right to us. We will not take any suggestions as to how the work of the Lord shall be carried on.’ They refuse to humble themselves under the mighty hand of God. “A wicked man hardeneth his face; but as for the upright, he directeth his way. There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel, against the Lord.” (Prov. 21: 29,30) Surely all these things were set forth in the Word of God for the special benefit of the remnant now on the earth.—Rom. 15:4.

<p><span class="font5">What is the great desire of the righteous? It is to see Jehovah’s name exalted, his kingdom in full sway, and his blessings of peace and prosperity bestowed upon the creatures of earth, to his glory. God’s faithful people desire to see the wicked works of the enemy of God and the enemies of God destroyed because they reproach his name. However, the Lord has not appointed any of his remnant to do this work of destruction. That he has reserved for himself by and through his duly appointed agents. The business of the remnant is to sing the praises of Jehovah with full confidence at all times, and be moved to do so by unselfishness; thus they show their full faith in and love for God. Time is an important element here because in God’s due time he will accomplish all his purposes. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The commandment or cry was from Christ Jesus, the executive officer of Jehovah. The cry directs the Lord’s organization to prepare for the final assault upon the enemy organization. They are told to draw near with their weapons of destruction drawn and ready for offensive action. Those weapons that will be used for destruction by violence are held by the Lord Jesus and the invisible members of the organization under him. The visible part of his organization on earth will do no part of the destroying. The work assigned to the earthly division, God’s “faithful servant’’ class, is to sing forth the praises of Jehovah’s name before and while the fight is in progress.

<p><span class="font5">It is a time for prayer and cleansing that acceptable service might be performed. This is done that God’s displeasure might be turned away and that acceptable service might follow. (Isa. 12:1-5) It is “the day of the Lord” and the enemy is made known to the remnant, and the remnant pray for protection and greater opportunities of service. (Eph. 6:12-19) The remnant also pray for prosperity and victory (Ps. 118:24, 25) ; and for peace among themselves, that they may work to the Lord’s glory. (Ps. 122: 6-8) ; and for the open door of service (Col. 4:3); and that they may not enter into temptation. (Matt. 26:41) “The end of all things is at hand,” and the remnant pray that the message of truth may now have a free course.—1 Pet. 4: 7; 2 Thess. 3:1. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 101</span></p>

All the faithful remnant must now be identified as God’s people. This, of course, puts each and every one of them in a perilous position, because they are marked by the enemy for slaughter. It would be wrong for the remnant to compromise with earthly rulers, because the faithful must not ‘go down to Egypt for help’ and compromise with the world because of the powerful influence thereof. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/31</span></p>

The truth he properly appreciates, and it has had the proper influence upon him. The humble creature is he who is anxious to know God’s will and is diligent to do it when he learns it. When he hears the message delivered by one whom the Lord is using he is glad to listen and learn. He recognizes that the truth is the Lord’s, and not man’s, and that the servant is merely one who bears the fruits of the Lord’s production.

(Ps. 102:16) Jehovah has now accepted his faithful approved ones, and they do now serve him in the promised “land”. The “land” which Jehovah swore with uplifted hand to give unto his anointed was the kingdom and the kingdom privileges and places in his organization as his witnesses to do the work he has commissioned them to do.—Luke 22: 29, 30. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 267</span></p>

None on the earth aside from the remnant can appreciate what it means to be in the temple. The promise of the Lord is not that he will prevent his children from having fiery trials, but the promise to the anointed is that God will keep his children in these trials provided the child of God steadfastly holds his integrity. The terms of the covenant must be met. The remnant is the chief objective of Satan’s attack, and he uses various agencies to accomplish the destruction of the remnant. Satan attacks at what he considers the most vulnerable point. As a complete offset to Satan’s attack Jesus says the above words to his true followers.

<p><span class="font5">Looking back over the experiences since 1918, those who love God see that many have fallen away. Some of these false ones have been very dear to others who remain faithful. Let none, however, mourn for those who have fallen away. The greatest privilege that any creature could possibly have is to know and to faithfully serve Jehovah God. If this privilege is not appreciated, no one having the spirit of Christ could love the ungrateful who withdraw from their covenant. Let the unfaithful pass out of mind and be forgotten for ever, as though they never existed. Let all who truly love God stand firmly together and serve him.

(1 John 2:1) “The word of their testimony,” which is also mentioned, manifestly means that these have been faithful witnesses to the name of God and of Christ, by giving testimony thereto. One cannot be pleasing to God if he does not act as a witness to God’s word and name. To be witness for him is one of Jehovah’s positive commandments.

<p><span class="font5">The faithful ones see that the blood of Christ Jesus shed at Calvary was and is for the redemption of themselves and not for themselves only but for all who will hear and obey the Lord. They see that Christ has been placed upon his throne and sent forth by Jehovah to rule and to destroy the enemy; that the enemy’s world has come to an end and that Christ has returned and begun the ousting proceedings of the wrongdoer; that he is gathering his people unto himself and invites them to enter into his joy. They see that the great question that has long been at issue and which must now be for ever settled in the right way is that involving the word and name of Jehovah; that Christ Jesus is come to vindicate his Father’s name and will do so and that this is the joy of the Lord.

Only those having full faith and confidence in and love for God and his kingdom will now declare the truth with boldness. This is the day of judgment, and those who really love God will speak with boldness. (1 John 4:17,18) Others who have received the truth but not the love of it will go to the rulers in Christendom and declare their own allegiance to such as “the higher powers”, thereby hoping to save their own hides. And now a great reproach is laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses; but when his name is vindicated, the surviving people will know that Jehovah had in the land men and women who without fear and with joy declared his truth.

Doubtless not only was Mordecai used as an instrument of the Lord to direct Esther to enter the race or contest for the place of queen to the emperor, but also it was he who informed her that she must comply with the rules of the contest.

Can a people claim to be God’s people and pursue a course similar to that of the heathen? Jehovah has separated his people for a different purpose. He planted the vine and brought forth the branches thereof for the very purpose of bearing testimony to the truth of his Word and to the honor of his name. Christ Jesus is the true vine, and those in Christ are the branches. The office of the branch is to bear fruit, and by its so doing Jehovah is honored and glorified. “Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away. ...

It could not be truly said that Jesus had failed in his work and that God must show mercy unto him in Gethsemane. Jesus performed everything perfectly. Truly Jesus could say that Jehovah is gracious and righteous, but the Lord’s mercy mentioned here clearly applies in particular to the body members of the <sup>4</sup>‘servant” and from and after their Gethsemane experience in 1918.

The feast must be something more than what the consecrated enjoyed before the Lord’s coming to the temple. The feast which causes rejoicing is not the restoration of the ten fundamental doctrines to the church, but the unfolding of the prophecies showing that the King is on his throne, that the kingdom has begun, and that the great privilege of knowing and serving Jehovah is here.

To be sure, these charges are false, but they are made just the same. None of the Lord’s workers are peddlers in any sense or doing a commercial business at all, and surely none that is in any wise in competition with anyone else. It is wholly inconsistent to arrest anyone who is going about proclaiming God’s kingdom on the day called Sunday. Of course, we know this is the result of the laws of the organization of this world.

Those who do not watch continuously will be deceived by the platitudes of Satan’s prophets, captured and stripped naked, and caused to walk in the procession of Satan, and the enemy will “see his shame”.

Those who are now of the priestly order in the church were creatures once “dead in trespasses and sins” and “were by nature children of wrath, even as others”; and therefore by nature unclean. When one becomes Christ’s follower, instead of being able to make anything or everything holy unto the Lord by his “wonderful character” or other merit of his own, the very opposite is true to the facts. Being naturally dead and in a defiled condition the creature would defile everything of the Lord that he touches were it not for the fact that his justification and approval by Jehovah is granted by and through Jesus’ merit.

This doubtless marks the beginning of the song of the Hallelujah chorus. The multitude of singers would include the risen saints and the remnant on earth, which latter class is ‘seated in heavenly places’, and would include also all the angels of the Lord, and therefore all of God’s holy organization.

<p><span class="font5">It is the duty and privilege laid upon the faithful ones gathered together for Jehovah’s use and service to make known his righteous judgment and to make known his reason for executing the same. Jehovah will afford ample opportunity for his name to be known, and his remnant is given the privilege of declaring his judgments and of telling the testimony, that his name may be known. It may appear to some that such is an unpleasant duty, but to those who love the Lord nothing can be an unpleasant duty when performed at the commandment of Jehovah. It is an unpleasant message to the ears of those who do not love the Lord God, but it is a joy to those who delight to have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s great name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 297</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain; and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar; and I fell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">on my face.—Ezek. 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah commanded Ezekiel to separate himself and go into the plain, that the Lord might talk with him there. The “faithful servant” class must be separate from Christendom, from the “evil servant” class, and, in fact, from all not in complete harmony with God’s organization. The “faithful servant” must stand out separate and alone as the target of the enemy and as the witness for the Lord. These faithful ones gather themselves together unto the Lord in a condition of separateness, and the Lord’s glory appears unto them. The vision of God’s organization is there before them, because the spirit of the Lord is upon them even as it was upon Ezekiel. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 43, 44</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For some time the remnant has seen that there is a great work yet to be done; and although it is fraught with much danger by reason of the enemy’s activity, it shall be done and carried to a successful end, because Jehovah has commanded it and says he is with those who are faithful and who continue to do the work according to his commandments. It is not for the remnant to say when they shall slack the work or sit down and be at ease. God through his prophet clearly indicates that this work must go on. To the question, “Lord, how long?” as propounded by the Prophet Isaiah, representing God’s remnant, the answer is given by the Lord: “Until the cities [organizations of the enemy] be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.”—Isa. 6:11,12.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments.—Deut. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Full performance of the terms of the covenant by the creature, the servant, will bring to him the great prize of immortality. But even in this the servant is forever dependent upon Jehovah, because Jehovah is in the other side of the covenant. In these last days, when conditions are strenuous and the fight is sharp, God graciously provides in his Word food for the new creature by which he can be sure of the continued favor of the Most High. The servant has every reason to have full confidence in Jehovah, because he knows that Jehovah keeps inviolate every promise he makes. The servant delights to serve Jehovah because he loves him, and he proves his love by boldly representing the Most High. With ever increasing joy the servant goes forward singing the new song to the honor of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Jesus appeared at the temple of Jehovah he made the above announcement. This proves that the people must be told that the day of judgment is at hand, and that all must be given an opportunity to hear what God’s Word has to say concerning that judgment day. There is no excuse for the covenant people of God to be in darkness concerning the day of the great battle of God Almighty. All who have agreed to do his will are told to search the Scriptures, wherein the expression of his will is found, and to study that they might have the approval of God. (2 Tim. 2:15) Christ’s followers are commanded thus to do, not for their own personal gain, but that they might be witnesses to others. These witnesses must inform others concerning the will of God and serve notice upon them that Jehovah is the only God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V 1,137</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Return unto thy rest, 0 my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.—Ps. 116:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in 1919 that the church began to realize that deliverance had come. In the year 1922 the church had a better appreciation of that deliverance and that there was yet much work to be done to the honor of God’s great name. Jehovah had dealt bountifully with the “servant”, and in the latter part of 1919 the faithful began to rest in the Lord and to fully trust him and rejoice. Then the Lord began the opening to the faithful of a better understanding of the Scriptures. Truly then the “servant” was freed from tears and his feet became strong to run on in the work set before him. It was a time of new courage and confidence in God. The faithful now began to manifest real love for God. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus is foreshadowed the favorable conditions the Lord provides for those who have responded to the call for the kingdom to make preparation therefor. Among those coming to a knowledge of the truth since 1922 are those pictured by Esther. They have had the best place in the Lord’s service because they have participated in the service with real joy and enthusiasm. They have not been looking at the matter from a selfish standpoint, but their unselfish devotion to the Lord and his cause has shown forth their beauty. Appropriate to these are the words: “Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.” These faithful ones were showing worthy traits before the Lord, and this the Lord has rewarded by his unchanging favor. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubhabel . . . and the spirit of Joshua . . . the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came, and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts, their God.—Hag. 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font5"> the Lord organized his people to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem, even so now he has an organization on earth. It is worse than foolish for anyone who claims to believe in God to say that He has no such organization. Every one who will admit the facts must say that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, or those who faithfully stand together and who are called the “Society”, constitutes God’s visible organization. Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple “not made with hands”, is directing the work now being done by the remnant. The remnant are joyfully doing this work in obedience to the Lord’s commandments, and they thus do it by telling the “testimony of Jesus Christ” which he has committed to the remnant.

<p><span class="font5">The total number sealed is 144,000 and must of necessity include those who died in faith and waited for the resurrection. God’s sign of approval upon them is shown by his awakening them out of death, in 1918. The remnant on earth received the robe of righteousness and the place in the temple and were given a better appreciation of the kingdom; and their loving zeal therefor is proof of their sealing. All are “spiritual Israelites” because they are God’s chosen “nation” and their right to live is as spirit creatures. The fact that one is in the covenant by sacrifice would not make him eligible for the kingdom; he must be in the covenant for the kingdom and be wholly devoted to the Lord and then receive the Lord’s approval, symbolized by the seal. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 89</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.—Ps. 37:6, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the wicked workers, acting in conjunction with evildoers, think they have the Lord’s faithful people in the bag, so to speak, and that their work is blocked, then the Lord will demonstrate his favor upon his faithful by destroying the wicked. (Ps. 92:7) When the wicked are destroyed, then the faithful will appear fully in the light and the Lord will exhibit them as his approved ones, and his faithful representatives. Jesus said concerning the workers of iniquity that they would first be gathered out and destroyed and “then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father”. Those who trust in the Lord and faithfully obey his commandments will be fully taken care of as he has promised. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s organization is his chosen nation. When Armageddon is over, it will be recognized that Jehovah’s organization is the “worst” thing that ever came against Satan’s organization, and therefore they will realize that God sent against them that which is the very worst for them. By his organization the Lord will make a clean sweep of hypocritical Christendom, and the frightfulncss of the war forces of Satan’s organization will be nothing compared to the fright that Jehovah’s organization will give the Devil’s crowd. Then Jehovah will make his name to be feared in all the earth, and all shall come to know that Jehovah is the God eternal, the God almighty, whose power is irresistible. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 76</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now the remnant are at war with Satan, who is desperately striving to destroy them because such are the only real enemies of Satan that are on earth. We must expect to fight to the end. At once it is apparent that the follower of Christ must pursue his course in patience. But patience does not mean outward cheerfulness while enduring trials. On the contrary, one may be weeping outwardly and at the same time be patiently enduring and progressing. There may not appear any good cheer on his countenance. Patience means constancy and steadfastness in the performance of duty amidst opposition or persecution and at the same time inwardly rejoicing in the knowledge of the fact that he is doing the will of God. Thus he is impelled to go on regardless of all opposition. Patience results from an abiding confidence in Jehovah. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Particularly from 1922 forward the organization of God’s people on earth continued to increase in strength and in activity. At the present time the remnant of God, and none other, are united in faith, hope and joyful service. These have continuous refreshment from the Lord and may be sure that the Lord will continue to keep his people refreshed and in full vigor for his witness work. It is not numbers that gives strength; therefore the enemy may increase in numbers while those of the faithful decrease in numbers, but the latter will grow stronger in the Lord. The strength is in the Lord and he will accomplish his purpose and continue to provide all needed strength and give refreshment in abundance to his people who love and serve him.

<p><span class="font5">In obedience to God’s commandments bis anointed go forth preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and while so doing they are constantly attacked by many of Satan’s agencies. The occasion for self-examination is needful, that the child of God may be sure he is in the love of God. If he finds himself suffering because of his faithfulness to God and to Christ, and to the kingdom interests, that is strong evidence that he is right and on the right course. Then he remembers the words of Jesus spoken to his faithful ones of the present time, to wit: “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake. But there shall not an hair of your head perish. In your patience possess ye your souls.”—Luke 21:17-19. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">try my reins and my heart.—Ps. 26:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each one of the remnant petitions the Lord to let his case come before him and to give consideration to it and to make known to him if there is anything wherein his child is coming short. Then he presents his case before the Lord for examination. Note that he does not justify himself because of his inward or self goodness. He has learned that self-justification before the Lord is displeasing. The true follower of Christ learns that he cannot bring himself up to perfection or develop a beautiful character that in itself could be pleasing to the Lord. Paul was God’s chosen vessel, and yet he said: ‘I know that in me there is no good thing.’ (Rom. 7:18) There is no pretense that he has developed a sweet and beautiful character. Hence he here emphasizes his faithful devotion to God and his reliance upon him. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In 1918 it first seemed that the work was done; but when it was revealed in 1919 that there was much more to do, and that the doing of it might bring another time of great trial upon God’s people, with renewed courage and burning zeal the remnant have gone forward with the work, determined to finish it, by God’s grace. The witness work to be done is the will of Jehovah God; and his faithful remnant will do it, by his grace, regardless of what amount of suffering and persecution may be brought upon them. Such is the potion God has poured for them, and it is therefore to them a cup of salvation. (John 18:11) Those who refuse to engage in the Lord’s service in obedience to his will thereby wilfully reject the cup which is given to them and which is the cup of salvation for all those who love God.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus expressed his determination to do his Father’s will, fully knowing that when the time should come for him to complete his covenant by sacrifice his death would then be a precious thing in Jehovah’s sight and Jehovah would care for his eternal existence. The death of God’s “servant” is precious in his sight, and no power can end the earthly career of that “servant” until God’s due time has come. The “servant” will therefore not be anxious to die, but will be anxious to give diligence in the performance of his covenant for the kingdom by bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom with joy. No really faithful and devoted member of the “servant” class is anxious to die and get out of the army, but his desire is to render a full account of the kingdom interests that have been committed to his care.

<p><span class="font5">The “song of the Lamb” denotes the song of praise; because the Lamb is of the tribe of Judah, and Judah means praise. “I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.” (Heb. 2:12) Jesus gained a great victory over Satan when he cast him out of heaven, and that victory and the deliverance of the faithful after 1918 are cause for rejoicing and song. Therefore the singers join in praise to the name of Jehovah for what he has done and for what they see he is going to do, and they sing: ‘ ‘ Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways.” It is Jehovah, “the king of eternity,” that sits upon the throne, and his praises they sing. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This prophecy pictures and foretells the remnant, or “servant” class, unharmed though pressed on every side by numerous foes. The remnant or “servant” class see the enemies are numerous and that the fight will continue desperately to the end. The “servant” sees the mighty, wicked host under Satan’s leadership marching to the attack, yet declares he will not fear, because he is in the hand of Jehovah. His confidence in Jehovah is so strong and complete that he is led to say that ‘though war should be made against me, because I am God’s servant, I will not fear, but confidently trust in Jehovah’. He sees host upon host marching against him, and with ever increasing danger, yet in faith and in confidence he grows stronger in the Lord. The servant will not fear, because his reliance is upon Jehovah, who has promised to give his angels charge over the servant at this time.—Ps. 91:11,12.

<p><span class="font5">The spirit-begotten ones are represented as “the sons of Levi” who must be purified upon the Lord’s coming to his temple. He sits for that very purpose. The purified ones would therefore be foreshadowed by Esther at this stage of the drama. The seven maids given to her corresponded to the ministration provided for and rendered to the consecrated by “the seven stars” or angels in the court of Jesus Christ who attend at the temple. ‘ ‘ Their .angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.” After the holy spirit as an advocate or paraclete ceased to function in behalf of the consecrated, then the angels are employed in behalf of those who are being made ready for the kingdom. “For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/31</span></p>

When the faithful members of the remnant detect such they “mark” them in the interest of their brethren, and give warning concerning those who would cause division and would destroy the Lord’s people and against whom the Lord bears the sword. (Rom. 16:17,18; 13:3,4) The remnant also warn the earthly rulers at this time of the falsity, the hypocrisy, and the death-dealing course of the apostate clergy and those who associate with them to the injury of God’s people.

<p><span class="font5">It is the spirit-begotten ones that thirst for the water or truth of life and are always eager to have more. Jehovah says the above words to such. It therefore becomes the privilege and duty of God’s witnesses on earth who are in the “everlasting covenant” according to the “sure mercies of David” to cry out to their brethren concerning the great truths of God’s expressed purposes. They are commanded to say: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” (Isa. 55:1) Those who thus hunger and thirst for the truth have been given a blessed privilege since the Lord came to his temple. They, if alive to their privileges, have been proclaiming God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">Approximately at the time the Lord came to his temple the faithful on earth were put to a severe test. It appeared then that the end of their work on earth had come, and they feared that dishonor would be brought upon Jehovah’s name if they had come short in the performance of the commission granted to those who composed his people. The faithful earnestly sought Jehovah with strong supplications, and in due time were heard and were delivered from all their fears. Their prayers began to be heard and answered in 1919; and when in 1922 they had a clear vision from the Lord that he had much work for them to do, then these faithful ones went forth as his witnesses to give honor and glory to his name. The anointed went joyfully to the task as the Lord had commissioned them. Their fears disappeared and they became bold in the Lord.

(Matt. 24:47) Those faithful ones, brought into the temple, are incorporated into God’s organization and made a part of the ‘elect servant’, because such are in Christ and form a part of The Christ. Such the Lord designates as “the feet of him”, The Christ. (Isa. 52:7) Throughout Ezekiel’s prophecy the Lord addresses him as “son of man”, manifestly because Ezekiel pictures that class which is counted in and made a part of The Christ, who is “the Son of the man”. The man with the writer’s inkhom by his side, therefore, clearly represented the anointed servant class of the Lord now on earth, which class is a part of God’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 99</span></p>

(Heb. 12:27) The temple will remain to the glory of Jehovah God’s name. This is supported by the words: “And I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.” The fact that Jehovah here speaks of himself as “the Lord of hosts” shows that this time of filling the house with glory has reference to a time of war or fight, because thus Jehovah describes himself as the God of battle going on to victory and giving victory to his own. Those who can now by self-examination determine that they are of the Lord’s remnant have no occasion for fear, but every reason to rejoice.

<p><span class="font5">The evildoers and workers of iniquity oppress God’s witnesses and interfere with the wide distribution of the kingdom message. The faithful are dragged before the courts and caused to linger behind prison bars. These faithful witnesses are inclined to wonder why the Lord permits such evil things to be done against his witnesses, and why they cannot get on with the work of preaching the gospel of the kingdom without being hindered by evildoers and lawless workers. The faithful must trust implicitly in Jehovah and do good, delight themselves in the Lord, commit their ways to the Lord, and he will give them the desire of their heart and bring to pass all that is for their good.

<p><a name="bookmark416"></a><span class="font5">These “four beasts” or living creatures are separate from Jehovah’s person, and therefore would not picture his inherent qualities or attributes. Jesus is “in the midst of the throne” with the Father and also in the midst of these four living ones. He is the first of God’s organization, and all other creatures therein operate around his throne. The four living creatures, or living ones, therefore represent the foursquareness or completeness of God’s organization. These are “full of eyes before and behind”, showing that those of God’s organization are ever on the alert, beholding his hand that they may do his will, hence are guided by divine wisdom. Every part of God’s organization is swift to obey his commandments, and every action prompted by love. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 57-59</span></p>

As Jesus said: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” (John 14:15) The anointed ones now see that the great issue is soon to be determined and that, Satan, with his organization, being destroyed, the name of Jehovah will be vindicated. Plainly these see that the commandments of God are: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God. The kingdom of heaven is at hand; go and tell this message to the people. This gospel of the kingdom must be preached to the nations as a witness before the end. The testimony of Christ has been committed to you; be faithful in telling it.’ Those moved by an unselfish devotion to God to obey these commandments prove their love for Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/31</span></p>

By self-examination the servant can determine whether or not be is steadfastly thus holding his integrity. If so, he is in the joy of the Lord and with inherent joy he delights to see the Lord and his army pressing the battle to the gate that the word and name of Jehovah God may be for ever vindicated.

<p><span class="font5">Manna was a divine provision for the sustenance of life. When Jesus was on earth he was the Manna or Bread that came down from heaven. Now he is the divine Bread of life, and, being divine, is therefore hidden from human eyes. Hence the description, “the hidden manna.” He is the divinely provided One upon whom the remnant now feed while in the wilderness condition, and this One is hidden from those who do not love God. This fact he now reveals to his remnant by his spirit and by his Father’s lightnings. “Manna” literally means “What is it?” Many claiming to be Christ’s followers do not understand the meat and drink now being enjoyed by the remnant and ask: “What is it?” It is only the remnant who see “present truth” and rejoice in it. It is because they are faithful and stand firmly. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 27</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the church of God the man represents Christ the Head, while the woman pictures the bride of Christ, that is submissive to the Head. Satan would reverse this rule and put the women to the front. The Lord has declared that no effeminate man shall inherit the kingdom of heaven. (1 Cor. 6:9) This proves that the scheme or habit of paying homage to women is not of God, but from the great enemy of God. It is a veneer of being a proper thing, and therefore it is more subtle than otherwise. Neither the man nor the woman should be worshiped for doing right, because such right doing is their duty.

They pursue a lawless course, ignoring and repudiating God’s commandments. They never receive the love of the truth, have never been in the joy of the Lord, and are not concerned about the vindication of his word and name. They are blind to the issue.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah caused Jesus to speak these words for the instruction of his anointed people on earth after Jesus comes to the temple of God. About this there can be no doubt, because Jesus said: “The Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.” (John 12: 49) Those who are in full harmony with Jehovah are now joyfully obeying this commandment given by Jesus. All those who are so doing form a company (Ps. 68:11), which company is engaging in the campaign to the glory of God. They are engaged in the most important work that is being done on the earth. Those who are associated in this work do not work for any personal or pecuniary gain. With them it is the greatest privilege to engage in this work.

<p><span class="font5">The mystery of God is not the same as the “mystery of Christ”. The mystery of God is concerning Jehovah’s organization and that organization which opposes God and which the Lord will destroy. There are a number of questions relating to Jehovah which were a mystery to God’s people and which have been cleared up since the Lord’s coming to his temple. Who is God? What is the significance of the names by which he reveals himself? Is God responsible for all the sorrows and woes of earth, including the calamities? Has he an organization, and what is it? What is the organization that opposes him, and of what does it consist? All these things God had long ago foretold by his prophets; but the time must come for them to be understood by his faithful people on the earth.

The time would come when Esther must disclose her Hebrew nationality and thus disclose her own identity, but she must await the proper time. That would indicate that the class whom Esther foreshadowed must at the same time declare themselves with boldness as members of God’s organization and that they are a part of his organization, but that this must be done at the appropriate time. The important thing, of course, is to get the message to the people, but in God’s providences the remnant would have to take and have now taken a bold and uncompromising stand on Jehovah’s side that all may know who they are.

Before the final end God will so clearly manifest his favor upon the faithful remnant that this class will easily be discerned and this will be a vindication of his name. It is not for any man to determine who is in that faithful remnant class, aside from himself, but it does behoove every one who is now in line for the kingdom to give full heed to the words of the Lord and to be diligent at all times to keep himself in the love of God, and to constantly manifest his love for God, and to examine himself and prove himself, that he may be sure of ultimately inheriting the precious things promised.

Her refusal foreshadowed similar acts of a company of consecrated ones declining for various reasons to come forward and take a bold stand on the Lord’s side, preferring rather, from and after 1917, to feast quietly upon what they had previously received and which they were having to themselves, and not giving honor to the Lord the King therefor. The faithful ones who responded to the call for the kingdom after the coming of the Lord to Jehovah’s temple in 1918, who entered the royal service of the Lord and who proved worthy and are chosen and anointed for the kingdom, seem therefore to be pictured by Esther.

The creatures making up the remnant know that they could not by any possible means perfect themselves to such a point as would warrant the Lord in placing them for ever with Christ in his kingdom, but that Jehovah in the exercise of his loving-kindness will grant to the faithful such high position because of their unswerving devotion and complete faithfulness to him.

God’s righteous law was written in his heart and he delighted in doing that which would honor his Father’s name.

Instead of listening to the slanderous statements of the enemy, the faithful will turn a deaf ear thereto, and march forward, continuing the work to the end. The Lord directed Haggai his “messenger” to say to the Jews, “I am with you”; and since 1922 God’s people who have really devoted their all to him can appreciate the fact that Jehovah has said and still says to them, “I am with you.” The obedient and faithful ones fully realize the faet that “except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it”.—Ps. 127:1. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/31</span></p>

It surely appears that many have been exceedingly dull of comprehension in failing to see and observe such rule. Their faculties have been dulled by selfishness in the heart.

Christendom’s destruction, and the bringing through the trouble of those millions who thereafter live, will be a vindication of God’s great name.

It is the lawless workers that boast of themselves or their accomplishments: “All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.” (Ps. 94:4) Not so with the approved servant of the Lord. He always says: “My soul shall make her boast in the Lord.” (Ps. 34:2) He learns that salvation does not result from self-development and is not by one’s own efforts.—Eph. 2:8,9.

Every one who loves Jehovah will be in full and complete harmony and unity, and always magnifying the name of Jehovah God and working together to his glory. The Lord advises those who are really his as to what they must do when there are others amongst them who oppose. They are not to retaliate. They are to let them alone, and go on with the work that the Lord has assigned to them. (Rom. 16:17,18) Harmonious action in carrying out God’s purposes through his organization is one of the strong evidences that those engaged in it are God’s anointed people.

<p><span class="font5">Those who dishonor God’s name are vile persons in the eyes of those who love the Lord. No man can be faithful to God and maintain his integrity toward God and at the same time compromise by doing honor to the enemies of God. For this reason the remnant, like Mordecai of old, must take a bold and unbending stand against each and every part of Satan’s organization, and particularly that religious element that dishonors God and defames his holy name. To be called by the clergy and their allies the “uncompromising foe of organized Christianity” is a proper title to those who are faithful to the Lord. Let others compromise if they want to, but let those who really love God remain true and steadfast and maintain their integrity toward him.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah called upon Ezekiel to pronounce judgment against Samaria and Jerusalem. Jehovah likewise directs the Ezekiel class, his faithful witnesses, to proclaim his judgment against Christendom, particularly the hypocritical religion thereof as represented and practiced by both Catholicism and Protestantism. The responsibility is upon the faithful witnesses of Jehovah to declare his judgments. Such is not the judgment of men or the message of men. It is God’s judgment and God’s testimony delivered to Christ, and the giving of which testimony has been committed to the faithful members of the body of Christ, the witnesses of Jehovah on the earth. Christ Jesus the great Judge executes these judgments, and his true followers must make announcement thereof, as commanded, and this work is now in progress. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">VI, 314</span></p>

The running over of his cup indicates the abundance of provision which God has made for his own, and the “servant” joyfully partakes of this provision made. The abundance of food upon the Lord’s table shows the remnant that God is giving his “servant” his favor and using him to his glory. He has permitted his “servant” to look into the temple and see some of the glories of God. Thus the “servant” beholds the table of the Lord laden with precious and sustaining food of which he is permitted to partake continually, and this even in the very p resence of his enemies. Why should not he rejoice and be glad? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/31</span></p>

The signet ring being a mark of identification and symbolizing a pledge of fidelity (Gen. 38:18), it would mean that the antitypical Zerubbabel would be marked as identified with Jehovah’s organization and as having received from the Most High the pledge of fidelity as the representative of his organization. It would also mean that Jehovah has given his pledge to forever use ‘the elect servant’ to carry out his purposes. It would signify that the “servant” would have engraven upon him the name of Jehovah and be clothed with special authority from him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/31</span></p>

This takes place at the time the Lord comes to the temple of God. (2 Thess. 2:1) Prior to that time those who had responded to the call for the kingdom, and had undertaken to carry out every part of the covenant by sacrifice and the covenant for the kingdom, were servants of God. Until chosen, however, it would hardly seem proper to speak of such as members of the ‘elect servant’. Building up Zion (Ps. 102:16) would mean first the awakening of the faithful saints who had been chosen and approved at death. Thereafter as judgment proceeds at the house of God and others are approved they are gathered under the robe of righteousness, taken into the temple, and become a part of the “servant”.

<p><span class="font5">Flesh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom as a member thereof. Nothing will be there that is in the least out of harmony with righteousness. Those who will be there have their names written in the Lamb’s book of life. The names of the faithful are written in the book of life before they leave the earth. It would seem that the writing takes place at the time of the anointing, because that is the official designation to a place in the holy city. It is reasonable to conclude that the remnant of God’s people have their names written now in the Lamb’s book of life.

It includes the invisible as well as the visible part thereof. It is Satan ’s heaven and earth. Christ, the great Melchizedek Priest, began in 1914 the assault on the head and against the entire organization of Babylon, and there resulted a great fall, even a lightning-like fall to the earth; and henceforth Satan and all of his organization are confined in the operation thereof to the earth, and preparations for the great battle of the day of God Almighty proceed.

He desires to know God’s way, that he may do that which will show forth bis praises; and he knows now that he must dwell in the house of the Lord in order to do so.

Some who have consecrated themselves to God ignore this and many other scriptures, and say that Satan has no organization and that we should say nothing about the world. In this they deceive themselves. When one takes a view of the tremendous organization that Satan has built up it is at once apparent that nothing short of divine power can destroy it. The mere proclaiming the truth for a million years would not accomplish that result. The work of the remnant on earth is not to tread the wine-press, but to serve notice upon the rulers and the people that God through Christ will do that work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 342,346</span></p>

Rather should he regard this as a testimony of his faithfulness and that his suffering is for righteousness and he should patiently bear it. In a company where there is dissension let those who really love God take heed to the apostle’s admonition: “Seek peace, and ensue it.” Strife and contention work havoc with those who indulge therein. The Lord has gathered his people into oneness and has made complete provision for their good and provided work for them to do.

It was first thought that the consecrated ones are chosen and anointed immediately after responding to the call for the kingdom, but it is now clearly seen that there must be a period of testing of the candidates after their responding to the call, in order to demonstrate ‘the beauty of holiness to Jehovah’, that is to say, to prove that they are really and wholly devoted unselfishly to God and to his righteous cause. This guards against their being a ‘stench in God’s nostrils’. (Isa. 65:5) Those who have assumed to be so much better than their brethren are a stench in his nostrils.

In 1918 the construction of the antitypical temple began, and that fact is evidence to the faithful that the end is near when Satan’s organization shall be cleared out and God’s people shall be ever secure. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet Haggai. Jehovah now makes known to his people what he can and will do to the enemy, and thus assures his people that they need not fear.

In the past the servants of the Lord have been ill-used and have suffered much at the hands of some wicked men, but there comes a time when many workers of iniquity are agreed upon one thing and that thing is the opposition to the work of God’s people on earth. But this does not at all disturb those who love and serve God. The knowledge which the faithful remnant now have, by the grace of God, gives new courage and strength to them. They see the lawless increasing and the workers of iniquity blossoming, and at the same time they see the Lord’s special protection for the faithful.

She had ‘studied to show herself approved’, by God first, and that she might receive divine guidance and have the favor and approval of her lang. So all those who are in the covenant with the Lord for the kingdom should ‘study to show themselves approved unto God’ and never try to accomplish something merely for a selfish reason.

If the anointed “servant” class does not now diligently engage in proclaiming the truth of God’s purposes, those so acting would quickly cease to be of the Lord’s servants and he would raise up others, because his time is here when his message must be delivered.

These love God because everything he says is truth. They love righteousness and hate lawlessness because God is wholly righteous, while Satan is iniquitous. Those who receive the love of the truth take their firm stand on God’s side regardless of what personal honor and glory may come to them. Such are sanctified by the truth. As Jesus was content to be restored to his former glory (John 17:5), so his faithful followers are content to have whatsoever place God may see fit to give them.

All the spirit-begotten, or spiritual Israelites, from which the ‘elect servant’ is to be taken, are in the covenant with Jehovah by the sacrifice of the antitypical “Lamb of God”. The 144,000 are faithful to the covenant and therefore receive the seal of approval. To the faithful remnant God gives a better appreciation of that covenant, and as a sign of his approval of them God brings them under the robe of righteousness, gives them the garments of salvation and the wedding garments, and thus identifies them with his official organization.

This indicated that the Lord does not arbitrarily prevent one from taking his own wrongful course, but gives each one an opportunity to choose to be willingly submissive. The selfish ones, of course, would call for everything that appealed to their fancy. It is certain that those in the race for the kingdom who are pleasing to the Lord are the ones that gladly accept the provision made for them by the Lord and do not selfishly choose anything for themselves, such as ‘preparing their own special food’ and doing what work they want to in their selfish way.

The vows mentioned in the above verse include both the vow of consecration and the vow or covenant for the kingdom, the condition of each being faithful performance by the remnant. The latter vow requires the creature to bring forth the fruits of the kingdom, and none can expect to be in the kingdom who does not bear the fruits thereof. (Matt. 21:43; John 15:1-8) The paying of these vows in the presence of God’s people means that the faithful boldly proclaim the truth in this day of judgment and without slacking the hand continue to do so until the work is completed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/31</span></p>

The Lord Jesus Christ, having completed the work of preparing the way before Jehovah, suddenly came to the temple in 1918. About four years before that time the shaking of the nations began; and it continues. Christ Jesus is the “messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in”. Therefore Christ Jesus, the Head of The Christ, primarily must be ‘the delight of all the people’ when they know him, because he is God’s representative.

These witnesses are denounced as the offscouring of the world and all manner of abuse is heaped upon them from time to time. But still they go straight forward in doing the work the Lord has given them to do, fully realizing the fact that, in so doing, in the end they will have some part in the vindication of God’s word and name, and this causes rejoicing on their part. That is one of the best evidences that they are in the “joy of the Lord”, and have received the anointing of Jehovah. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">0 Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.—Ps. 92:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this expression there must be something more indicated than God’s purposes as known for the ages and the first principles of the doctrines of Christ Jesus. The words of the prophecy indicate that the “servant” sees new light and is better enabled to understand the purposes of God than at any time heretofore. Since the coming of the Lord Jesus to God’s temple there has been a great revelation to the Lord’s people. Now in the light of further revealed truth the remnant see that the ransom and deliverance of the human race are merely incidental and that the far greater divine purpose is to completely vindicate the word and name of Jehovah through the operation of his kingdom. Now the remnant begin to appreciate more keenly Paul’s words: “0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These scandalous prophets include all who claim to be God’s representatives and who are in fact antikingdom, either in word or in action. Some of them say they are not anti-kingdom, yet at the same time oppose the work being done to advertise the King and the kingdom. Because these false prophets and false Christs are anti-kingdom, God declares he is against them and that they shall not be in any part of his organization now or hereafter. (Vss. 7, 8) They shall not be counted as God’s people, but are counted as enemies, which they are; and they shall die in the enemy’s country as exiles from God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 150,151</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">For what reason “unclean”? is properly asked. Manifestly because of inactivity in the Lord’s serv-ive as the Lord has commanded, and doing work in a contrary way. It was work on the temple that the restored remnant had been directed to do and had been sent to Jerusalem to do. There was nothing else that could be pleasing to the Lord. The Lord had manifested his disapproval of the Jews because of their inactivity. He will likewise show his disapproval toward those who now neglect or fail or refuse to participate in the work of his kingdom when they have opportunity. Those set free from Satan and his organization are called upon to go up and do work in connection with the Lord’s house. Failing to obey this commandment such have not had the Lord’s blessings. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">0 Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast loosed my bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 116:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These words had a measure of fulfilment on Jesus, but more particularly have their fulfilment with reference to the remnant forming a part of God’s ‘ ‘ servant”. They apply collectively, of course, to the ‘elect servant’. God’s woman is Zion, his universal organization. The woman Zion gives birth to the “man child”, meaning the kingdom, and then to her children. The “servant” is the child of Zion, and all the members of the servant class are sons of Zion. Now the remnant see that the new nation is born and that the remnant is truly the “servant” of Jehovah by reason of being a part of the ‘elect servant’ class. Hence the remnant now says, “Thou hast loosed my bonds.” I am not under restraint to the enemy. I fear neither the Devil nor his agencies, because I am in the secret place of the Most High.

<p><span class="font5">It is the servant class that fears God; and all members of this class, whether they be elders, deacons, young or old, male or female, must join in this praise, of service to Jehovah. All the servant class sealed in their foreheads must now do service to the glory of Jehovah God. Jehovah has appointed the manner of giving this praise. He has anointed his remnant to be his witnesses on the earth. No one who is of the remnant is to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, and therefore to think he is excused from active service to the praise of Jehovah because he is “great”. No one is to think he is too poor and lowly to have part in the song of praise to Jehovah. Jesus commands the song to be sung. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 149</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah provides the spiritual food for his people and feeds them upon that which is convenient, that is, upon that which builds them up and makes them strong in the Lord. Foreknowing the crisis would come at the end of the world God has provided the greatest abundance of food for his saints at that time. Wine symbolically represents that which gladdens the heart. At the feast Jesus provided and served the best wine at the last. It is even so now as he comes forth and serves the anointed. An occasional morsel of food or drink of refreshing wine is not sufficient. The remnant find it is necessary to constantly feed upon the provisions God has so abundantly spread upon his table. Thus doing they are encouraged and energized for continuous and joyful service to the honor of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">With the remnant there appear to be times when God and Christ do not seem to manifest any special interest in or favor toward them, and this when the enemy is pressing them hard. Some of the faithful remnant may wonder why God permits the clergy and other instruments of Satan to make such malicious attacks upon them. Even in such dark times the remnant must continue to exercise faith in God and in Christ and to pray for help. Such occasions bring a great test upon God’s people, but they must continue to be obedient to “the higher powers’’, God and Christ, and do so by continually and faithfully serving, and appearing and supplicating before the throne for themselves and their brethren.

<p><span class="font5">One who is in a covenant with the Lord must love Jehovah supremely. That does not mean he is to do injury to anyone, but, with him, to please God is that of first importance. Earthly relatives often induce one to divide his affections with things of this world, which pertains to Satan’s organization, by giving less consideration to the service of God and to his kingdom. They argue that one should not make himself foolish and obnoxious to the world, but should show the proper honor to the world and to men and institutions of the world. Thus they are caused to worship or give honor to the Devil’s organization and are defiled. The faithful 144,000 are described as “wise virgins” who are separated and devoted in singleness of life and purpose unto God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt 1,312,313</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The great crisis has now arrived, and the issue shall be determined now, to wit, Shall Jehovah’s name and word stand firm and for ever, and shall his kingdom of righteousness rule? It pleases Jehovah to now give testimony and warning to the people of his purpose to shortly destroy the “man of sin”, and Christendom, and Satan’s entire organization. He is under no obligation to give such notice, but in so doing he affords men the opportunity to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom, before the judgment of destruction is fully executed. That testimony is now being given, at Jehovah’s commandment, by his witnesses. When the testimony and warning are completed, then Christ Jesus will fully execute the judgment and thus will prove, justify, exonerate and completely vindicate the word and name of the Most High. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 345</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the time that Jesus was required to sit at Jehovah’s right hand and wait, God’s sword was in its sheath. It is his chief instrument for the execution of his judgment against the wicked organization, and the sword therefore represents Jesus Christ. Since 1922 God’s anointed “servant” class has been delivering this hard saying against the controlling powers of Satan’s visible organization, to wit: ‘Jehovah is against you, because you have rejected The Stone, Christ Jesus, who is God’s King and earth’s rightful Euler.’ Against these rulers in Christendom God will now draw out his sword, that is, he will destroy the organization called “Christendom”.

The chief objective of these has been to honor and magnify the Lord, knowing that he could provide for them much better than they could choose for themselves. Those who have had and manifest Christ’s spirit in an unselfish and faithful devotion to Jehovah have found favor in the sight of all God’s household. This favor is not because of inherent personal merit or the development of a character separate from themselves, but because of an unselfish devotion to God and his King.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 34:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unchangeable promise of Jehovah is that the faithful “servant” shall never be forsaken or become desolate. The faithful remnant can wholly and completely rely upon the great Father to bring complete victory through Christ. Such assurance gives every reason for the servant to boast in the Lord. Such boasting does not consist in unseemly language or conduct at any time, but means a quiet and confident rest in the promises of the Lord, causing one to steadfastly maintain his integrity. The “servant” secs the great and final battle between the wicked and the righteous approaching, and knows what will be the result. He knows that, being in God’s organization and maintaining his integrity and remaining faithful to Jehovah, the “servant” is entirely safe and secure from harm. He is thrilled with the entire situation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/31</span></p>

Those who thus show their love for God he never forsakes, but they shall inherit all the precious things that God has promised. Each member of the remnant must ‘cleanse himself from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit’, and he must do much more than that. He must take a positive stand against Satan’s organization and on the side of Jehovah’s organization and joyfully obey his commandments. There is no other way, because that is God’s appointed way and it is right.

<p><span class="font5">Cherubim are officers of God’s organization, to whom is committed the work of executing his judgments. In proof of this note that the cherubim were placed at the east of Eden to execute, and there did execute, Jehovah’s decree of judgment concerning Adam. (Gen. 3:24) The wheels appearing in the tableau represent parts of God’s organization used for his purposes. Fire is a symbol of God’s destructive judgments being executed. The fire was in the custody of the cherubim and between the wheels.

Every one can see and determine whether or not he has endeavored to serve God by joyfully keeping his commandments, particularly to advertise his kingdom by preaching the truth and doing so unselfishly and with a pure heart.

The seventh angel began to sound, and the proclamation is made to the glory of Jehovah. It was at Detroit in 1928 that the remnant on earth discerned and took up this song of praise and began to herald it throughout the earth; therefore those joining in the Hallelujah song must include the remnant of God’s people on earth. Therefore there must continue to be a wide witness to the truth; and the remnant will give this witness. Jehovah is God; and let that now be told by all who love him.

Likewise God’s remnant must tell the people of God’s judgment of fiery indignation which shall shortly be visited upon Christendom, resulting in its complete destruction.

<p><span class="font5">The fact that Ezekiel survived the destruction of Jerusalem indicates that some of the remnant at least will be on the earth after Christendom’s destruction. Ezekiel, by commandment, spoke the word of prophecy, and Jehovah would have that word verified by eye witnesses who survived the disaster upon Jerusalem and who would testify that Ezekiel had spoken truthfully. Thus is indicated what shall come to pass after the fall of Christendom, and thus God “confirmeth the word of his servant”.

Jehovah absolves himself from all connection with or responsibility for wickedness. It is men who have made it appear that Jehovah is responsible for the practice of evil. Men have called themselves by the name of the Lord, and have thus associated their own evil ways with the name of Jehovah and thereby cast reproach upon him. Jehovah never permits evil for the purpose of teaching men the exceeding sinfulness of sin ; but when men insist on taking their own selfish course, he lets them do it.

After Christ came to the temple of God in 1918 he found a company of men and women who had been faithful over a few things (which were all the things they knew to do) and yet they were discouraged. Upon his examination and approval of them he invited these to be refreshed and to enter into the joy of the Lord. They then had a clearer vision of God’s purposes and were refreshed and entered joyfully into his service.

If the commandment to do something is an expressed violation of the commandment of God’s law, then the servant of God refuses to observe or obey that commandment. Those who love God and are loyal to him obey his commandments always. The Devil, through Haman, laid a trap for Mordecai, and doubtless expected Mordecai to fall into it. The bowing down to Haman was a test of Mordecai’s integrity toward God. Mordecai met that test boldly and refused to bow down. In this Mordecai pictures God’s “servant” class on the earth that today, in the midst of all the Devil’s organization, stands faithful to Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “good man” means God’s anointed people acting collectively as his elect servant, and the ways of such are ordered of the Lord. The “servant” does not pray to know what is the will of God, because he hears the commandments of the Lord, knows them, and delights to obey them, and therefore he knows God’s will concerning him. God has marked out the way for his “servant”, therefore the course of the “good man” (or “steps” of the “servant”) is ordered by the Lord, and the Lord does not make any mistakes or miscalculations. He states his rules marking out the way for his servant, and these rules constitute the statutes of the Lord; and his statutes are always right. (Ps. 19:8) The “servant” proves his delight in the way that the Lord thus marks out for him by obeying the commandments with a real joy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">After the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple those who had responded to the call for the kingdom were tested and approved, and were set in a company to themselves, that they might “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”. Then the prophecies began to be unfolded to these approved ones, and then they must, by Christ Jesus the Head of the temple, offer a righteous sacrifice of praise unto God continually. In doing such the temple class must, as God’s chosen witnesses, serve notice upon Christendom of her abominations and of the thing that is coming to pass by reason thereof. The facts must be put before Christendom in order that she might justify her extravagant claims, or else admit the truth and be condemned; and God’s witnesses must serve the notice. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 214</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To make herself ready the church must clean herself up. She must do more than that. She must prove her real devotion to the Lord, that she may have his approval and that she may receive the robe of righteousness and the wedding garments and keep them on. She must be robed properly for the occasion. Her garments prior to this were “as filthy rags”, and she must have a change of raiment, which the Lord provides. This change of raiment and robe of approval the remnant must receive while on earth; and thus properly clothed, she is in a condition of approval. This approval is evidenced by the robe of righteousness received after their being brought into the temple. These approved ones therefore constitute “the feet of him”, the Bridegroom, and they go forth to proclaim the great message of salvation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 155</span></p>

These claim to be feeding upon food which God provided prior to 1917; and while God did give that food prior to 1917, the “evil servant” class give honor therefor to a creature rather than to the Creator, but, in truth, their honor to a creature is another subterfuge put forward under the influence of Satan to insure their destruction, and under such they fall.

These have the testimony of the spirit that they have been chosen and anointed, and they are greatly encouraged now to earnestly seek to be faithful unto death.

He is not abashed in the presence of the mighty of the earth, because the favor of such he does not seek. To him man’s favor is of no purpose. He does not exalt himself in his mind or heart in the presence of the lowly, because he appreciates that everything he possesses is God’s gracious gift and that he is dependent upon God for what he does have. He boasts not in the fact that he has learned the truth at the feet of some prominent person, nor does he give that creature honor and glory who has brought him the truth, because he knows that all honor and glory for the truth is due to Jehovah, and he delights to continue to praise Jehovah’s name.

When a creature is favored by receiving from the Lord the privilege of doing service to the Lord and then fails to show an appreciation of such privilege, or abuses the same, he is certain to lose God’s favor, and the privileges will be taken away from him and given to another. Many have been given opportunities of serving God and his kingdom, and for selfish reasons have abused such privilege and have lost God’s favor, and that which they had received in the way of service has been taken away from them and given to another.

The work on the temple had been renewed and from that day forward the blessings of the Lord should be counted. With reference to God’s temple workers in this day, it was on September 8, 1922, designated “The Day”, at a large assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, that a deeper realization came as to what the Lord would have them do. From that day forward there was increased activity in the Lord’s service, and the manifold blessings of the Lord are to be counted from that time.

While many of the world have been sore oppressed for necessary food, God’s “servant” has been graciously provided with all things needful. Never before has God so abundantly provided for his flock the spiritual food as during the past few years. All of these rejoice that this provision has been made for them by the Lord and they gladly give all honor to the Lord, where it is due. Only the foolish give honor to creatures for the precious things provided for the anointed.

He was willing to wade through fire and death to accomplish that end. In 1914 God set his beloved Son upon his throne and said to him: Now the time has come for action; now “rule thou in the midst of thine enemies”. Then the fight in heaven began; and the victory was with Christ Jesus.

This prophecy applied at 1914, when the Lord Jesus was then placed upon the throne, but applies more particularly at the coming of the Lord Jesus to the battle of Armageddon. Then the crowns of Satan’s organization will be thrown down, and the heads broken.

The “servant” class, therefore, under the supervision of Christ, now seek to interpret and understand the divine law of the great Jehovah God and thereby to be properly advised as to what course they must take today, and in the very near future, in view of the gravity of the situation. God’s remnant cannot follow the course of the false prophet to change times and laws, but must abide strictly by the provision of the divine law as it is written. God has not changed and will not change his decree for Armageddon, nor restrain the enemy from making his assault upon his people; but he will furnish all the needed power for a counter-assault that will completely wipe the enemy out of existence.

<p><span class="font5">Following their release in 1919 God’s covenant people on earth were in a “wilderness” condition for three and one-half “times”, or 1260 days. (Rev. 12:6-14) In that time God faithfully pleaded with his people while in the wilderness condition, that they might discern and prepare for the kingdom service which followed shortly thereafter and which is still in progress. This drew the remnant into a class to itself with the Lord, but at the same time hardened the hearts of “the rebels” and resulted in their being separated from amongst God’s faithful people. Such rebels God declares are not permitted to “enter into the land”, that is to say, into the spiritual blessings which God has provided for his remnant. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 266,267</span></p>

The movements of the enemy are subtle and it is the attempt of the enemy to justify themselves under the law. Satan’s forces include the apostate clergy and those who once had the truth and who later form themselves into the “evil servant” or “man of sin”. Now a climax in the existence of the remnant of God has been reached, and let every member thereof face the enemy courageously and boldly, treading with humility before God and being joyfully submissive to him, and looking forward with complete confidence that in his own good way and time God will provide complete deliverance for those that love him; and this shall be to his everlasting glory.

<p><span class="font5">Putting on sackcloth and ashes and crying out did not mean that Mordecai regretted that he had been firm in his refusal to bow down to Haman and that he was sorry for having been loyal to God. He knew that in doing so toward Haman he was doing God’s will. Now he saw that this faithfulness to God had afforded a pretext for his mortal enemy to seek, not only his destruction, but the destruction of all the Jews. Mordecai then cried for help. Faithfulness to God often brings down upon one’s head the enemy’s wrath, but no man can be faithful to God and thereafter regret his faithfulness. If he is a faithful servant of God he will continue to trust in God for deliverance. Our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us, because he who is for us is more than all that can be against us. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/31</span></p>

God lent the truth to his creatures that they might in turn pass it on to others, that his name might be glorified. The wicked refuse to pass it on. It was Jesus who said that it is more blessed to give than to receive. The man is blessed when he receives the truth, but he is twice blessed when he gives or passes that message of truth on to some other hungry soul, who is also in turn blessed, and together they give praise to the name of Jehovah God. Thus the faithful pay back what they have borrowed from the Lord.

The Lord has laid great responsibility upon the watchmen, to wit, his “faithful servant” class. He makes it obligatory that such shall warn those who start in the way of wickedness. The wicked are not those who never knew of the truth, but are those who, having been once enlightened, to some degree at least, concerning the truth of God’s purposes, have then turned away therefrom and render service to the enemy.

All the facts bear out this conclusion. All this has been the provision made by the Lord for his people. From and after the Lord’s coming to his temple no one could qualify for the kingdom who would fail or refuse to learn God’s purposes concerning the testimony of Jesus Christ and then to joyfully participate in giving that testimony. Those thus doing, prompted by love for God and his cause and free from any selfish motive, would be taking the proper course in making preparations for appearing before the great King.

The paths of righteousness are those wherein the “servant” class walks while covered with the robe of righteousness, symbolizing God’s approval. This corresponds with the “path of the just” upon which the light of God continues to shine with increased brilliancy. (Prov. 4:18) Those who love God with a complete and unselfish devotion walk in these paths. For his name’s sake the great Shepherd leads them there.

His purposes have ever been and ever will be right and just. His announced purpose was to put men on earth who would remain faithful to him and who would therefore do right. Satan the rebel defied God and denied that he could put men on earth who would under stress maintain their integrity toward Jehovah. That defiance raised the vital issue which must be decided right. It pleased Jehovah to pursue a course that in time would vindicate his name, that is to say, that would prove that Jehovah is true, just and righteous, and which would exonerate and completely justify him in the eyes of all creation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 343</span></p>

In the past those in present truth have been considered as like other “Christians” so called, merely religionists in the land.

The new song in effect says: ‘A new epoch has begun; the kingdom is here, and the tried and precious Stone, Christ Jesus, has been laid in Zion and made the chief Stone of the corner.’ He is a tried, precious and sure foundation, and the Head of God’s organization, and all members thereof sing his praises and the praises of Jehovah. All these (represented by the twenty-four elders) say: “Thou art worthy, . . . for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.” Thus the Lord Jesus is identified as the Redeemer and Savior, High Priest and King, and the twenty-four elders are members of his royal line. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt T, 68</span></p>

Rather it means that such are not proud and haughty and do not insist on having their own rights respected. They are not particularly anxious for self-justification, because they desire the approval of the Lord rather than that of any creatures. They are contrite of heart and walk obediently before God, not demanding justice from others, but always rendering justice to others so far as possible; not being harsh and unmerciful to others, but loving mercy and extending mercy toward others.

The prayer of Jesus in behalf of his eleven faithful disciples was: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) The petition of Jesus was that these faithful men should be wholly and completely devoted to God and his service, and that this should be done by and through the truth. That would mean that they must receive a knowledge or mental conception of the truth and that in addition thereto they must receive the love of the truth. This would be proven by their full and complete devotion to the truth because the truth is God’s Word. That would mean that they would be wholly on God’s side because everything he says is the truth.

But God’s faithful witnesses stand true to him and maintain their integrity toward him, particularly since 1922. In that time, under the supervisory direction of the angels of the Lord, they have had to do with the pouring out of God’s vials of reproof and judgment against the ecclesiastics and other portions of Satan’s organization. Not even “for expediency” will these true and faithful ones now be branded with the “mark of the beast” in the forehead or in the hand.

<p><span class="font5">By separating themselves from God’s earthly organization the rebellious elders separated themselves from the Lord. God has not asked any man to organize something for him. He does his work in his own way. The opposers set up their own method of service which exalted themselves and other men and honored the creature more than the Creator, and they put a stumblingblock in the way of others.

Whatsoever gain or prey there was went to the king. This foreshadows that in this day the motive of God’s remnant is not selfenrichment, but their objective is the honor of Jehovah’s name. To the same effect it is written: “And thou shalt devote their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.” (Mic. 4:13, E.P.)

God will not have his work done by those who pride themselves on their own ability to accomplish it. This should long ago have taught a lesson to many of the consecrated that no one can have pride in what he calls “character development” and think he can make himself thereby qualified for God’s use in his kingdom.

When Jesus goes into action against Satan’s organization he bears the title The “Faithful and True’’. Those who are closely identified with him must be like him and bear his name. This makes clear then the declaration of Isaiah 65:15 that God gives his servant another name, that is, the name of the Amen, in order that the people may bless themselves in the God of The Amen. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/31</span></p>

Only by so doing can they be the faithful watchmen. The responsibility is upon the “servant” class to deliver the message, and the responsibility is upon those who hear and who have failed to heed it.

Those who would for ever have Jehovah’s favor are represented by the ones who inherit and dwell in the land. Those of spiritual Israel realize the fulfilment of God’s precious promises.

The Devil has come down to earth, and with Christendom it is a time of “woe, woe!’’ (Rev. 12:12) The unrighteous course of the rulers (“rods” of control) has led them entirely into Satan’s camp, and the fire of destruction is about to devour them completely. Like the rulers or princes amongst the Jews of old, they have not heeded the warning from the Lord. As a vine Christendom has produced no kingdom fruit, and now must go because of being of no use for anything that is good. No ruler of Christendom will be permitted on the earth nor in any part of God’s kingdom of heaven.

Inasmuch as the church is now in the time in which the members thereof have a glimpse of the immediate future, may not the above words of Jesus indicate that the overcoming remnant will be permitted to see Satan’s organization dashed to pieces and during that time and even thereafter have some work on the earth to the glory of the name of Jehovah? The overcomers are also told that they shall have a position of honor with the “morning star’’, evidently meaning with Christ in glory.

<p><span class="font5">There is no intrinsic merit in any offering man brings unto the Lord, and the creature does not make holy or sanctify anything that he might touch. While it is the greatest privilege to be engaged in the Lord’s service, God does not need any of us in his work. No one should feel so self-important as to believe he can lawlessly do works of his own choosing, even though he claims to do so in the name of the Lord, and then expect the Lord to approve such works. The fact that one claims to do anything and everything “as unto the Lord” does not make that thing acceptable unto the Lord, by any means. The scripture, “Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men,” clearly means we must do it in God’s appointed way, and not in man’s way, and that it must be done joyfully to the Lord’s praise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/31</span></p>

God has promised to preserve all who love him, and this he is certain to do. This does not mean, however, that God will spare his children from slander, abuse and persecution. As the Master suffered much tribulation it shall be so with his faithful body members. Jehovah preserved the life of Jesus, raised him out of death, and exalted him to glory, because of his loving devotion by which he proved his faithfulness. He will do likewise for the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Those who love God need have no fear of being the losers in the fight which is now on.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord God himself interprets prophecy by causing to come to pass events in fulfilment of what he has foretold. Until God’s due time to understand prophecy it is not understandable. Then it is first understandable by the covenant people of God who have his spirit. (1 Cor. 2:10) The events coming to pass must be in harmony with the prophecy as it is written, must tend to vindicate the name of Jehovah, and must honor and exalt </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font5"> name and not honor and exalt the name of any human creature. If the interpretation tends to laud and magnify the name of man, then such is not a true interpretation, because it is contrary to the Word of God.

Ever faithful to Jehovah from the beginning, one of the titles given to Jesus is “Faithful and True”. Jehovah appointed him as High Priest or Chief Executive Officer forever and he was faithful to him that appointed him. God made Jesus his chief witness and Jesus has proven himself to be “the faithful and true witness”. (Rev. 3:14) It follows then that no one could be with him in that war except he be “called, and chosen, and faithful”.

It is Christendom that claims the sole interest in that covenant for the crown and for the kingdom, and yet Christendom has been entirely unfaithful thereto. Jehovah has been long-suffering with Christendom, and has not forgotten his word. In 1914, agreeable to his promise, he placed his King, Christ Jesus, upon his throne and he fully established his covenant and kingdom. It is through this covenant-kingdom that the people of Christendom will have an opportunity for the blessings of life.

Their entrance through the gates of the holy city depends upon their keeping faithfully God’s commandments.

Such anointing gives refreshment and a greater ability to serve the Lord. It means the lifting up and encouraging of the servant by the Lord to go forward with renewed zeal. Particularly after 1922 and forward, God’s people discerned that while they had not been pleasing to the Lord in the past, his displeasure was now turned away from them, and this greatly refreshed and comforted them. (Isa. 12:1) Then the Lord began to open to the faithful ones a clearer vision of his purposes, and by this all such were refreshed and lifted up.

<p><span class="font5">Manifestly the sin here mentioned is that committed by one who, after having entered into a covenant with God, then fails to keep that covenant. It is unfaithfulness to God that brings responsibility. The law, or rule of action, must be the same from the time of beginning of judgment at the temple until the end thereof, because God changes not. Judgment begins at the house of God, and must necessarily include the professed house of God, many of whom have made a covenant with God and have then broken that covenant. Therefore each one who has entered into a covenant with the Lord is personally responsible. Since the Lord’s coming to his temple for judgment those who have wilfully committed sin against the light are subject to the judgments of death written.

In all the way God has made provision for his people, and this should now give full assurance to the remnant that Jehovah will continue to supply them with an abundance of nourishing food. The Lord makes all provision necessary for his own. Those who have wandered away from the Lord’s organization have no present-day bread upon which to feed, and are therefore beggars; but those who form the “faithful servant” company are abundantly supplied with food at the Lord’s hand. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/31</span></p>

It insured an impartial judgment of her candidacy without regard to national connections, and strictly according to her individual merits. God is no respecter of persons. This same rule or principle was employed in the selection of the Lord’s goat for the tabernacle service. That selection was done by the casting of lots. This shows the impartiality used in the selection of the members of the bride class and that God and Christ without respect of persons or previous condition select them according to every man’s work.

Christ, with his mighty invisible armies, is marching to the war, and the small division, the remnant on earth, is announcing the approaching battle and singing the praises of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">This does not mean that God’s remnant will be idle and doing nothing, but means that these faithful ones rest in and completely rely upon Jehovah and continue, in obedience to his commandments, to do the things that he has directed them to do. There is no reason to fret because of those who work by wicked devices. To be angered with such is not the proper thing; but with calmness to observe what the enemy is doing, and then leave their punishment with the Lord. Vengeance belongs to Jehovah. He will see to the destruction of the wicked, including the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” Therefore the one who fully trusts in the Lord God has no occasion to fret or worry about what the evil ones can or will accomplish.

<p><span class="font5">It was in the latter part of 1917 or the beginning of 1918 that the conflict arose between those who were in the covenant of sacrifice with the Lord. Like Vashti, those who had not received “the love of the truth” made a feast of their own, separate and apart from those who were really devoted to the Lord the King. This company who had made their own feast with a selfish motive accepted the truth which they had previously received and felicitated each other and rejoiced in the fact that they were standing together as followers and pupils of a man who had been taken away from them. They were not willing to unselfishly be obedient to the Lord’s “lightnings”. The faithful, however, avoided such, and, like Isaiah (6:5-7), mourned until their uncleanness of lip was purged by the Lord.

<p><span class="font5">The request of Esther (9:13) corresponds to Joshua’s prayer to Jehovah to cause the sun and moon to stand still to give time for the complete destruction of the enemy. As Aaron and Hur held up Moses’ hands that the Israelites might whip the Amalekites to a finish, even so did Esther uphold the hands of her brethren that they might make a complete rout and clean-up of their enemies at the royal capital. This indicates that the true remnant will engage in that fight with full faith in God and with a burning zeal, following the Lamb whithersoever he leads, and will continue with joy the work until complete victory is won. They have a special zeal for the Lord impelling them on to fully complete the work God has assigned to them to do and to not become weary in well doing.

<p><span class="font5">The remnant know that the temple of Jehovah shall soon be completed and that its glory and beauty will far exceed anything ever before built. They look at themselves and at one another and they do not see much. They see that the number of zealous workers is small, and becoming ever smaller; they see that many who once claimed to be of the Lord are now actually opposing the work, and these conditions tend to discourage the weaker ones. Jehovah would have such to know that if they will exercise faith in Him they will see the antitypical temple completed and infinitely greater than the typical temple. God is building it, and will make it the meeting place between himself and those who desire to be reconciled to him and live. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/31</span></p>

Then they become persecutors of God’s favored witnesses. On occasions and in order to deceive and mislead and cause disruption amongst the ranks of the Lord’s visible army, these deluded instruments of Satan use ‘ ‘ good words and fair speeches” and by such induce the simple to fall under their spell and away from the Lord. The Lord’s remnant now see “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” made manifest, and by faith, based upon God’s Word, they see the end of him.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has worked or “wrought” with his professed people, and that for his name’s sake. He has been long-suffering and forbearing with them, in order that he might bring forth “a people for his name”, and that his name might be vindicated and honored. Before 1918 the church was not without fault, but the Lord “withdrew [his] hand” (Vs. 22) until the time for judgment should begin, in 1918. In the past his covenant people have not followed hypocritical practices of Christendom with wrongful intent; but their course was not right, and God could not pass it by unnoticed, and in due time made it known to them. This brought remorse and reformation, and this to their good. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 269</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has given his promise that he will preserve all them that love him. That means two things certain, to wit: that the enemy, such as the Haman crowd and their allies, will make a desperate attempt to destroy those who love God, and that God will thwart the enemy in his wicked purpose and bring the faithful through unto victory. “He [shall] send forth judgment unto victory. And in his name shall the [nations] trust.” (Matt. 12:20,21) Seeing now that God is pleased to give this assurance to his people in advance, every one of the anointed should go forward courageously, unselfishly, and with joy. A great event is about to come to pass, and Jehovah’s name will be vindicated. Happy are they that have any part in his service during such vindication. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/31</span></p>

This marking would indicate that the ones thus marked must by some public confession or action take their stand on the side of the Lord before the destruction begins.

No one of the remnant, therefore, can maintain his integrity to God unless he is faithful in giving the testimony that has been committed to the remnant. He must boldly and clearly identify himself as one of God’s witnesses. Otherwise he will not be preserved. He must show that he is a ‘lover of God’, if he would be preserved. The remnant are therefore not in ignorance of God’s purposes concerning them.

The time is indeed short, and there is much to be done. The remnant must be busy. It is a most wonderful and blessed privilege to have some part in giving the witness concerning the vindication of God’s name.

Then he called such into his kingdom and clothed them with the insignia of service in his organization. He fed them upon “food convenient” for them, beautified their hands and feet, and made them “stewards of the mysteries of God” and “ambassadors for Christ”; and anointed them and brought them into the covenant for the kingdom. Thus Jehovah did for those faithfully devoted to him; and thus he shows forth the rule that must govern all who start to follow in the footsteps of Christ, and who shall thereafter be approved by Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 185, 186</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Since the coming of the Lord to his temple the trials of God’s children have not ceased. Some very severe tests have been upon them from that time forward. There are moments of discouragement, and because of some strong opposition or fiery trial one of the Lord’s little ones is led to ask himself: ‘Am I one of God’s anointed or not, or has the Lord cast me away?’ Any examination of self is a good thing and is in harmony with the will of God. If the anointed one thinks of himself soberly as he ought to think and then conducts his self-examination in faith, always keeping in mind his relationship to God through Christ Jesus, then he can arrive at a just conclusion. He may pray that God will take account of the faithful course of action of his child and grant his approval. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/30</span></p>

This is the period of time when the world is seen worshiping Satan and his organization, and the ruling powers are compelling such worship.

The words allow the further conclusion that the remnant will never be incapacitated from doing service to Jehovah. This is a blessed assurance.

If good words to speak cannot be found, then remain silent. Let the Lord do the judging; and in thus doing ‘keep your tongue from doing evil or injury to your brethren’.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s commandment to Ezekiel is further proof that the witnesses of Jehovah, that is, his “faithful servant” class, must pronounce the judgment of the Lord against the lukewarm and the unfaithful and against the mere hearers of the Word of God who refuse to do his will. “Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come.” (1 Cor. 4:5) Now the Lord is come to his temple, and it is God’s time of judgment; and the “servant” class must declare the judgments of the Lord God against those who are disobedient to his Word. This is done that the derelicts may be able to see that their own course reflects that which was taken by their fathers, and that they are true children of their fathers and are naturally filling up the measure of their fathers’ iniquity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 259</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The knowledge and heavenly wisdom received from feeding on God’s revealed purposes disclose to the faithful ones that they are commissioned to go forth as God’s witnesses. They come to know what Satan has been doing and is doing by his agencies, and this causes them to be righteously indignant. (Jer. 15:17) The bitter indignation, however, does not at all take away the sweetness and joy of serving the Lord. Going forth as God’s witnesses in obedience to the Lord’s commandments has brought bitter trials upon them; but in such tribulation they rejoice, because such is an evidence or proof of God’s approval. (Rom. 5: 3-5) These rejoice to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name under any and all conditions that the Lord is pleased to have to come to pass. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt 1,184,185</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The truth which the servant has received is now his means of expressing his joy in the praise of Jehovah God and he wishes others to share with him in that praise. Knowing and appreciating that he has an attentive hearer in the humble one who listens, the servant says in substance: ‘I have learned of the goodness of God, and seeing you are willing to hear, come now and join with me in magnifying his great name. Let us together tell others of his wondrous works and proclaim his praises in the earth.’ Nor does this mean that the humble hearer is called upon to engage merely in a song with his lips, but that he is invited to join in the work of informing others about the Lord and the manifestation of his loving-kindness to the children of men. Jehovah has provided all the means necessary to magnify his name, the message of truth in printed form. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who do right are seeking to magnify the word and name of Jehovah, and in order to do so they will be misunderstood and misrepresented and yet go joyfully on in the service of the Lord. Where there is trouble in a company of the Lord’s people, selfishness is usually at the bottom of it. Let every one put aside selfishness, and peace is certain to result. Those who are diligent to thus do what is right and who are guided by the Word of God pray to God with the assurance of being heard because he has promised that his ears are open to their prayers. On the other side, if there are those who persist in doing injury to their brethren, such are evil; and their prayers God will not hear, but will cut them off even from remembrance.

<p><span class="font5">There is no way for Christendom to be now cleansed except by the fire of destruction from Jehovah. The great God would have cleansed Christendom through the antitypical Elijah-work, but she refused to be cleansed, and the work has failed as did that of John the Baptist toward the Jews. (Mal. 4: 5, 6) The end of that unrighteous system is at hand. Jehovah’s decree is made and sealed, and he will execute it. Therefore Jehovah now commands the Ezekiel class, that is to say, his witnesses, to tell the people that their deliverance draws nigh, and that this will come by and through the operation of his kingdom under Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 329-331</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now the Lord is in his temple and judgment is proceeding. The day of judgment is here and in progress and those who misuse their privileges and who persist in doing evil to their brethren will shortly find themselves completely cut off. The time has come for God to hear the cry of the righteous; hence Psalm 34:17 says: ‘ ‘ The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles. ” It is far better to quietly suffer injustice heaped upon you and continue steadfastly serving God to his glory than to attempt retaliation. The law of retaliation has no place with the new creation. The Lord will hear the cry of the righteous and will hold him in the hollow of his hand, and the shafts of Satan shall do him no injury.

<p><span class="font5">It is even so with God’s remnant of the present time. His spirit in the midst of his people is the power that accomplishes his work. Without his spirit no results could be had. “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.’’ (Zech. 4:6) Approximately 1922 there was a special effusion of the holy spirit upon God’s people, and that spirit has continued with those who have remained true to the covenant for the kingdom. As the Samaritans persecuted and threatened the Jews when rebuilding the typical temple, even so now their counterpart, the religious hybrids and the “man of sin”, threaten God’s remnant and accuse them of all kinds of wickedness. But the remnant have no fear of any of these or of the Devil himself; but, trusting in the Lord, they go joyfully on in the service.

<p><span class="font5">The angel’s crying with a loud voice shows that the servant class on the earth must take up the message and tell it to others. It becomes to them the battle cry mustering God’s remnant on earth together, that they may take their assigned position before the great battle is fought. Their position is in the light and with a clear view of the opposing armies. The gathering is to “the great supper of God”. Therefore it is Jehovah’s supper which he is preparing, and the remnant shall be privileged to partake thereof. The birds are invited to feed upon the fallen hosts of the enemy’s organization; therefore they must represent the Lord’s remnant on the earth. They fly “in mid heaven”, and not low, where the fowler’s snare could catch them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 172</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This cannot mean a malicious desire of any of God’s anointed to have a personal spleen satisfied against the enemy. His desire is to see God’s enemies destroyed, and he properly prays therefor, that God’s name might be completely vindicated; and he sees this desire accomplished, because Jehovah has said to him: “Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked. ’ ’ The faithful shall see the victory and know that it comes from the Lord. Therefore undisturbed they gaze on their watchful foes and continue to hold fast their own integrity toward God and move forward in the work which the Lord God has assigned to them, delivering the testimony of Jesus Christ with joy and gladness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christendom has sowed degradation and profanity amongst the heathen. She, and particularly her clergy and the principal of her flocks, has fraudulently acquired that which belongs to the common people, and has oppressed and continues to oppress them; and has beaten, persecuted and maltreated the people of God, and has brought great reproach upon Jehovah’s name. God’s purpose is now to make himself known and to expose wickedness. If he did not do so, those who flout him and his laws would not be brought to a recognition of who Jehovah is, and would not know that he does not approve wickedness. For his name’s sake he will judge and fully recompense the wicked. His name shall be vindicated. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 294</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Upon every side the faithful remnant see the foes of the truth working in opposition to the Lord. Their activity in no wise disturbs the faithful, because the remnant fully appreciate that if they have set their love upon Jehovah, he will shield and protect them from all harm. The bitter opposition against the “faithful servant” class in the field of joyful work will doubtless continue and increase. But let no one of the faithful be discouraged because of the slanderous speech of evildoers. God says: “Mine ears shall hear thee”; and to the faithful this is sufficient. If some member of the remnant is a special target of these slanderous darts of the evildoers, in all probability that member is faithfully and fearlessly discharging his duty in giving the testimony and this draws the fire upon him.

The “servant” therefore is joyfully bringing forth God’s fruits of the kingdom that his name might be glorified. The more zealous ones now see and appreciate also their privilege of speaking to their brethren and encouraging them to have part in the service of the Lord in bearing the fruits of the kingdom because the Lord has so commanded that this shall be done at the present time. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “servant” class faithfully perform the work assigned to them and, when it is done, in some way make report thereof. That means that the witness work must be done and will be done, and every one who hopes to have the final approval of the Lord as one of his remnant will joyfully participate in the witness or ‘marking’ work. The faithful remnant will fully obey the commandments of the Lord and will receive his approval. This scripture further indicates that some of the remnant will be on earth when the work is done, and will witness Armageddon from their vantage point under the Lord’s protection.

It is but a short time thereafter until the ecclesiastical part of Satan’s organization, including the “man of sin”, will fall and be destroyed; and this takes place before Armageddon. The field will then be clear of this part of the enemy, and the faithful may go on, but the evildoers will not be entirely destroyed until every vestige of Satan’s organization is gone down. Then it can be truly said that consideration will be given to the place of the wicked and there shall not be any. They will only be in the memory of the righteous.

Peace and prosperity among the people cannot come through the League of Nations or from any other man-made peace arrangement, because God has decreed that it shall not thus come.

The union of the Bridegroom and bride would be conclusive proof that Jehovah does have among his creatures those who would maintain and who do maintain their integrity with him, as illustrated with Job.

The reason is, God does not now restrain the work of the Haman crowd carried on in this day. Haman was promoted and then followed his own selfish course, as likewise do the clergymen now. As Haman had the opportunity to demonstrate his true inherent wickedness, even so the class whom he foreshadowed must have the opportunity to demonstrate, and will demonstrate, their true inward wickedness and hypocrisy.

Regardless of how good and devoted to Jehovah any man might be, and how greatly he is used by Jehovah, that is no excuse or justification for another to give praise and adoration and glory to the creature; and he who does so does it at his own peril.

<p><span class="font5">The “servant” class, seeing and growing in appreciation of the Father’s love, prays thus. They are the special recipient of Jehovah’s love; and this is in harmony with Jesus’ words to the faithful: “The Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me.” (John 16: 27) It is faithfulness to the end that proves perfect love. Jehovah declares to all creation his love for the faithful “servant” class, when he says: “In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, 0 Zerubbabel, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">my servant,</span><span class="font5"> the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and will make thee as a signet; for I have chosen thee.” (Hag. 2:23) In the ages of eternity Jehovah God will exhibit to his creation this signet ring upon his finger, namely, his faithful and eleet servant, and thus he will forever show the exceeding riches of his grace to those that love him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/31</span></p>

I have not indulged in the discussion of vain philosophy, nor have I associated with those who cause division amongst thy people and oppose thy organization. I have hated and therefore shun the meetings of those wrongdoers and I will refuse to sit with them, because I have respect to thy loving-kindness. Behold my hands, because they are innocent, and I have not touched anything of those who oppose thy work.

It is manifest that the words here used, “let the sword be doubled the third time,” are used to emphasize the importance of the message and the complete effectiveness of God’s war against Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser’s</span><span class="font5"> rendering is: “And let ‘The sword’ be repeated the third time.” That means, Let the proclamation of the message of the day of the vengeance of our God continue with emphasis until it is complete.

Now the remnant is pleasing to the King, Christ Jesus, bybearing and holding forth his testimony, and at the same time requesting the enemy’s representatives to share in the feast, which shows that there is no secret method necessary in order for the remnant to accomplish God’s purposes concerning them. The testimony is given far and wide and with the announcement that it is done for the pleasure of the King and for the good of the people. The representatives of Satan the Devil hear the message and are permitted to partake of the feast if they so desire.

It is only Jehovah who could create the kingdom and from whom proceeds all power and authority. Inasmuch as he willed the righteous government and its manner of birth, his great organization served as the mother and furnished the material for such government to be born and to rule all nations. God’s entire or universal organization gives birth to the new government, but it is his “elect” servant or great “high priest” that rules. (Ps. 110: 4) The woman of God’s organization therefore gave birth to the kingdom, to those composing the kingdom, to wit, Christ at his resurrection, and the members of his body later, and to the office which The Christ fills. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 235,236</span></p>

The faithful remnant are the only ones under the sun that see and appreciate the entire situation and know how God will bring about relief to the people and how he will honor and vindicate his own great name.

To encourage the people of the Lord the Prophet Haggai makes known that it is not a great while now, but is “a little while”, until Jehovah God will completely clear out the enemy and thus finish the workers of iniquity.

Those who use their money in his work appreciate that to do so is a real privilege. Only those who love God will avail themselves of this privilege. The remnant of Israel that returned from Babylon must have been quite poor, and for this reason the Lord’s word was given to them that they need not fear because of their material poverty. Likewise today, God’s people on earth are quite poor so far as earthly holdings are concerned. They see the financial condition of the world growing worse, many persons out of employment, and distress increasing, and some may be inclined to think they can do no more work or that the work is about done. No one need be disturbed on this account. The Lord’s work must and will continue to go forward until it is completed to his glory.

<p><span class="font5">In preparing for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, Jehovah is using the hand or power of human creatures constituting his “servant” on earth. Not that he needs such; but God will prove thereby, as well as in other ways, that he can put men on earth who by his grace will withstand the enticements and assaults of the Devil, and who will remain true and steadfast unto God and maintain their integrity toward God. This is indicated by the appearance, under the wings of the cherubim, of the form of a man’s hand. (Vs. 21) The cherub stretched forth his hand and took fire from between the cherubim and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen. Hence the form of a man’s hand under the cherubim’s wings seems to say that God has used the hand of human creatures to bear the coals of God’s fiery indignation which the Lord will use. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 125</span></p>

Every earthly tie is broken.

Clearly the lessou for God’s anointed ones here is, that those who are faithful are not to weep or bemoan the fate of the unfaithful. The judgment of the Lord is not to be doubted, questioned, resented or bewailed. His judgments are always right.

In what manner could this witness work be done except by means of the radio and by a publication of books containing the message of the truth?

<p><span class="font5">To be vindictive and vicious in telling the truth would be entirely improper. The truth must be told plainly, honestly and fairly, and without malice. The remnant fear not man, because fear leads into a snare. Their fear is of God, because with such the fear of the Lord is clean, and endures for ever. (Ps. 19:9) The “faithful servant” is directed by Jehovah’s wisdom, and is the only one on earth thus directed at this time. All of the “servant” class now have some part in declaring his judgments. (Ps. 149:9) Because God’s law is written in the heart of the remnant “none of his steps shall slide”. There will be no skidding to wreck God’s organization. The Lord has assigned his angels to safeguard the interest of his people, and they will hold them up and protect them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/31</span></p>

Jehovah’s name must be vindicated, and for that to be done the wicked must perish. Therefore when one knows of the Lord and his provision and then deliberately joins in with the wicked one Satan, refusing to heed the Lord’s warning, he shall be destroyed. The fact that one has been made righteous through the blood of Christ Jesus and the washing of the Word, and has received God’s approval, would count for nothing to offset his subsequent unfaithfulness to God. Everlasting life is granted on condition that one first agree to do God’s will and then be faithful in doing so, first, last, and all the time. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 240</span></p>

Being brought under the robe of righteousness and given the garments of salvation those of the “servant” class saw it was their privilege then to join in the new song. The remnant see it is their privilege to be Jehovah’s witnesses to ‘offer sacrifices of praise to God continually, that is to say, the fruit of the lips, with thanksgiving to his name’. (Heb. 13:15) Appreciating now the privilege of being in the covenant for the kingdom the faithful “servant” says: “I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.” These do not wait to reach heaven to begin the song of praise to God, but do it now before God’s people and before all.

It is not for the benefit of the remnant, but as a testimony to the name of Jehovah and in vindication of his own great name, which he brings about through Zion his organization. For this reason Jehovah refuses to ‘hold his peace’ (Vs. 1) after the building up of Zion in 1918, but, to the contrary, uses his witnesses and their work to his own honor and glory.

<p><span class="font5">It is thrilling and awesome for God’s “servant” class to realize they are permitted to work under the guiding hand of God’s great officers who are invisible to their eyes. This helps them to appreciate the fact that, the “servant” trusting implicitly in God and not following his own selfish course, but being always joyfully obedient to the Lord, his ways are directed of the Lord and therefore cannot fail. (Prov. 3:5,6; Ps. 37:23) These invisible officers the Lord uses to put in the hands of his “faithful servant” class, that is, the man clothed with linen, the fiery message from his Word, or judgments written, and which message is to be used as directed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 119,120</span></p>

The Lord is permitting this opposition for his own good purpose. We may not now clearly see why he is permitting it, but the fact that he does not restrain the persecuting hand of the enemy is sufficient reason to know he has a good purpose in so doing. His purpose may be to permit the enemy to convict himself by his own wilful course in persecuting those known to be doing good in Jehovah’s name.

My foot hath taken its stand on a level or sure place in the congregation of Jehovah, and I will serve him and praise his name for ever.’ The real heart’s sincerest desire of the remnant is to have God's approval, and not the approval of any creature.

This seems to foreshadow that, when the time approaches for the destruction of the Haman class at the hands of the Lord the King, the remnant will keep hands off and will not make any plea in their behalf.

Ezekiel foreshadowed this faithful class. To God’s remnant now on earth is therefore assigned the duty or task of pointing out why the judgments of the Lord must come upon Christendom, and particularly upon the clergy and their allies who rule.

The Lord’s faithful ones see that soon the great battle of the day of God Almighty will be fought and that it is the will of God that before then testimony shall be given, and they delight to have a part therein at any cost. Their course of action is prompted by love for God, and they have therefore received the love of the truth. With some of these faithful ones every earthly tie has been severed, and all of them, like the Master, are hated by every nation under Satan’s control, and yet there is present in the heart of each a conscious joy that the Lord Jesus Christ is leading them to certain and complete victory in the vindication of Jehovah and to his glory and honor. Moved by this, they go on. They have received the love of the truth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 15:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This text would denote that the work that was marked out to be done must be completed before reporting to headquarters. In substance the picture says: ‘The work must be done and those assigned to the work must keep it up until not one vestige of the enemy is left.’ That would mean that whatsoever part is assigned ro the remnant on earth to do, they too must do it, and not stop until the work is accomplished to the glory of God. (Isa. 6:11,12) The fact that God’s people on earth do their part of this work and that the purpose thereof is understood by them is of itself proof that those of the servant class on earth are directed by the Lord through his angels. This fact should be of great comfort to the Lord’s people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Three times (Vss. 9,14,22) Jehovah emphasizes the fact that the vindication of his name was the issue of real importance then, and for that reason he refrained from destroying the covenant-breaking nation of Israel, upon whom he had bestowed such great favor, mercy and love. He had put his name there, and his name must be vindicated. In modern times elders have entered into the covenant to honor God and to do his will; but, being unfaithful to their covenant, they have followed their own selfish way in giving honor and credit to one of God’s creatures instead of giving all honor and credit to the great Creator for the truth he had revealed. God permits such to take their own wrongful course until his own good time to call them to account. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 261</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Truly it must be said that if the Lord had not exercised special care for his people during 1918 and 1919 the truth would have been crushed out of the earth. That was what Satan expected to accomplish. But the Lord had his hand over those who loved him then. He brought these safely through, and then and later has shown how marvelously he has exercised his loving-kindness for them during that hour of great stress. Where there is no real gratitude there is no real love. The faithful now seeing what Jehovah had done for his people in the time of great stress, and how he had again brought them together to engage in his work, made the above exclamation in word and by the course of action taken. These words do not refer to the individual blessings bestowed upon any one, but refer to the benefits bestowed upon the church collectively.

<p><span class="font5">The vindication of the word and name of the King Eternal is the matter of greatest importance. Jehovah pictured the vindication of his name in the hanging of Satan’s representative, the wicked Haman. That, together with the hanging of his sons later, cleared out the last of the Amalekites so far as mention in the Bible is concerned, and thus as God declared it should be. In recent years Jehovah has shown his people that the all-important thing is the vindication of his word and name. For their aid and comfort, and that they might keep bright their hope, he graciously reveals more clearly to them his purposes now, and this must indicate that the day is near when the name of Jehovah will be vindicated in the great battle of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has ordered his sword to be turned or brandished against the gates of “organized Christianity”, and that causes consternation to the enemy. The Lord makes everything ready for the execution of his judgments of vengeance against Christendom, and it will be done in grand style. God’s remnant is now exhibiting the Word of God before Christendom, and is brandishing it by declaring his message of vindication. It is not a rusty or dull-edged sword either, but is keen, thin-edged, pointed and polished and effective. Thus the remnant does a smiting work by declaring the message of truth, and the Lord Jesus does the great actual smiting against Christendom. —Zech. 9:13,14. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">VI, 280,281</span></p>

All of the temple class are therefore in the condition of “the land of the living”. At the present time the remnant is being attacked by the enemy, which is numerous and strong. Desiring to be certain that he is right, and that he has God’s approval, he requests Jehovah to examine him and to prove him to be right. He presents his own case before the Lord in the light of the Scriptures. He sees that he has maintained and continues to hold steadfast his integrity. Therefore in full confidence the servant class says: ‘While I am in the tent condition or temporary dwelling place of earth fighting the good fight of faith and joyfully proclaiming Jehovah’s praises, I believe I shall continue to see the good things of the Most High.’ W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/30</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is all-powerful and his power is always exercised for good. He is the great Preserver who has made provision for the preservation of his creatures who comply with his unchangeable rules. The sum total of the rules of Jehovah is love; “therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” (Rom. 13:10) Those who love God he will protect and save. How may one know that he loves God? The answer is, By keeping the commandments of the Lord and doing so unselfishly and delighting in the opportunity of so doing at the cost of self-abasement. “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not burdensome.” (1 John 5:3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font5"> Regardless of what anyone may say about loving God, he who does not joyfully keep God’s commandments proves he does not love him.

To that end he sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth to be his witness and to bear testimony to the truth and to provide redemption for condemned man. Jesus fully performed the duty laid upon him. Jehovah gave his word that he would take out from amongst men “a people for his name”, and that such people would maintain their integrity toward him under the test, be his faithful and true witnesses, and proclaim his praises; and he has accomplished this and has proven his word and name thereby. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 344</span></p>

They see the wicked organization on one side, and the righteous organization on the other, and are determined by God’s grace to go on in the proclamation of his truth, regardless of all opposition.

Fully assured of God’s protection and preservation, the remnant now rejoice in gladness and are feasting and having a good day because of what they see approaching.

The integrity of such must now be shown.

It shows that the provision for life is never-failing and that there is always an abundant supply. The fruits are borne for the benefit of those who need sustenance. The fruit is that which Jehovah’s servants bring forth to serve to others needing God’s gracious provision. The kingdom is given to those that bring forth the fruits thereof. (Matt. 21:43) This does not mean fruits of one’s own self, but the fruits that God’s kingdom supplies.

It is a trying situation with them, and they know that their strength comes from the Lord and without him none could stand. As, long ago, Esther called upon all the Jews to fast with her, even so the apostle calls upon all the anointed to stand together, pray and supplicate for one another and for deliverance, and then asks their prayers for boldness in declaring the truth.

There are stumblingblocks put in the way by the enemy, and those who go to make up the remnant encounter these stumblingblocks and stumble; but they do not fall down, because God is holding them by the hand and he lifts up his “servant” and the “servant” goes on battling for the kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/31</span></p>

The “seed” which Jehovah promised to set up undoubtedly means Christ Jesus, the beloved of God who was foreshadowed by King David. The King of glory Jehovah now has placed upon his throne. “An house for my name” means the organization of Jehovah of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Chief. That which will lead to the exaltation of the name of Jehovah in the minds and hearts of all his creatures is a knowledge of and obedience to the truth.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is my shepherd. ... He restoreth my soul. —Ps. 23:1,3, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in 1919 that the great Shepherd Jehovah by and through the Head of the “servant” class began to bring back and restore his people to himself and to the fold. Isaiah had a vision of God’s people in distress and almost in despair because of fear that God was angry with them. This depressed and lonely condition had up till 1919 caused even the faithful to become inactive and greatly discouraged. Isaiah then sees the “servant” revived and his lips cleansed with the fire of zeal from the altar of God. (Isa. 6:6,7) The “servant”, collectively, then began to realize his restoration to God’s favor; and the prophet describes the “servant”, meaning all the faithful, collectively, saying: “And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou eom-fortedst me.”—Isa. 12:1. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.—Ps. 45:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “servant” class has already received a like anointing or refreshment because it is a part of the ‘servant in whom Jehovah delights’ and for whom he shows his special care. God has his own channel or means of carrying forward his purposes, and will make known his truth to his people as it is due to be understood. The continued revealment of his will comes to his anointed through his chosen channel and it may properly be likened unto a continuous flow of cool and refreshing waters. The more apt illustration is that of refreshing oil poured upon the head. It is Jehovah through Christ Jesus who thus comforts his anointed and who gives the refreshing libation. Such blessings he gives to those who love him and who joyfully serve his righteous cause. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Esther 9: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately following the decree “to stand for their life” the Jews would be organizing and fortifying themselves for the fight. Likewise now God’s true people gather together to fight shoulder to shoulder in the warfare, and this they do in obedience to God’s commandment. No man can withstand them, because they are his own. Christ and those of his risen body members, and all his holy angels, will do the actual slaughter work of the enemy at Armageddon. The remnant will not do that, because their weapons are not carnal. The remnant has a specific part to perform, and their part is to sing the praises of Jehovah while preparation is being made for the fight and while the fight goes on. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Wait on the Lord: he of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 27:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manifestly Jehovah is pleased with the confidence, faithfulness and steadfastness of the remnant. Becomingly to his majesty and dignity he speaks to the “servant” through the Head thereof words of assurance and says: “Wait thou for Jehovah; be strong, and let thy heart be bold; wait thou then for Jehovah.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> These words bring peace, consolation and courage to the servant class. They are fitting and appropriate at this opportune hour. Those of the remnant therefore see that they are wholly dependent upon Jehovah, and their confidence that they can depend upon him is complete. They know that if faithful to their part of the covenant they shall be for ever in the kingdom, because God is always faithful to his part of the covenant.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And the glory of the Lord came into the house, by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. . . . And, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.—Ezek. 43: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is Jehovah’s name that is involved. He is the One that will be glorified, and this glory of Jehovah will be upon his house, as the prophet Haggai (2:7) states: “And I will fill this house with glory.” With the coming of-Christ Jesus to the temple in 1918 the glory of the Lord does start to fill the house. The temple is Jehovah’s house, and the place of his final residence, because it is the temple class that executes his commandments. Therefore it is his glory that fills the house. (Isa. 60:1, 2) Now “the day of the Lord” is here and the temple is being brought to a completion, and for the encouragement of the remnant it is written: “In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory . . . unto the residue [the remnant, the temple class] of his people.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">0 fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.—Ps. 34:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This promise especially applies to the spiritual food and attendant blessings that God has provided for his own. Jehovah has special care for his faithful ones and he has made all the provision for their protection and blessing. The beasts of the field have God’s care and sometimes are hungry. But the special care of the Lord is for those that diligently seek to serve him, and nothing that they need shall be lacking. The Lord will not withhold any good thing from those who fully trust and obey him. One who fears that by entering the Lord’s service he might be in great physical want for food and raiment for himself shows </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">lack of faith and confidence in the Lord; and the above words should be an encouragement to such. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">~What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.—Deut. 10:12. </span><span class="font5">The “heart” is that part of the creature wherein resides the motive for action; hence it is said to be the seat of love and affection. The “soul” stands for the entire creature, every part thereof; while the “mind” is that part of a creature used to search out the truth of the Scriptures and to consider this together with the facts, arrive at a conclusion, and ascertain God’s will. All these faculties must be devoted to Jehovah by one who loves him. The unselfish devotion to God leads the creature to joyfully do the will of Jehovah, having in mind that it is his duty and privilege thus to honor the great Creator. Love is not a sentimentality or an emotion, but an unfaltering and unselfish devotion to the Creator. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.—Ps. 92:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brutish man is one that is stupid, selfish and carnally minded. (Rom. 8:5-7) A fool is one void of common sense (and is sometimes called a “fathead”) who foolishly goes contrary to God’s law. He refuses reproof and thinks it smart to hide his hatred with lying lips. (Prov. 10:18) He is a perverse creature, morally bad. Such today do not understand what has been brought forth from the Lord’s storehouse during the past few years; while those who are devoted to God and who are unselfishly serving him greatly rejoice because the Lord has made the prophecies understandable. Those who oppose the Society and its work do not understand and cannot appreciate these wonderful truths; and being thus brutish or stupid or foolish, they put themselves in opposition.

<p><span class="font5">The tree does not produce the fruit that it holds forth, neither do the anointed of God produce the fruit that they bear or hold forth. The fruit symbolically represents the refreshing and life-sustaining truths which God has provided for those who love him. It is his fruit, and not the fruit of any creature, but each one receiving his approval must bear or carry this fruit of the kingdom to others who desire to hear and to know the truth. The expression “old age” means that when the fight is completed, and when God’s enemy is driven from the earth, then the fruit-bearers will be in full vigor and in the bloom of youth and strength and will continue to give praise to the name of the great Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let Haman's ten sons he hanged upon the gallows. —Esther 9:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Haman’s ten sons were hanged, probably on the very gallows their father had caused to be erected for Mordecai. Ten being a symbol of completeness, this seems to represent the complete destruction of God’s enemies. These sons of Haman were Amalek-ites, and under Jehovah’s decree all must perish. God’s faithful servant Samuel spared not Agag the king, but hewed him to pieces; and even so now God’s elect servant, in whom he delights, will completely destroy all of Jehovah’s enemies. At Shushan the Jews went after their enemies on the fourteenth day with the same vigor as they had the day previous. They did not balk, kick or complain against “more service”. They had the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. God’s word of vengeance follows the Amalefc-ite until his word and name are completely vindicated. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is Jehovah’s command to Christ Jesus, his polished “Sword”, and to his army that faithfully follow after him, including the remnant, to proceed to the battle, and for each member to do his duty and smite in three different directions, to wit, to the right, to the left, and in front of them, which means, against the three divisions of Satan’s organization. Jehovah brings forcibly together his strength and power for his work, causing all divisions of his mighty army to work with complete unity. There will be no peaceful time until his fury has been satisfied upon the enemy at Armageddon. All the adversaries of Jehovah must go down, that his name and word may be vindicated. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">V I, 281</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The sapphire stone is mentioned as one of the foundation stones of the wall of the holy city (Rev. 21:19), these stones being descriptive of Jehovah’s glory. His glory is reflected upon his organization, and reflected particularly by his beloved Son; and his organization shines by virtue of this glory. “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.” Jehovah’s organization is present everywhere in the prophetic picture, and the throne of the Most High dominates the entire organization. He that sat upon the throne, the mighty One in authority, directs the operations of his great organization. The “servant” class on earth is a part of this organization and in close touch with the Commanding Officer thereof. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">VI, 116</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Isaiah represents God’s servant class, and concerning the above witness work to be done he asks the question: “How long?” And he is answered: “Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.” (Isa. 6:11) The Prophet Isaiah himself did not live to see the destruction of the city of Jerusalem; therefore these prophetic words must apply to God’s servant class whom Isaiah pictured; and this proves that the servant must continue and the witness to Jehovah’s name must go on until Armageddon, when the name of Jehovah shall be completely vindicated. This should not only encourage, but thrill the servant class of the Lord to go faithfully on with the work until the Lord’s due time to finish it. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt I, 186</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has spoken his word and will perform it, and the Scriptures seem clearly to indicate that Jehovah will grant to his faithful witnesses, whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, the privilege of seeing his great “act” at the destruction of Christendom, thereby proving that his witnesses have spoken his word of truth according to his will; and that this he will do before his witnesses are “changed” into the glorious organism like unto that of Christ Jesus. As surely as the witnesses of Jehovah speak his truth, just so surely God will make the people come to know that such witnesses have spoken truthfully. This will not be that the witnesses may have an exaltation amongst men, but that the people may know that God has had witnesses amongst them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">VI, 339</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 18:20, R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The expression of God’s vengeance in the destruction of Satan’s organization will be a vindication of his word and name and call forth rejoicing because of the execution of his righteous judgment. This is one of the Scriptural proofs that God will permit some of his faithful remnant to be on the earth at the time of the complete destruction of Satan’s organization and that these will join in the song of joy. Jehovah God will do the great work of destruction, and not man; but those who love God he invites to sing for joy because of his vindication. In the above verse the words “ye saints” no doubt include the remnant on earth who will rejoice and sing to the glory of God because his name has been avenged. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lt II, 138</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The feast of jubilation of the Jews seems to foreshadow that some of the remnant will be on the earth even after Armageddon, and that they will greatly rejoice because of the complete vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. Also that the remnant will then be used to help the people that have been brought through that terrible time of trouble. The people will look to them for help, and God will use them. Then, as never before, God’s remnant on the earth will engage in “sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor”, for there will be many needy ones then to help. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8J1/31</span></p>

Let those who have the witness of the spirit that they are God’s children and in the covenant for the kingdom, anointed and in the temple, always be of good courage. The Lord knows the works of each one and he is fully cognizant of the attempt of Satan and his agents to destroy his faithful servant. Jehovah has provided an abundance of encouragement for his servant, and those who trust him implicitly and who continue to show their love for him by faithfully keeping his commandments he will preserve. In due time the word and name of Jehovah God shall be vindicated and then the servant will be for ever to the glory of Jehovah the Most High. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5J1J31</span></p>
