<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>PHARAOH AND SATAN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout dll the earth.”—Ex. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S name today is being reproached in “Christendom” more than any other place on the earth. The people within the border of ‘ ‘ Christendom” have been more highly favored than any other people, because the Word of God has been among them and there has been much testimony of and concerning God and his purposes given to them, and it continues to be given. In the land of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ the people have claimed to serve God and Christ, calling themselves by the name “Christian” and claiming to be “Christian nations”. To be sure, this claim is false, but there is a great responsibility upon those who might know the truth and who at the same time have pursued a hypocritical course, and this responsibility is far greater than upon those who have been and are unwillingly ignorant. The people within the borders of “Christendom” are now suffering much inconvenience and great perplexity and distress. The clergy of “Christendom” would have the people believe that God is now causing them to suffer because of their lack of support to the church organizations, which organizations have falsely taken the name of God and his Christ. It is of great importance to Jehovah’s witnesses that they see clearly the situation, the cause or reason for this unhappy condition, and what is the remedy, and then tell others the truth, whether they hear or whether they do not hear. Manifestly such is the will of God concerning his people at this time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In the Bible many pictorial statements appear, and manifestly the reason for giving such is to illustrate to God’s people the unfolding of his purposes. Jehovah used the Jews to make many pictures or examples, and he plainly tells his anointed people that these things came to pass and were recorded in his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Word </span><span class="font5">for their benefit: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” (1 Cor. 10:11) The Divine Record also shows that other creatures or peoples had relationship with the offspring of Abraham, and it must be that such Bible record thereof was made and kept for the benefit of the remnant. This conclusion is shown to be correct by the words of the apostle: ‘ ‘ For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” (Rom. 15:4) The proof is now abundant that we are at the end of the world and that the remnant of God’s people now on the earth have greater light than the Lord’s people heretofore have received at his hand, and this is for the special benefit of those who are now of the temple. For this reason God’s devoted people now receive a clearer vision of Jehovah’s purposes and what is their present duty to the Lord. There would be no reason for recording these facts in the Bible merely for a historical purpose. They are for the special enlightenment, aid and comfort of the remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is given a prominent place amongst the pictorial illustrations of the Bible. Also “his multitude” or official supporters are made to appear prominently therein. The things which the Bible emphasizes concerning Egypt are these, to wit: her political ruling power, which was vested in and exercised by her king and his official family; her religion, which was practiced by the people and in which the priests were the leaders; and her commerce, which was carried on extensively under the direction of the king and ably supported by the great military machine of that world power. These things are made to appear particularly in connection with the Israelites, the descendants of Abraham and therefore the people of God. This indicates that these pictures contain important lessons for God’s people at this present time. Not all, by any means, who claim to be followers of Christ Jesus will learn and appreciate these lessons, because not all who claim to be God’s people are really his people. In harmony with this the apostle says: ‘ ‘ Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel; neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.” (Rom. 9:6,7) Isaac was specifically a type of God’s anointed Christ Jesus and the members of the body.—Gal. 4: 28-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The valley of the Nile is very rich land, and the waters of the river cause the land to produce an abundance of things necessary for the support of the inhabitants of that land. The waters of the river furnished a way of commerce. The waters of the river symbolically represent the people which the official element exploits and uses for its purpose. That the king of Egypt claimed to be the absolute ruler is evidenced by the statement that “Pharaoh [the] king of Egypt . . . hath said, Aly river is mine own, and I have made it for myself”. (Ezek. 29:3) All of the other supporting factors that had to do with the rule of Egypt performed their duties subject to the wish of the king. Egypt became a world power, which, of course, means that Pharaoh the king and his supporting officers ruled and dominated the world. The king of Egypt is likened by the Scriptures unto ‘ ‘ a young lion”, symbolically meaning that he was regarded by himself and his people as a mighty, strong and powerful one. (See Ezekiel 32:2.) As the lion is the king of the forest, so this beastly rule in Egypt was presided over by a specifically strong ruler.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">103</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The religion of Egypt was devilish, and hence anti-God. This is made certain by the declaration of Jehovah just preceding the exodus of the Israelites. “Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment.” (Ex. 12:12) The political powers were against Jehovah God, and henee the instrument of the Devil, and this is evidenced by the words of Pharaoh, who said: “Who is the Lord [Jehovah], that I should obey his voice ? ’ ’ The priests that practiced the false or Devil religion ate out of the hand of the king, showing that the king was really the one who made provision for the religious practices and practitioners.—Gen. 47: 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> The commerce was the stronger factor of the Egyptian world power. That means that Egypt pursued a policy of acquiring property, regardless of whether it was done by right or by wrong methods; that such was the chief business of Egypt; and that other portions of the governmental organization were subsidiary to the commercial part thereof. To support and carry on her great commerce and commercial schemes a mighty army, or military wing of the government, was provided. The king had a host of chariots and horses to draw them for war purposes. “Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines. Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.” (Jer. 46: 4, 8, 9) The Ethiopians, the Libyans and the Lydians were the allies of Egypt. They resided near the border of Egypt and supported Egypt in her conquests or wars for the acquisition of property. The Egyptians built great treasure cities, which is proof that they were great builders and that the nation employed architects and scientific constructors to further enhance their commercial power. It was the desire of the nation to acquire greater wealth without giving anything in exchange therefor that led Egypt to make slaves of the Israelites and to co'mpel that people of the Lord to build their treasure cities. —Ex. 1:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> It thus clearly appears that the entire nation of Egypt, that is to say, Pharaoh the king, the religious element, led by the priests, and the commercial element, which maintained a military, were all against God and against the people of God. Egypt was a wicked, cruel and oppressive power, and yet it is written in the text first above quoted that Jehovah said of her king: “And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DEVIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> There can be no doubt of the fact that Jehovah caused his record to be made concerning Egypt and her king Pharaoh and his multitude for the purpose of picturing or illustrating the Devil and his wicked and oppressive organization. The Hebrew word for Egypt is Mizraim, meaning “an encloser of the sea”. The sea symbolically pictures the human race alienated from God. (Rev. 13:1; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 259.) Pharaoh the king of Egypt was a shepherd of his own organization, and thus he pictured Satan, who shepherds and looks after his own wicked organization. The human race, symbolized by the sea, alienated from God, was banked up and turned into wrong channels for the benefit of Satan’s commercial element in particular and to make strong Satan’s organization in general. The prophet, referring to Mizraim (Egypt), calls it the “land of traffic” and “a city of merchants”.—Ezek. 17:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Concerning Satan it is written: “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned; therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.” (Ezek. 28:16) It seems certain that Satan began his sin by the desire for merchandise, that is to say, to possess Adam and Eve and all that would come from them. As Lucifer, having jurisdiction over Eden, he foresaw the vast earthly sea of humanity which would flow from Adam and Eve and fill the whole earth, and his covetous desire to possess that “sea” found a place in his heart and led him to his wrongful course. ‘ ‘ 0 thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.”—Jer. 51:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> That covetousness led Satan to violence, and hence God says of him that by the multitude of his merchandise he has filled himself and his organization with violence. Satan alienated Adam and Eve from God. In order, then, to deceive the people and alienate them from God he established a false and wicked religion with Nimrod as the visible leader thereof. He introduced his false religion amongst the Egyptians to turn that people away from God, and then he built a great commercial and military power and compelled the people to support his commerce and commercial schemes and thereby induced them to believe that commerce would bring a satisfaction of their selfish desires. The commercial part of Satan’s organization has been the real means of filling the earth with violence and of bringing great woe and oppression upon mankind. Militarism was necessary to carry forward the selfish and covetous desires and schemes of wicked commerce, and hence the great war equipment was brought into play and has been ruthlessly used by selfish men. All the wars of conquest have originated and been carried on by men with covetous hearts who willingly and deliberately resorted to all manner of violence for the purpose of enriching themselves. The kings and other rulers have hired their fighting men to do their brutal and cruel wont, and gold has been the means of inducement for men thus to hire themselves to indulge in willful murder. The real cause for so much violence, therefore, has been the covetous spirit of acquiring that which belongs to another. “For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.” (Mic. 6:12) “Therefore pride compasseth thrni about as a chain; violence eovereth them as a garment. Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.”—Ps. 73:6,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The ecclesiastical name for Egypt means ‘ ‘ proud ’ The clergy have pointed with great pride to the rich and powerful nations of the world, and particularly of “Christendom”, which nations have made themselves rich by conquest and by commercial schemes that have exploited and robbed the people. It is not unusual to hear clergy and politicians boast of the greatness of these countries that have grown great at the expense of the common people that really produce the wealth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The Devil has builded on the earth a powerful organization, the chief elements thereof being religious, commercial and political. He uses selfish men to form his visible organization and carry forward his wicked and oppressive purposes. It is Satan who says of and concerning the people symbolized by the river: “My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself.” (Ezek. 29:3) For a long while the entire world has been under the wicked one; as it is written: ‘And the whole world lieth in the wicked one.’ (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font5"> Satan thus claims that the peoples of earth are his own and that hence his rule is of right, and he is the god of this world. (2 Cor. 4:4) His visible political representatives act at his instance and under his subtle direction. He causes the people to practice a false religion that they may be kept in ignorance of Jehovah God and alienated from him, the true God. The most powerful part of his organization, however, is the commercial wing thereof, the part that he uses to exploit, rob and oppress the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Satan’s selfish agents today control practically everything in the world, both upon the seas and upon the land. These selfish and cruel agents, who operate and carry on their selfish schemes, we call “Big Business”, because it has to do with the big things of the commerce of the earth. Big Business owns the ships that ply the seas; it owns and controls the waterways, the railways, and all other means of carrying the products and merchandise of the earth. Big Business owns and controls all the means of communication between the nations and peoples of earth; it owns the banks and almost all the money therein; it owns and controls the food supply, the manufacturing interests, the machines that manufacture the raw materials; and it fixes the price of the product of the farm and the shop and compels the ordinary buyer and seller to do whatsoever Big Business says they must do. Big Business owns and controls the newspapers, the magazines, and all other means of carrying on its propaganda work to advertise itself. It owns and controls the law-making and the law-enforcement branches of the government. It owns and controls the colleges and universities, the places of technical learning, the engineers and the builders, and it owns and controls the major portion of the real estate. It has made slaves of the common people, and Big Business gives no heed to the peoples’ cry for mercy and for relief. Big Business owns the religionists, the politicians, and their hangers-on who do the bidding of Big Business; and the common people find no means of relief. The Devil, therefore, has the most powerful organization ever visible to human eyes. If Egypt and her king pictured Satan and his organization, and there can be no doubt about that fact, then it was concerning Satan and his organization that the words were written: “And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> It is according to the will of God that men on earth engage in necessary, and hence legitimate, barter and trade in buying and selling that which is necessary to be exchanged amongst the people; but such buying and selling must be done in honesty and in full regard for the rights of each other. The Jewish people were in covenant with Jehovah and therefore agreed to do the will of God, which means that they were duty-bound to do right and to treat their neighbors right and, of course, to treat each other right. The clergy of that nation became the tools of the Devil; and they fell away to the commercial spirit, and the Devil turned the house of God into a house of merchandise or a house of thieves. The Devil knew that he could get the clergy in that very way, and he did it. For this reason Jesus spoke so emphatically to them when he came to cleanse the temple: ‘ ‘ And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.” (John 2:16) “And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. ’ ’—Matt. 21:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The true rule of barter and trade Jesus announced in these words: “Good measure, pressed down, and shaken together.” (Luke 6:38) The rule that the commercial wing of Satan’s organization has invoked is exactly contrary to that righteous rule and is: “ Get all you can, and give as little as possible for what you get. Get it by fair or foul means, but get it. ’ ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Some whom the Lord has favored by giving them a knowledge of the truth have been overreached by the commercial spirit and have fallen away to the influence thereof and have been ‘drowned in the sea’. The apostle wrote to the church upon this very matter and said: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. ’ ’—1 Tim. 6: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Some have thought that they could go on acquiring wealth by the same methods that Big Business employs and still get into the kingdom of God; but such a thing is an absolute impossibility. “For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” (Luke 18:25) These words of Jesus cannot be properly applied merely to a small gate into the wall of Jerusalem, but mean exactly what they say. Any man who resorts to Big Business methods could not possibly be in God’s kingdom. Anyone at this time who has received from the Lord the privilege of serving him and who then of his own volition turns aside from that service for the mere purpose of engaging in commercial pursuits to enrich himself by acquiring money and property shows that he does not appreciate the kingdom nor does he appreciate the fact that the kingdom is here. Following such a course would prove that such a one does not love God and his kingdom, and hence he would not be permitted to enter into and become a part of that kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WICKEDNESS PERMITTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is just and righteous, and all of his ways are right. He is entirely unselfish, and therefore God is love. “The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.” (Ps. 19:8) “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works arc done in truth.” (Ps. 33:4) Jehovah God loves righteousness and hates iniquity. “For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.” (Ps. 11:7) “Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.” (Ps. 116:5) “These six things doth the Lord hate; yea, seven are an abomination unto him: a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.” (Prov. 6:16-19) All of these wicked things, which God hates, Satan has done and continues to practice. His representatives in his organization do likewise.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The Egyptians oppressed God’s chosen people. Satan and his organization have oppressed God’s people and greatly reproached Jehovah’s name. For more than six thousand years Satan has exploited and oppressed the people, and now at the present day his wickedness and the wickedness of his earthly agents exceed anything of gross wickedness and oppression that has ever been known. When we now attempt to tell the people about the relief that God will bring by his kingdom, naturally they ask: “If Jehovah is the God of righteousness, then why does he permit all this wickedness in the earth? Why does not God kill the Devil? and why didn’t he kill him long ago? And why does God permit Big Business, false religion and conscienceless politicians to exploit and rob and oppress mankind? Does not the Word of God say that God raised up Satan and Pharaoh? And why has he done so? Why should he want these wicked ones operating?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The answer to these questions has been, in substance, this: That Jehovah God so manipulated the dynasty of kings coming to the throne of Egypt that this particularly wicked Pharaoh might come at a time when his people were there, so that this wicked Pharaoh might oppress them and teach the Jews lessons; and that for a like purpose God raised up the Devil and permitted him to carry on his wickedness, for the purpose of teaching all creation the exceeding sinfulness of sin; that God permitted the wicked Israelites and the good Israelites to grow up together until his due time to destroy those who were fit vessels of wrath and to save the others. Also that God has permitted the wicked to grow up and oppress the good people until his own due time to gather the good unto himself, teaching them proper lessons, and then destroying the others. If that answer is correct, then God is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">party to the wickedness in the earth and to the oppression that is now being inflicted upon the people. We know that such a conclusion could not possibly be correct, because God is righteous and hates the wicked, and all his ways are right.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TRUE ANSWER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The correct answer to the above questions can be had only after we have seen the great issue or question for determination. Jehovah God did not make or raise up the Devil, nor did he make or raise up the wicked Pharaoh of Egypt. Lucifer was created perfect and was installed by the Lord in a position of responsibility. His covetous spirit led him to rebel against God. His desire for merchandise, that is to say, his selfish desire to make commerce of the human race, was the beginning of his wickedness. Lucifer declared God to be a liar, hence put at issue the truthfulness of God’s Word. God then named him (Lucifer) Serpent, meaning that he is a liar and a deceiver; he called him Devil, meaning that he is a slanderer and therefore a liar and the teller of lies; he called him Dragon, which means that he is a devourer or destroyer of that which is good; and he called him Satan, which means he opposes everything righteous and is therefore the opposer of Jehovah. Satan then defied Jehovah God to put a man on earth who would maintain his integrity toward God and remain true and faithful to him under the most adverse conditions. (Job 1:10,11; 2:4-7) Thus he raised the issue of ‘Who is the supreme one of the universe?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The name of Almighty God and Most High stands for true righteousness, for truth, justice, wisdom, love and power. His name means that he is above all, over all, and that all his acts are prompted by unselfishness, and his loving-kindness is toward all that do right. Therefore the controversy involved the name of Jehovah God. Had God then and there killed the Devil, no opportunity would have been afforded to fully prove the question that the Devil had raised, or to prove that the name of Jehovah stands for all that is claimed for it and that it is. God therefore permitted Satan to take his own selfish and wicked course, and has permitted him to go the very limit therein and until God’s due time to demonstrate to all creation that God is almighty, the Supreme One, and that his name stands for truth and righteousness, justice, wisdom, love and power. Pharaoh was an illustration of, and stood for and in the place of, the Devil; and therefore God spoke to Moses, and his words concerning Pharaoh apply more specifically to Satan the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> When men translated and published the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font5"> of the Bible they evidently thought and believed that God had made Satan the wicked one, and that his wickedness would be a means of teaching good lessons to some; and that then those who would not learn, the Devil would take off to his abode and torment them forever; and hence they rendered the text in these words: ‘ ‘ And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up. ’ ’ They were not satisfied with their own translation of it, however, and they placed in the margin the more literal rendering of the text in these words: “And in very deed for this cause have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I made thee stand.”</span><span class="font5"> Otherwise stated, it means that the issue must be properly and for ever settled after full opportunity is given the Devil to prove his case; and therefore saith the Lord, ‘For that purpose I have permitted you to stand.’ This conclusion is more fully supported by other authorities who have rendered the text, as follows:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> For the aid of the student in arriving at the correct conclusion the following various translations of this text, Exodus 9:16, are here set forth, to wit: ‘ ‘ But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’’ (A.E.V.) “But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, for to shew thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(E.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> “But in very deed for this purpose have I let thee remain, for the purpose of showing thee my might, and that my name may be celebrated in all the earth.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font5">“But thou hast been preserved for this purpose that by thee I might display my power and that my name may be celebrated throughout all the earth.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Sept.) </span><span class="font5">‘ ‘ But for this- cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”— </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> These texts settle the question beyond any doubt and prove that God did not raise up the Devil, nor did he raise up Pharaoh, the wicked king of Egypt. A statement to that effect by the clergymen, or by anyone else, is a defamation of God’s name and charges God with being responsible for the gross wickedness and great oppression that now afflicts the human race. God has kept his restraining hand off the Devil, however, and has permitted him to remain, and thus to be preserved from destruction, for His own purposes which shall be executed in his own good time and to his own honor and glory and to the complete vindication of his name. Let those who love the Lord ever keep in mind that the most important question now, or that ever was for determination, is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The time draws near when he will vindicate it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The Devil built Egypt, and Pharaoh represented the Devil. God sent his chosen people to Egypt, that is to say, into the world or the Devil’s organization, because out of the world in due time he would take his anointed ones. His people being in Egypt, there the divine picture began with the wicked Pharaoh and his multitude oppressing the Israelites. Pharaoh and his multitude pictured Satan and his organization. The Israelites in Egypt pictured all of the people who are under the hand of Satan who are oppressed and who are of good will, and who desire to be relieved from such oppression and to learn righteousness. God heard the cries of the Israelites and sent Moses to deliver them, and it is written that the purpose of sending him was to make a name for Jehovah. “Whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name. ” (2 Sam. 7:23) Moses in performing this work was a type of Christ Jesus, whom God sends to the world to redeem and to deliver his chosen people and to make a name for himself. Moses was accompanied by Aaron; and these men appeared before Pharaoh to serve him with notice of God’s purpose before the destruction fell upon the Egyptians. To Christ Jesus is committed the testimony of Jehovah </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">make known to Satan and his organization his will and his purposes before destruction falls upon them. After due notice God delivered his chosen people from Egypt and destroyed Pharaoh and his army in the sea; and in this he made a picture to the effect that, after God has caused due notice and warning to be given to Satan and his organization, he will destroy that wicked one and his organization and deliver the peoples of good will from under its oppressive power and hand.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> God commanded Moses to say to Pharaoh: “But for this cause I have allowed thee to remain.’’ For what cause? “In order to show thee [that is to say, Pharaoh and his multitude, foreshadowing Satan and his organization] my power; and in order that they [my people] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Leeser) This identical text is quoted by the apostle in Romans 9:17, and there appear these words: “That I might show my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> That the above text applies chiefly to Satan and his organization, and that Pharaoh is merely a picture, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">apostle shows by his further statement: “What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?” (Rom. 9:22) </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">We know </span><span class="font5">that God did not endure Pharaoh for any great length of time. It was only a short time, and then Pharaoh died. But God did endure and has endured Satan and his wicked organization for many long centuries and that wickedness continues to grow worse even after repeated warnings given by Jehovah’s witnesses. At the present time Satan’s organization has reached its very zenith in wickedness; and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">we know </span><span class="font5">from the Scriptures that within a short time God will kill Satan and destroy his organization, and this he will do at Armageddon. Then at the end of the Millennial Age he will completely and for ever wipe out Satan. Satan and his organization, including his chief visible elements, to wit, religious, commercial and political, constitute the oppressors and are “vessels of wrath fitted to destruction”. God has endured these for a long time and with much long-suffering and has emphatically declared in his Word that they shall be destroyed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>29</sup> These </span><span class="font5">scriptures show beyond all question of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">doubt </span><span class="font5">that Jehovah God is not at all responsible for the wickedness in the earth and that he has not per</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mitted </span><span class="font5">this evil or wickedness to the end that men thereby might be taught lessons to their profit and might learn the exceeding sinfulness of sin. No crea</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ture </span><span class="font5">ever learned any profitable lesson by practicing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sin or </span><span class="font5">wickedness. The Scriptures do show conclusively that God has kept his hand off the wicked one and thus permitted him to remain, until his own due time to settle for ever the issue of his name, which stands for his supremacy, his unlimited power, his absolute justice, his entire unselfishness, and his perfect wisdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> When confronted with the question as to why all this wickedness and oppression of the human race has been and is permitted we may answer it, in brief, in this manner: Satan the Devil is responsible for all this trouble and oppression. For centuries he has attempted to turn all mankind away from God, and for that purpose he has builded a great organization which consists of false religionists and false religion, faithless politicians or rulers, and a great and oppressive commercial business called “Big Business”; and by these things Satan has oppressed mankind and has made slaves of them, even as Pharaoh made slaves of the Israelites in Egypt. God heard the cries of the oppressed Israelites, and now he has heard the cries of the oppressed peoples of the world, and he will act. Long ago Jehovah told his people that in these last days, where we now are, a great climax would come, in which the wicked one and his organization would be exposed and destroyed. He caused his faithful witness, and apostle of Jesus, to write concerning Satan’s wicked organization, and specifically links together the hypocritical religion, Big Business or commercial organization, the mighty wealthy power, and the conscienceless politicians, all of which together rule and oppress mankind. Concerning this unholy combine the apostle wrote: “ Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Yc have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.? (Jas. 5:1-6) The God of Sabaoth, meaning the God of battle, will now respond to the cries of the persecuted and oppressed and will send Christ Jesus and his mighty army to destroy Satan and his organization, because such arc vessels of wrath fitted for destruction.—Rom. 9: 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECLARING HIS NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Just now the particular work for the anointed remnant of God is the ‘declaring of God’s name throughout all the earth’. Moses was accompanied to Egypt by Aaron, who was made the spokesman by the direction of the Lord. (Ex. 4:14,15) “And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Hoses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.” —Ex. 4:30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">”In like manner Jesus Christ has committed the testimony to his faithful remnant on earth, whom Aaron pictured, and God has commanded that this testimony must he given, the giving of which testimony makes Satan the old Dragon very mad. (Rev. 12:17) Satan and his great commercial organization, or Big Business, is pictured by the Lord’s Word as a dragon, a crocodile in the rivers. (Ezek. 32:2) Clearly, then, this means that Jehovah’s witnesses must tell to the people the truth of and concerning Satan’s organization, and particularly must tell them about Big Business’ being the creation and tool of Satan, used to oppress mankind and to tu rn the people away from God. There are those who claim to be in a covenant with God to do his will and who refuse to say anything about Satan’s organization. None of the anointed can be faithful to God and fail or refuse to obey his commandments; and his commandments to them are that they must ‘declare the day of the vengeance of our God’, and his vengeance is against Satan’s organization, which he will now destroy. (Isa. 61:1,2) This gospel must be told to the nations.— Hatt. 24:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> The words of Jehovah addressed by Moses to Pharaoh mean that God has kept his hands off the wicked one until his due time, “that my name may be declared throughout all the earth”; and this declaration of his name must be made before the wrath of God destroys that wicked one and his organization. Who, then, will declare the name of Jehovah? His witnesses, to be sure. God’s remnant now on the earth constitute the people referred to in the scripture which says: ‘God at first did visit the nations to take out of them a people for his name. And ... I will build up the tabernacle of David.’ (Acts 15:14-18) God has now taken out of the world a people for his name, and these faithful ones he has brought into the temple of Christ, foreshadowed by David and his tabernacle, and has anointed them and constituted them as his witnesses to declare his name. This is supported by the apostle’s statement: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.” (1 Pet. 2:9,10) The remnant are now God’s chosen nation who must represent him and keep themselves entirely separate and aloof from every part of Satan’s organization.—Jas. 1:27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> The great climax has now been reached. God has permitted Satan and his organization to remain or continue in wickedness until his due time to destroy them, and now, just before destroying them, he says: ‘Let the people be assembled, and let Satan’s crowd tell them, if they can, what these things mean, and, they failing, let the people hear the truth at the mouth of my witnesses and admit it is the truth.’ Then to his faithful witnesses he says: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God.’ (Isa. 43:10,12) Jehovah God has made known to his anointed ones in advance what these scriptures mean and thus affords them an opportunity to appreciate why he has called them out of darkness into the marvelous light and has put his &quot;Word in their mouth. He shows them clearly and fully that God is everything that his name implies; that he has not permitted wickedness in order to teach men the exceeding sinfulness of sin, but that he has permitted the wicked one and his wicked organization to go on until the time comes for him to show the people the truth, and that his name might be known in all the universe. This is supported by the statement repeatedly made in the prophecy of Ezekiel in particular, and in other places, to the effect that God will express his vengeance against Satan and his organization and “they shall know that I am the Lord”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> God caused Moses and Aaron to appear before Pharaoh and give him full notice. He caused the various plagues to come upon the Egyptians as a notice and warning to the nation of Egypt of his purpose to destroy that wicked organization, and to inform them, above all things, that he (Jehovah) is supreme. In this Moses and Aaron p'.eiured The Christ, including the feet members or remnant now on the earth, giving notice and warning to Satan and the various divisions of his organization that Jehovah is supreme, and that his purpose is to destroy the Devil and all who join him in opposition to God. The plagues upon Egypt foreshadowed the warning and notice that God has been and is now giving the nations of the world, and particularly Satan’s official organization, which is reproaching Jehovah’s name and opposing his witnesses in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses must now be up and doing. They must be diligent in giving the testimony of Jesus Christ that has been committed unto them concerning God and his kingdom. In obedience to God’s commandment they must give the warning and “cry aloud, spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins”. (Isa. 58:1) This means that they must warn those who claim to be followers of Christ and of God’s house of sons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3T</sup> All those who have been enlightened with a knowledge of God’s purpose to redeem man by the blood of his beloved Son Christ Jesus, to set up his kingdom with Christ as the Head thereof, and then to restore the obedient ones of mankind, and of his purpose to destroy the wicked, and who then willingly oppose Jehovah’s witnesses in giving the testimony concerning Jehovah and his purposes, are certain to be destroyed with Satan, because they are sinning against light. Let all, then, who oppose Jehovah’s witnesses in giving the testimony of God’s kingdom now take warning that God’s judgment is written against the wicked and will shortly be executed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> No one who has received a knowledge of God’s purposes, and hence a knowledge of present truth, and then fails or refuses to participate in giving the testimony to the name of Jehovah, could possibly be of the kingdom of God. Let all lukewarm and negligent ones, and who are indifferent, take warning. The time is here in which God will have his name proclaimed; and in order for his anointed to maintain their integrity, and prove their faithfulness and love for Jehovah, they must and will proclaim his name. All shall know that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that all blessings must proceed from him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE tragedy of the garden of Eden has never known a parallel. In fact, all other crimes and tragedies may be traced to the one there committed. Its enormity is enhanced by reason of the intelligence and greatness of the perpetrator of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">crime </span><span class="font5">and of his confidential relationship to the Eternal Creator. That terrible crime blighted the hopes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of men </span><span class="font5">and angels, filled the earth with woe and caused the very heavens to weep. It started the wheels </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of evil </span><span class="font5">and has caused them to roll on down through </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">corridors of the ages, spreading war, murder, disease, pestilence and famine, thus crushing out the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lifeblood </span><span class="font5">of countless millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So powerful, deceptive and cunning has been that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">arch </span><span class="font5">criminal that the sensibilities of mankind have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font5">stunned and benumbed, and the people for cen</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">turies </span><span class="font5">have been kept in ignorance of the cause and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font5">far-reaching effects.

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>OF LUCIFER</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God was man’s benefactor and friend. He had created Adam, given him a wife, provided him with a beautiful home, made him the prince of all he surveyed, clothed him with power to fill the earthly planet with a perfect race of people, to subdue the earth, and rule it. Naturally Adam would love God. In addition to that he was so created that he would instinctively worship the One who was his friend and benefactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The will of God is his law. When that will is expressed toward man it is the law of God by which man is to be governed. A refusal to obey God’s law makes the creature a disloyal subject. Without law there could be no way of testing man’s loyalty. There must be a rule of action commanding that which is right and prohibiting that which is wrong. God provided a law for man. It was in connection with the food of Adam that God expressed his will or commandment. No evil effects would, of course, result merely from the food, because all the food was perfect; but the evil result would be from the fact of disobedience of God’s law. The loss of life to man meant the loss of everything. God could not permit an unlawful creature to possess eternal life. He provided man’s food and in connection therewith said, by way of command to the man, this: “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”—Gen. 2:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in keeping with God’s loving provision for man to appoint an overseer or helper or protector who would aid man in avoiding the doing of that which was wrong and which would bring upon him the penalty for the violation of God’s law. It was the bright shining one, Lucifer, whom God selected from among the heavenly creatures and placed in Eden as overlord or protector of man. Concerning him and his appointment to this responsible office God said, as it is written in the prophecy of Ezekiel (28:14): “Thou art the anointed cherub that cover-eth; and I have set thee so.” The term “anointed” means that Lucifer, the cherub, was clothed with power and authority in the name of God to do certain things and in this instance he was clothed with power and authority as overlord in the “garden of God” to look after the interests of man and to keep him in the right way. Cherub means an officer or deputy to whom is delegated certain heavenly powers and duties. The word “covereth”, as used in Ezekiel's prophecy, means to screen, to shield, to protect. It follows, therefore, that Lucifer was clothed with power and authority to act as an overseer for man; to screen, to shield and protect him from taking a wrongful course by violating God’s law. It was his solemn duty, both to man and to God, to direct and influence humanity to go in the right way, that man might thereby honor God and prolong his life on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God had also clothed Lucifer with the power of death, according to the statement of the Apostle Paul in the second chapter of his letter to the Hebrews, verse fourteen. It was therefore a part of the official duty of Lucifer to put to death the man if he did violate God’s law. For this reason Lucifer occupied a confidential or fiduciary relationship toward God and man. There was committed into his hands a sacred trust of keeping God’s newly begun government on earth in a pure and proper condition. To betray that trust in order that he might overturn God’s appointed means of government in. Eden would </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">an act of treason. The perpetration of the crime of treason under such conditions would cover the perpetrator with perfidy and make him a nefarious, despicable creature and the blackest of all criminals. Clothed with the most honorable position in the universe aside from that of God’s only begotten Son, the Logos, a position even different from that of the Logos because of being placed as overlord and protector of a domain, Lucifer’s betrayal of that trust is so terrible that it could not- be properly stated in human phrase. The beauty, the purity and innocence of the perfect man and perfect woman, in the environment far more beautiful than any human eye has ever seen since, makes more pronounced the depravity of the heart that could commit the terrible crime hereinafter described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being one of the “morning stars” who witnessed the creation of man and his perfect home, and being appointed to the position of trust and confidence as man’s overlord, Lucifer, of course, knew that God had empowered man to produce his own species and that in due time the earth would be filled with a perfect race of people. He knew that man was so created that he must worship his benefactor. He knew that he must destroy in the mind of man the thought that God is his benefactor. Lucifer became ambitious to control the human race and to receive the worship to which God was justly entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer was impressed with his own beauty and importance and power and forgot that he owed an obligation to his Creator. Selfishness entered his heart. His motive was wrong and his heart became malignant. He was moved to take action concerning Adam, and his motive was wicked. Concerning this evil purpose the Prophet Isaiah (14:13,14) records of Lucifer in these words: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. ’ ’ The Scriptures clearly show that Lucifer’s process of reasoning was like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘I am overlord of man in Eden. I have the power to put man to death, but even though man violates God’s law I will not exercise that power. I will induce man to believe that God is not his friend and benefactor but in truth and in fact is deceiving man. Besides this, God will not be able to put man to death and at the same time maintain his own consistency; because he has declared that that tree in the midst of Eden is the tree of life, and to eat of that tree means that one will live forever. I will therefore take man to that tree and direct him to eat, and then he will not die but will live forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘But before I do that I will first induce Adam to believe that God is keeping him in ignorance and withholding from him the things that he is justly entitled to receive. Adam loves his wife. I will first induce Eve to do my bidding, and then through her I shall be able to control Adam. I will so throw the circumstances around Adam that he too will be induced to eat of the forbidden tree of knowledge, and then I will refuse to put either of them to death. Then I will immediately take them to the tree of life and have them eat of that fruit. Then they will live forever, and not die. By this means I will win them over to me and I will keep them alive forever. I will defy God; and while he has a realm of angels and other creatures of heaven that worship him, I shall be like the Host High and shall be worshiped even as God is worshiped. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures show that thus did Lucifer plan a rebellion. It was a cunning scheme that Lucifer thus devised; he thought it was a wise scheme. Evidently God knew about it from its inception, but he did not interfere until Lucifer had gone to the point of committing the overt act by overreaching man and inducing him to sin. Concerning this God said through his prophet Ezekiel these words: “Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.” (Ezek. 28:17) This selfish meditation in the heart of Lucifer was the beginning of iniquity in him. Up to that time he had been perfect, for Jehovah God had made him so. Of him God speaks through the Prophet Ezekiel and says: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” (Ezek. 28:15) The imperfection of Lucifer dates from that moment. That was the beginning of rebellion. That selfish meditation in Lucifer’s heart led to the terrible crime of treason and all the baneful effects that have followed since. ... It made a devil or opposer of God out of Lucifer. Concerning the terrible result of this to Lucifer it is further written in the prophecy (Ezek. 28:16-19) as follows: “Thou hast sinned: therefore I [the Lord Jehovah] will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will east thee to the ground. I will lay thee before kings, on they may behold there. ... I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.' ’ Thus the infallible prophetic Word of God declares the end of Lucifer, now Satan the Devil, to be utter destruction or annihilation. In his due time Jehovah God will execute his decree of destruction, and never shall Satan the Devil be any more!</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SOURCE OF T</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">P</span><span class="font5">ROFESSED Christians, who are such in name only and who in fact are hypocrites, have no vision or understanding of the divine purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font5">give honor to the Lord with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from him. By their false teachings they cause men to fear in a morbid manner what shall occur and therefore to rush into their organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people, however, are starving for want of true </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">food. </span><span class="font5">Therefore says the Lord, ‘ ‘ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people.” The wisdom of these wise men shall perish and their understanding shall be hid. Jehovah therefore is, through his beloved Son Christ Jesus, beginning a wonderful work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">is spreading among the people a knowledge of his goodness and his gracious provision for men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One means of carrying on this wonderful work is this, that the Lord God has brought the radio into operation. Foolish men, wise in their own conceit, do </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">hesitate to say that the radio is the result of the sagacity and ingenuity of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their statement is not true. More than thirty cen</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">turies </span><span class="font5">ago God foretold the time would come when he would send forth the message as the lightning and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">nothing would obstruct it. Those on the earth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">whom </span><span class="font5">God is making his witnesses to do his wonderful work are not among the earthly wise, rich or great, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">they are meek and teachable and appreciate the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font5">privilege of doing something in the name of Je</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The spreading of the truth is not the result of</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>RUE WISDOM</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">man’s efforts, but the Lord God himself is doing it through his constituted agencies. He is thereby serving notice upon the people in advance of his purpose to establish his great kingdom and completely destroy the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the day which the Lord has made and his people are now rejoicing that the truth is being made known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since it is the privilege and duty of these to make known the truth, then they would be displeasing to the Lord, violating his Word and thereby committing great wrong to indulge in a comparison of rhe truth with a detailed statement of the theories of evolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But some may say, Do not Christians with propriety discuss the questions of inherent immortality and eternal torment, and are not these devilish doctrines? Would it not be just as unreasonable to discuss them as it is the theory of evolution ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer is, No; for the reason that the men who advocate these doctrines claim that they are supported by the Bible and therefore concede the Bible as authority. To enter into a discussion of these questions is to determine whether or not the Bible does support them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Christian tries to prove that the Bible does not support these devilish doctrines. But the modernists who advocate evolution as the theory of the origin of man deny the Bible as authority and base their conclusion upon the wisdom of man. Therefore the very statement of their proposition is an insult to Jehovah and it becomes the duty of the Christian to refuse to consider the man-made evidence offered by so-called ‘scientists’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The truth is the means to bring men into harmony with the great Creator, Jehovah God. It was the beloved Son of God who spoke with authority concerning God’s Word, saying: “Thy word is truth.”— John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Word of God written by holy men of old was written under the direction of Jehovah and is good for the instruction of men who want to be led in the right way. (2 Pet. 1:21; 2 Tim. 3:16; Job 32:8) Only foolish men ignore the Bible in searching for a philosophy of the origin of man. It is wholly unreasonable to expect to find a satisfactory answer to the question, What is man? unless man goes outside of his own environment and seeks to know from the Word of the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Prophet David was much wiser than the savants of modern times. He was wise because he devoted himself to know and to do the will of God. He was a man after God’s own heart because he was always faithful to God. He made some grave mistakes because of his inherited weakness, but his heart was always true to the Lord, as the needle, when disturbed, again returns to the pole. The spirit of the Lord God moved upon his mind and he spoke the truth accordingly. (2 Sam. 23:2) That wise servant of God under inspiration wrote: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever. ’ ’—Ps. Ill: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wise men seek knowledge of the Word of God and then faithfully strive to conform themselves to that Word. The man who pursues such a course receives </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">favor of God. The proud and self-conceited God pushes away from him. (1 Pet. 5:5) The fool is estopped from his wicked comparison. By his lips he may claim to be the representative of God and at the same time by the doctrines he advocates he denies the very existence of Jehovah. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning this God’s prophet wrote: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. ” (Ps. 14:1) The heart is here used as a symbol of man’s motive directing his course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">modernist or evolutionist with assumed selfwisdom says in substance: ‘ I am a doctor of divinity. Mark my wisdom. I know that man is a result of the evolution process and that he continues to evolve upward.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is really the motive of such a man? It is to attract attention to his own wisdom. He is extremely selfish and by his haughtiness and arrogance he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘There is no Creator of heaven and earth or of man. The things that we see came by blind force and man is a creature of evolution.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fool is proud of himself and revels in his own ‘greatness’ and delights to hear his praises sung by others. These so-ealled “wise” savants or modernists find pleasure in bestowing flattery upon each other. They stick out their chest and talk with great gravity and address each other as “Doctor”, or with some other title, and frequently speak of each other’s greatness and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus the enemy Satan uses them to blind each other and to bring reproach upon the name of the great and loving God. They have created for themselves a reputation among men for their wisdom and greatness; and by their influence they turn the minds of the people away from God, the true Benefactor and Friend of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is marvelous how our God foreknew and foretold in his Word these things. Now the true student of prophecy can read the words of Jehovah written long ago and understand the course taken by these modern self-conceited savants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the church denominations are some dear souls who are sad at heart because of the arrogance and self-conceit of the clergy. These cry unto the Lord, asking the Lord for relief. Thus the prophet of God represents them as praying: “Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips, and with a double heart, do they speak.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To their cry the response is: “The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things. ’ ’ The arrogance of these self-coneeited wise men who call themselves “doctors of divinity” was foretold by the prophet thus: “Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?”—Ps. 12:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this hour of great hypocrisy in the ecclesiastical systems those who turn to the Word of God find encouragement. Those who cry to the Lord, as the prophet here represents, hear the response from God’s Word thus: “For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him. The words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, 0 Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. ’ ’— Ps. 12:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most arrogant of all men are the clergymen of the present time. Hypocritically they call themselves by the name of the Lord; they ignore his Word and mislead the people by giving utterance to their own so-called ‘wisdom’. These are the ones who deny the Word of God and teach the doctrine of the evolution of man, contrary to his Word. They are a part of this world, or the Devil’s organization, because they are allied with the rulers who rule over the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font5">declares that their haughtiness and arrogance shall not long endure. “And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.” (Isa. 13:11) ‘‘Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.”—Prov. 16:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The origin of man is a secret revealed only by the Word of God. No man could know the truth thereof except from the revelation of God as given in his Word. It would be utterly impossible for a man or men thousands of years removed from the beginning of the race to tell how it began unless some record is given by the great Creator. God, the great Creator, is pleased to make known his secret to those who love and serve him. The secret of the Lord is with them. —Ps. 25:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">David loved and served Jehovah God, and the spirit of the Lord God was upon him and he wrote: “O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.” (Ps. 8:1, 2) The words of David, in the second verse especially, are prophetic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord foreknew that the modernist wise savant or evolutionist clergy would arise and that these would be the instruments of the wicked one and therefore enemies. Consequently he caused David to write that out of the mouth of babes should come strength; thereby meaning that the strength of God’s Word would be proclaimed, not by the great and mighty and the self-constituted wise, but by those who possess the teachable, humble disposition of a babe. And even so we find that these are the ones who are declaring the message of God’s goodness to the people and therefore they are having a part in this wonderful work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the night watches David gazed into the heavenly canopy above and there beheld some of the marvels of God’s creation. How wonderful, grand and sublime they are! Every reverential mind delights to behold them at nightfall. Each planet in its assigned orbit moves noiselessly on and the very obedience thereof to God’s law proclaims the praises of the everlasting Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As David beheld these wonders of creation he was moved with adoration and praise. Then he turned his eyes upon himself or men about him and said: ‘‘When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him ? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands: thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, ... 0 Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! ’ ’—Ps. 8: 3-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How different the words of the inspired prophet from those of the modern clergymen! It is manifest that the latter are the instruments of Satan, whether or not they know it, because in their arrogance they blaspheme the name of God, turning the people away from him, and serve Satan’s purpose. As a public rebuke to the evolutionists the prophet of God wrote: ‘‘Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that made us, and not we ourselves: we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. ’ ’—Ps. 100: 3.</span></p>

In addition to this we have the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> books, which truly contain, a ‘feast of fat things’ for Jehovah’s anointed people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest army of Jehovah’s witnesses ever assembled in the Southern Hemisphere is gathered together at this convention, and one and all wish to convey to you their whole-hearted appreciation of the faithful efforts of the brethren at the head office and at the factory, who produce and send out the millions of books and booklets, which enable us to place the message of life in the hands of the people in such a clear, concise and effective way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also desire to inform you how greatly the Lord has blessed the radio work in this country, per medium of the electrical transcriptions. Twenty stations are putting these over regularly each week, and although we cannot see you in the flesh, we delight to hear your voice over the air, sending forth the glorious message of the kingdom in such a straightforward and convincing way. During the convention a local station has broadcast one of your lectures every evening at seven o’clock, together with an appropriate announcement concerning the work of the Society and of the convention meetings now in session. A radio set has been installed in the hall, enabling the assembled brethren and the public to have the pleasure of hearing these lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was not until after the date of the convention had been fixed that it was seen that it coincided exactly with the International Thanksgiving Testimony Period, and a great effort has been made to reach the people with the message. Every morning, from 8 a.m. to 12 noon, has been set aside for that purpose. For the first time in the history of the work in Australia, an organized effort has been made to reach the people on the streets in the city. The success which has attended this work has manifested the rich blessing of the Lord upon it. The police on duty showed great sympathy with the message, many of them taking the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet. Three such efforts resulted in an average of 224 workers in the field on each occasion, the total pieces of literature placed being 4,682. The joy of the Lord which fills our hearts as we return from these outings can surely be experienced only by those who are the true witnesses of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Report of Convention Field Service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Average number of workers each outing . . 247</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Largest number in field at one time , . . 375</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Total testimonies........ 55,680</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Grand total books and booklets . . . 13,159</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many comments have been heard upon the letter appearing in a recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> regarding the election of elders, and the need for a clearer recognition of the fact that Jehovah’s organization functions from the throne down, and not from the ranks up. While it is premature to express ourselves definitely upon this matter, we wish to state that whatever instructions come to us through the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will be gladly acted upon, because we know they will be Scripturally sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, dear brother, we register our inflexible determination to remain absolutely loyal and faithful to Jehovah’s organization, and to unhesitatingly cooperate with you in every feature of the Lord’s work as it is revealed to us. “To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams ’ ’; and to prove our fidelity and devotion to the Giver of all good, the language of our hearts, by His grace, will ever be, ‘Here am I, Lord; send me.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With warmest Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brethren in kingdom service, </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Australasian Convention</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">‘JEHOVAH’S NAME BE EXTOLLED!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mv </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dearly beloved Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I feel compelled to write you a few lines of appreciation on account of our privileges in connection with the spreading of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom.</span><span class="font4"> It has presented us grand and very encouraging opportunities to give a powerful witness for our great Jehovah, and it has opened us doors through which it generally has been very difficult to come. So I have had an opportunity to visit many leaders in high position, giving to many of them a good testimony about the truth. Among them was also the piesident of Finland. I was granted an audience with him and got a kind reception. After presenting the matter before him, he said that it is something which the people need in this time of distress, and he also expressed his gratitude over the visit and the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection it has been also very encouraging to see some fulfilments of Revelation 3: 9. One of our brethren at the office visited one D.D. He was so angry that he pushed out our brother and also east out the book he left. The following day he came to our office desiring to see the brother, asking him to forgive, and accepting the book. I visited a denominational pastor. He not only accepted the book, but he desired to talk with me. As a result of it he came the following day to me for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy.</span><span class="font4"> When I offered him the whole set, he said: ‘I will not take all the books, because in this way I get other opportunities to come to you for more books.’ IVith very keen interest he listened to my answers to his questions. He admitted that our books are the only ones, among all ‘religious’ books, that give food; others have nothing. Certainly we can exclaim with the psalmist: Our “possessions are fallen in agreeable places’’. May the Lord’s name be extolled!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hoping that the dear Lord may continually richly bless you and direct you in your faithful endeavors to magnify His holy name, I send my best and warmest greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your grateful and happy brother by His marvelous grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kaarlo Harteva, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE, STUDY, JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The small company here recently signified their desire to accept the new name “Jehovah’s witnesses”. While each ot us had accepted the new name from the time it was made known to us individually, we thought it might be well to let you know as a company how we greatly appreciate the privilege of being witnesses for Jehovah, and giving honor to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W<sup>T</sup>e want you to know also how very much we appreciate the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font4"> articles; they are deep, yet a careful and prayerful study of them brings forth that rich spiritual food which only the consecrated can enjoy fully, and which is so strengthening as this time. Surely there is no controversy m that which is coming to the remnant at this time, which indicates the Lord Jehovah is using the same channel he has used in the past. It really seems as though service and study go hand in hand; and this brings the joy of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May the Lord continue to bless and guide you and all the dear colaborers at the Bible house, is our prayer.</span></p>
