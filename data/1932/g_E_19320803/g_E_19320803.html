<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Getting Rid of the Nuisances</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IN  </span><span class="font4">ARMAGEDDON we hope to get rid of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">biggest</span><span class="font4"> Nuisance in all creation and at the same time get rid of his comrades, visible and invisible, that have done so much to defile the universe. But even if we could wake up tomorrow in a world in which “that old Serpent’’ Satan and his evil angels would no longer exercise a potent influence and in which there would be neither fraudulent nor oppressive big business, nor dishonest and unfaithful politicians, nor lying and hypocritical clergy, we would still have plenty of nuisances left, and this article has to do with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When is a thing a nuisance? The obvious answer is that it does not become a nuisance until it trespasses upon the rights of others. Smoke is not a nuisance of itself, but it may become so. Noise is not a nuisance of itself. Riveting or pile-driving machines are all right in their time and place, but it would be an annoyance to have one in full operation in or near one's bedroom in the wee small hours of the night. Blasting is not of itself a nuisance. It is all right if done in a quarry, but if done next door to your dwelling it must be carefully done or it becomes a nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fertilizer factory or chemical factory is all right in its place, yet it would be an intolerable nuisance in a residential neighborhood. And so we might go on down the list. There is a right and a wrong place for garbage, sewage, tin cans and old automobiles, as well as for the earthly representatives of the Devil, whose proper* place, all must admit, is the cemetery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every person who owns a piece of land has a right to the enjoyment of that land, without its soil's being unduly contaminated by sewage or chemicals, cans, automobiles or rubbish of any kind from adjoining properties. Moreover, he is entitled to the full enjoyment of the air above that land, and his neighbor may not fill that air with an unjust amount of smoke, soot, vapors or gases, obnoxious to the eye or the sense of smell, nor may it be filled by his neighbor with unpleasant or offensive sounds, especially in the hours usually devoted to slumber ; and what his neighbor may not do to him, he, in turn, must refrain from doing to his neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the world gets more and more filled with people it becomes necessary that better and better arrangements should be made for conducting building, manufacturing and transportation operations with a minimum of noise or odors. It is encouraging that better and better methods are being put into operation for the disposal of the wastes inseparable from human life and activity, as garbage, sewage, ashes and litter of all sorts.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Disposal of Garbage</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">A generation ago, in all except the larger cities, the family garbage was fed to the family pig and eventually found its way back into the soil of the family garden as fertilizer. Even the bones of the pig were burned, and the ashes strewn upon the soil helped to maintain the fertility of the garden plot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even today a small portion of the garbage of New York city, particularly the refuse of restaurants, clubs and hotels, goes into the manufacture of pork. In Los Angeles county, California, in 1929, forty-four of the municipalities in the county disposed of their garbage in this manner, in some instances receiving revenue from it of fifty cents per ton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some places garbage is used directly as a fertilizer, without first feeding it to the pigs. When this is done, the best results are obtained if it is first pulverized. Several of the largest centers of population in the United States dispose of their garbage by the reduction method, but the value of the grease and oils recovered is not large and the method is no longer popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The larger cities in the country are committed to incineration. In Holland for centuries all the garbage has been towed out to sea and thrown away. New York city was originally settled by the Dutch, and it was perfectly natural for this system, or lack of system, to be transferred to these shores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And that is exactly what has happened. The garbage of New York city has been transferred to the shores of New Jersey and Long Island with a vengeance. Take, for instance, Bath Beach; it is an excellent beach, but you are in luck if when you come up out of the water you do not have an old cabbage leaf for a headdress or a part of a carrot in your ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Supreme Court of the United States has promised New Jersey that no more of New York city’s garbage will be strewn on their beaches after June 1,1933. As a consequence New York is building a number of huge garbage incinerators, to supplement those already in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inspection of garbage is forbidden in some cities on account of the degrading, repulsive and unhealthful employment. Yet in some cities this is carried to great lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Florence, Italy, the city has 204 concrete chambers or cells in which garbage is stored for six weeks until fermentation occurs and a fairly dry and useful fertilizer is secured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another way of disposal of garbage, and a good one, is to spread it six feet thick on flat ground and cover it immediately with six inches of fresh, clean earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New York city now has a number of covered garbage vans that are good to look at and are not offensive to the nostrils. They are finished in white enamel and are a credit to the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Rotterdam the garbage is burned, and provides enough power to run the entire trolley system of the city. The entrance to the principal garbage destruction plant at Frankfort on the Main is decorated with an oil painting. At Fuerth the incinerator is surrounded by a beautiful garden.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Removal of Ashes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">New York has a tremendous waste problem. It is estimated that last year’s bulk of ashes, garbage, boxes, papers and similar material totaled more than 20,000,000 cubic yards. The removal of several million cubic yards of ashes every year from all parts of a great city and in all kinds of weather is not exactly a nice job. The actual work of removal is considerable, but the noise and dust features make this one of the city’s difficult jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the ashes arc still dumped in open trucks with a clatter calculated to &quot;wake the dead’, but with so much dust that if one were to awaken in the midst of it he would almost want to go back to where he came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two dustless methods have been adopted, but no noiseless method exists. In one of the dustless methods the full cans and their contents are carried away and empty cans are left in their place. In the other method (almost dustless) the mouths of the cans are all of one size and are made to fit an opening in the truck into which they are dumped. Dustless vehicles of this description are now used in 136 cities.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Noise Abatement Commission</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Studying cases of excessive noise in New York city it is estimated that 44 percent of the city’s schools are injured by noise that is retarding the development of 470,400 children. Conditions about the hospitals are still worse, as it is estimated that 80 percent of them are surrounded by noise conditions that interfere with the recovery of patients. Orders have recently been issued that no collections of ashes or garbage are to be made near schools during school hours or near hospitals except between the hours of 10 a. m. and 4 p. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A woman in Bridgeport, disturbed at four o’clock in the morning by the collection of ashes in her backyard, happened to know the contractor who has the ash collection contract and secured an abatement of the nuisance by getting the contractor out of bed at four o’clock in the morning by the persistent ringing of his telephone. When he came to the telephone she said, &quot;‘Good morning. I have just been awakened by one of your workmen removing ashes from my backyard. So I thought I’d call you up and see how well you enjoy having your sleep disturbed at this hour of the morning.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Keeping Streets Clean</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">It takes an army of 10,207 officers and men to operate the street-cleaning department of New York city. This number is about equally divided between sweepers and drivers. The per capita cost is greater than that for any other large city in the world, yet the condition of New York streets is not a matter in which New Yorkers take any pride. The pieces of newspaper which</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>GOLDEN AGE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">are blowing about in every direction give New York the appearance of being dirtier than it really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Obviously one of the best ways of keeping 3,300 miles of streets reasonably clean is to keep the waste paper out of them, and therefore it was a step in the right direction to purchase 50,000 waste paper cans to be placed at 25,000 street intersections, two at each intersection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Waste baskets should be of moderate size and be fastened to posts or walls, as otherwise they get knocked over; and they need to be emptied frequently, as otherwise their purpose is defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the spotless towns of Germany the litter baskets bear signs reading: “The cleanness of the city is in your hands.” Signs on British baskets read, “Litter, please.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Manchester an educational campaign was waged against the littering of the streets. Public utility bills and library cards bore labels urging the people not to litter the streets. Many other forms of publicity were used, and all with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Munich and Nuremberg and other German cities a person who drops anything in the streets is fined one mark and receives a receipt on the spot. The results are excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In London notices are posted in the buses asking that tickets given in exchange for the penny or two-penny fare be thrown on the floor of the bus before the passenger alights, thus sparing the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Coney Island (New York) in the summer season more than 7,000 milk bottles are recovered daily from the beach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sweeping and Washing Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the cleanest cities of Europe householders have the sidewalks in front of their houses cleaned, as well as the streets. By this method all the sidewalks are kept clean and the litter of dirty sidewalks is never swept into clean streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a social sin to keep dogs in the city or to throw newspapers, fruit skins or other refuse into the street, into vacant lots or anywhere else than in a receptacle provided for the purpose; to spit in any place where other people must walk, or to mix garbage and papers, ashes or tin cans in the same receptacle. Outdoor cleanliness begins indoors. It is impossible for any city to be very clean where there are as many cigarette smokers as in New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New York still depends largely on hand workers for keeping its streets clean, and this includes snow removal. But there are pick-up machines which do the work of sprinkling and sweeping and carrying away the fine dirt of the pavements. These do the work of a dozen men. Mechanical cleaners are not so well suited to the cleaning of cobblestone pavements, where the litter settles down between the paving stones. They are best used at night, when the streets are relatively free from motor cars, either traveling or at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Water is the finishing process in the cleaning of streets, but the washing machine should not be used where the pavement is very dirty or there are many large particles present. A modern street-washing machine will thoroughly drench a street sixty feet wide or can be operated in such a way as to sprinkle a narrow path along the gutter. There are combinations of washers and driers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the University of Berlin and the University of London courses of instruction in municipal cleansing are provided which embrace instruction on a long list of subjects of interest to municipal engineers and municipal employees.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>The Operation of Incinerators</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">American incinerators are built merely with the object of reducing waste to ashes with the least possible delay. They do not try to save any of the heat units the waste material may contain. In Europe disposition of this waste matter has been more carefully studied. Some of their plants produce enough electric current to operate all the refuse-collecting trucks which the city needs, supply all the power required to carry on the mechanical processes used at the plant to light the works and to pump the city’s water or sewage. In one instance the surplus heat is used to supply public buildings and dwelling houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Manchester, England, magnetic separators extract all metal pieces and pass the rest of the material on to a rotary screen. Tin cans are baled, and bottles and broken glass are also salvaged and sold in bulk. In many places the cinders resulting from incineration are used for road-making material. In some other places the cinders are turned into bricks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An item from Providence, R. I., says that every year 50,000 Christmas trees are burned in the municipal incinerator. Surely the heat these burning trees would generate could be used to accomplish some useful purpose.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>The Smoke Nuisance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">We inhale 37½ pounds of air a day. This is more than five times the weight of the food and water we consume, and it makes a lot of difference what is contained in the air we take into our lungs. Not only does smoke in the air injure our lungs, but it sometimes shuts out as much as 46 percent of the available sunlight, including the ultra-violet rays so essential to good health. Sometimes there is a quantity of sulphur fumes in the air sufficient to be a real menace to plant and animal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In London in the eighteenth century the smoke was so thick that those musicians who came into the city from the country lost three whole notes in the ranges of their voices. Sudden drafts down the chimneys drove the smoke through the rooms and deposited the soot on everything. Today London has two smoke spotters, men whose business it is to watch factory chimneys and signal the operating firms when the smoke pouring from the chimneys becomes more dense than the law permits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Pittsburgh industrial plants a beam of light is kept constantly in the chimney and pointed at a photo-electric cell which is so sensitive that it provides the engine room with an exact record of the density of the smoke at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the careful use of auxiliary gas jets which accomplish the complete combustion of coal dust, Pittsburgh, once the smokiest city in the world, is now less so than some of the English cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is estimated that in the year 1911 in the city of London 650 tons of dirt fell to the square mile. Liverpool is almost as bad, with 560 tons to the square mile. In the last twenty years the smoke evil in London has been lessened, until now it is about half of what it was twenty years ago. In New York city the evil has been reduced fifty percent within the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In England smoke is now estimated to do an annual damage of $250,000,000. In America the cost is estimated at $20 per family per year, or about $600,000,000 for the country as a whole. The cost is largely due to the decreased earning power of the family, owing to the sunlight's being shut out, but it is partly caused also by the increased cost of cleaning and laundering carpets, hangings and all kinds of fabrics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Brooklyn, in a few hours, desks and tables become so covered with soot and dust that they require to be wiped off at least twice a day. Of the large cities of the United States, Boston is the cleanest; and then in order come San Francisco, New Orleans, Denver, Washington, Des Moines, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and Columbus, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toledo is almost exactly twice as dirty as Boston, and Milwaukee and Baltimore are still worse. It is estimated that more than a ton of soot per square mile per day falls in the central part of Rochester, that smoke deprives Philadelphia of thirty percent of its sunshine, and that it shortens or destroys the life of trees and shrubs in St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not only is smoke a hazard to life by cutting off the sun’s life-giving rays and by filling the air we breathe with gas and dirt, but its soot also contains oil and tarry substances, sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid sufficient to cause marbles, cements and stones to break down. Mortar subjected to soot-carrying smokes becomes brittle and useless as a binding medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An editorial writer in a British medical journal estimates that three million tons of soot are discharged into the air yearly in Britain alone, an amount equal in weight to three days’ output from all their mines. The constant breathing of sooty air causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and systemic poisoning. If this soot were not removed it would in time bury our cities. The life of paint and wall coverings is shortened by soot. The pine, fir and spruce refuse to grow where soot is deposited upon their foliage and where there are gases in the air. However, there is a Japanese tree, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ginkgo,</span><span class="font4"> which thrives in poisoned air, and can be planted in place of the nobler American trees forced out by our dirty methods of air pollution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is predicted that the city of the future will be heated, lighted and operated without any coal’s being consumed within its limits, and perhaps not within a hundred miles. The use of electricity in the service of man has only begun, and the proper use of fuel hardly that.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Disposal of Sewage</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Disposal of the sewage of a city of seven million people is a real problem. At present all the waste from the bodies of these swarming millions goes into New York bay, into the North (or Hudson) river, which is a real river, and into the East river, which has practically no current but is in fact a lagoon open at both ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some places in New York harbor the waterbed is covered with sewage sludge ten feet or more in thickness. Every space between the piers on the East and North rivers is a sewage trap. Some of the waters around New York already have more waste than they can neutralize, and New York knows that it must now undertake a modern system of sewage disposal. It is estimated that a sewage disposal plant that would make New York harbor as clean as it was forty years ago would cost $378,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is probably no reason why the sewage of New York cannot be handled as in the suburbs of Nassau, N. P., Bahamas. There yeast produces fermentation in the sewage, the fermentation draws flies, the flies breed maggots, the maggots eat the sewage and wind up by eating one another. It is claimed that the results are perfectly pure water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dr. John Arthur Wilson, of Milwaukee, has proposed the same system of converting the sewage of our great cities into pure water and fertilizer worth twenty dollars a ton. As Doctor Wilson says, “when introduced in the sewage under proper conditions the protozoa eat all the bacteria, and, with their food supply gone, the protozoa die and their bodies settle, leaving water which is purer than the drinking water in many cities. The dead protozoa may be made into a fertilizer rich in nitrogen and phosphoric acid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New York knows what to do to settle its sewage problem, but, of course, it is held back from doing what it knows to do, and what it ought to do, by the consideration of cost. It needs, perforce, to use its millions for million-dollar blocks of pure graft, such as are exposed continually by the Seabury investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Tri-State Anti-Pollution Commission, representing New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, has agreed “that the waters of these shores shall be freed of all free solids; if such waters are used for bathing they shall have an oxygen content of at least fifty percent, and if they are used for commercial purposes the oxygen is never to fall below thirty percent”. It is believed that if this agreement is carried out fish will return to the Hudson and East rivers. As it is now, the rivers are so dirty that the fish are ashamed to be seen in them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Ship Pollution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Aside from other causes of pollution above mentioned is the fact that some two million gallons of oil per day are poured into the ocean by the ever-increasing number of ships that use fuel oil. There are coves in Wales and Cornwall, and there are even places on the shores of New Jersey, where one cannot go for a swim without coming out more dirty than when going in. Thousands of seabirds have died after getting their feathers covered with oil; not able thereafter to fly, and getting quickly wet through to the skin, they soon die of pneumonia. Occasionally kind-hearted bird-lovers bathe these pitiful captives in gasoline and give them a fresh lease of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Off New York harbor there are eight patrol boats which watch for pollution of water by ships. In a recent five-month period $57,000 in fines were levied in one federal district alone for violation by ships of the pollution statutes. Vessels are not supposed to dump oil or refuse in the harbor waters, but must carry garbage, ashes and other waste at least twenty-five miles to sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Muffling the Noises</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not possible to operate a great city without producing some noise, but when attention was given to the subject it was surprising how much was accomplished in New York city in noise abatement. Now if you toot an automobile horn unnecessarily it is likely to cost you a dollar. If your brakes are noisy, another dollar; if the cut-out is unmuffled, two dollars. Motor cycles receive the same attention, as do also trucks and buses. The clattering of garbage cans and ash cans costs two dollars; rattling of milkbottles and unnecessary noise in ice-delivery, two dollars; loud-speakers operated to the annoyance of neighbors, one dollar; noisy parties after midnight, two dollars; noisy pets, fifty cents; doormen’s whistles, one dollar. For operating a loud-speaker in front of a store a magistrate recently fined a radio dealer thirty dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man in Berlin, in an effort to get square with a noisy neighbor in the apartment above him, tried to see how much noise he could make by means of a violiji string stretched immediately beneath the ceiling and belabored with a bow several hours daily, while standing on a stepladder. He was fined two hundred marks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whir of airplane motors at night has proven an annoyance to residents in the vicinity of airports, and a means must be found to muffle the noise or night flying will have to be reduced materially. A campaign of advertising by broadcasting from a plane with a loud-speaker over an area of several square miles seems to have been abandoned. Perhaps the Noise Abatement Commission compelled a cessation of that nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is work yet to be done by the Noise Abatement Commission in regard to the noise of automobile horns. Evidently this whole subject of automobile noises should be considered from every angle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A noise which can be entirely obviated is the one resulting from vehicles passing over manhole covers. The clack-clack that results can be overcome by placing a rubber washer in the ring in which the cover rests, and by having it rest upon a rubber gasket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Motor boats and motor cycles have been a nuisance to many because of the noise they emit. We do not know whether the law passed, but in France there was recently a demand made for a law prohibiting the sale of toy trumpets and tin whistles. It seems that such a law would be a reasonable one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When it comes to noise, the whole question resolves itself into the Golden Rule, ‘Whatsoever ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.’ No one objects to reasonable and necessary noises incident to our machine civilization, but we can all look forward hopefully to a time when there will be an incomparably greater amount of work done in the earth than is now done, but without commotion and almost without noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the great buildings in New York city are now equipped with automatic mufflers which prevent outside noises of the city, even of the immediate neighborhood, from finding access into the offices. In the offices themselves noiseless typewriters have reduced to a minimum the nervous strain imposed upon the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hail, happy day, when all earth's nuisances will be under perfect control!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Los Angeles Getting Nervous</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">S</span><span class="font4">OMEBODY has sent us a nicely gotten up little book of 64 pages entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles County, California, Today.</span><span class="font4"> It is intended to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the county; it is published and copyrighted by the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We turn to the first page. It is the “Dedication”. It says a word or two about the sturdy pioneers of the county, and then it refers to their “descendants”. The Chamber of Commerce is unduly nervous. The Mooney case and the mild winter, along with the world-wide depression, have been too much for the learned men that prepare the literature for Eastern consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First, let us explain that when a thing is “descendent” it is going down. The word should be spelled with an “s”. Now it may well enough be that Los Angeles county is going down, for it is more or less in the earthquake zone; but the thing should not be advertised to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maybe the Chamber of Commerce meant only to convey the thought that the county is going down financially, and that is probably true, but we comfort them with the thought that the whole world shares in their present anxiety; and, again, it is not best to advertise your woes and your fears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, again, it may be that the word intended was “descendants”, a word with which most people are more familiar than they are with either “descendants” or “descendents”. It is best to be particular about little things like that, lest the booklet fall into the hands of somebody that is well posted on the Mooney frame-up and they fall into hilarity at the Chamber’s expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the package of literature is a badly mimeographed circular letter or “Warning” advising job hunters to stay away from California, and we cannot say that we think this is bad advice. The “Warning” contains information that unless one has the means to live for three years without help from anybody except his parents, and then only if he is a minor, the best thing he can do is to be content to stay away. If he has money enough to last three years he is welcome to come, but if anybody gets it away from him before the three years are up he will be out of luck, and that doesn’t mean “maybe”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">F</span><span class="font4">OTi a number of years the question of nationalizing radio in Canada lias been a matter of much discussion both in parliament and out. During that time the private interests have of course waged a relentless warfare against nationalizing culminating in a very active campaign of recent date. Despite this opposition, Parliament, on May 11, passed unanimously the report of the radio committee recommending nationalization, and now it is only a matter of determining in detail how the undertaking will be carried out. The recommendation of the committee is that a commission comprising three members be appointed, that a chairman be appointed for a period of ten years, a vice-chairman appointed for a nine-year period, and a third commissioner holding office for eight years. The headquarters will be Ottawa, with branches located wherever the commission deems advisable. Provision is made for the appointment of not more than nine assistant commissioners, and not more than one of these to be from one province, the intention being to have one assistant commissioner in each province, whose duties will be to organize provincial advisory boards to work with the commission.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Show of Force at St. John’s</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The determination of those in power to rule regardless of the wish of the people and regardless of the means used to do so is evidenced in a recent happening in Newfoundland concerning which we quote from an editorial appearing in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Phoenix</span><span class="font4"> of Saskatoon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The arrival at St. John's, capital of Newfoundland and scene of recent riots, of a war vessel of the British navy is rather amusing in view of the fact that after the first flare of political temper the city and country have been quiet. It sounds almost as though Premier Squires views the row as a revolution instead of a parade which became rough when lack of consideration rasped the tempers of its members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After disappearing from the scene for a few days Premier Squires returned to his office and announced that his government would not resign, but that he would stay in office regardless of public opinion until defeated on the floor of the house. There is little doubt about that defeat’s coming rapidly once parliament reassembles. In the meantime the government remains in office, and now has its authority supported by a warship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Naturally the citizens of St. John’s were somewhat startled at the display of naval force. It must make them feel that Newfoundland is classified with some of the republics of South America where politics usually means violence and elections take the form of revolutions. As a matter of fact the people of Newfoundland are politically keen. Their party contests are carried on with much turbulence, although never before had they attained anything like the violence of the recent disturbance. But to bring a warship to the capital is hardly justified any more than the Canadian government was justified in posting a small army on Parliament Hill to receive a deputation of unemployed.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Wholesale Deportation from Edmonton</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The dilemma in which the rulers find themselves in regard to the unemployment situation is somewhat reflected in an editorial appearing in the Saskatoon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font4"> which reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The city of Edmonton is embarking on a policy of wholesale deportation. Applications have been made for the removal to their homelands of some 300 or 400 of the unemployed in that city, and it is said that 50 percent or more of those now drawing relief are fit subjects for similar action. The policy is being adopted as a means of making the unemployment load lighter, and possibly it will achieve that aim, temporarily at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The adoption of this plan may be taken as an indication that the civic authorities do not entertain an optimistic outlook as to the year 1932. If they did they might reasonably consider their quota of unemployed would be absorbed in the normal course of improvement. Other cities of the west appear to be more hopeful, and their hope seems to be based on good grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is commonly said that Canada’s industrial and transportation structure is built on too large a scale for the population and that the structure must either be torn down to an appropriate size or population must be increased until it justifies the equipment. The necessity of increased population was pointed out at the last meeting of the Canadian chamber of commerce. Of course, this is no time to encourage immigration, but equally truthfully it may be said it is no time to decrease population providing there is any possibility of the surplus’ being absorbed in selfsustaining occupation. Surely it would not be more expensive to give those who have been unfortunate a helping hand to establish themselves on the land on a sustenance basis than to ship them and their families across the Atlantic.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Royal Bank Abandons Hope</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Under the caption, “The Royal Bank Joins the Bolsheviks,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Forward</span><span class="font4"> has the following to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">■When no less an institution than the Royal Bank of Canada circulates statements that the capitalist system is no longer intact and is fast falling into decay, the average reader is forced to “sit up and take notice”, though he might not be impressed by the same statement in the radical press. Exactly this has happened in a recent letter of the Royal Bank of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The soundness of the general framework of capitalist society, which could be taken for granted in the normal depression,” says the author, “has been affected not only in Europe and Latin America but elsewhere as well. It is mere affectation to pretend that the world structure of today is sound in all respects, or to expect that things will recover merely as a consequence of hoping that somehow or other the world will ‘muddle through’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“There are evidences of decay,” continues the letter, “but they are not yet so serious as to warrant the conclusion that nothing can be done. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Possible solutions, says the author, may be found along two lines. One is to reduce the rewards of labor in line with falling selling prices. (The farmer might decide that the experiment had been tried in his case.) This solution is a “doubtful one”, since it threatens “the further dissolution of the economic system through prolonged and disastrous wage conflicts ’ ’. Another plan, inflation to reduce the debt burden, seems equally dubious to the author, who fears there is not “enough will-power, imagination and determination” to carry it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Written by a European economist, the article takes a much closer view of conditions in the worst depressed capitalist countries than most articles circulated in Canada. The author makes no attempt to persuade his readers that cither of the two depression remedies he suggests can be made a practical success, rather points out that neither can be put into practice. One is left with the impression that the author feels that capitalism has about a 50-50 chance of coming through this crisis, in an impaired state which would seem to give it very little hope for the next crisis.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Cod Liver Oil by Freezing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">People of all time have been much interested in fishing and its development, and no doubt many will be found interested in a recent experiment in Nova Scotia as reported in the following news item appearing in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Telegram</span><span class="font4"> of Toronto:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While politicians discuss the relative advantage or disadvantages of trawlers in the fishing industry of the Atlantic province, and of the possibility of introducing new methods of fish smoking and refrigeration into one of the key industries of the Maritimes, a few scientists at the Fisheries Experimental Station here perform quietly and without publicity experiments of great value to this important industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much progress has been made by Dr. Leim and his associates in the preparation of cod liver oil by freezing, as contrasted to the older method of cooking. Experiments at the station showed that much of the oil could be removed from the livers by freezing alone. The procedure was to freeze the livers, leave them in cold storage for a few days, and then run them through a meat chopper. The resulting oil had less color than that produced by cooking, and an examination at the University of Toronto indicated that the vitamin content was unchanged from that of oil obtained in the usual fashion. It was also found that more oil could be obtained from freezing alone than could be skimmed from a cooking kettle. These results will enable the extraction of oil from livers in plants which have cold storage, but are not equipped for steam cooking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Results were also tabulated on the drying of fish in cold storage, and a method was developed whereby “freezing burn”, which at present time entails commercial losses, could be remedied by freezing under a new process. A “jacketed” room, associated with automatic temperature control, presents a method of preventing “freezing burn” without either glazing or packaging the fish or other commodities in storage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Halifax, the drying in such a room was compared with that in an ordinary room with visible coils. It was found that thin plates of iee lost weight five times as rapidly in the ordinary room as they did in the jacketed room, for the same time of exposure. There was only a slight loss of weight in the jacketed room, which indicated that the application of the principles had been almost perfect.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>The Millar Estate Again</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">A Toronto lawyer with a certain sense of humor and who righteously despised self-righteous hypocrites died in 1926 and left an estate of over half a million. In his will he bequeathed to various preachers, strong advocates of prohibition, a share apiece in a brewery, and to one whom he apparently considered a hypocrite in his attitude towards horse racing, stock in the jockey club provided he registered as a member within a certain specified time. The balance of his estate he willed to the Ontario mother giving birth to the largest number of children in the ten years following his death. The irony and sarcasm of his will nettled some of the self-righteous politicians and a bill was presented in parliament with a view to making void the will and confiscating the property. The following Canadian Press report will no doubt be found interesting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Ontario government may have a legal fight on its hands with the mother of more than a score of children, after the expiry of the ten-year period, in 1936, fixed by the late Charles Millar in his unique will when he bequeathed the residue of his half-million-dollar estate to the Ontario mother having the greatest number of babies in the ten years following his death. He died October 31, 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The government has introduced a bill in the legislature to set aside the will and appropriate the estate for the benefit of the University of Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The measure was given second reading in the legislature today. A. W. E. N. Sinclair, K.C., Liberal leader, declared the province had no indication that the will was not perfectly valid or that Mr. Millar had any intention of leaving his money to the university.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Toronto there are at least two women who are in the running for the estate under the provisions of the will, and others have been reported from time to time in various parts of the province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mrs. Henry Brown, of Toronto, who is the mother of 13 living children, six of them born since the death of Mr. Millar, and Mrs. Grace Bagnato, mother of 11 living children, six of them born since the death of Mr. Millar, are the Toronto women who expected to claim the estate after the allotted period. Each was disappointed today, but Mrs. Brown promised a fight with the government if she should have borne the largest family by 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Senator George Lynch-Staunton, K.C., of Hamilton, expressed the opinion if the courts have not declared the will invalid, and there are no legal heirs, the action of the government “is unheard of”. The legislature can take any property in this country, he went on. “Humanly speaking, it is omnipotent.” He thought the action was not really an escheat but a confiscation, and the word confiscation “has a nasty sound”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Numerous legal luminaries in Toronto, interviewed on the legal aspects of the matter, produced wide divergence of opinion. It seemed to be generally agreed, however, that while the action was probably without any precedent, the legislature would be within its rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the credit of the Toronto press, it raised such a storm of protest that the bill was withdrawn.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>A New Leprosy Cure</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">KOREAN, Mr. Whan Tuk Chung, has perfectly cured more than fifty lepers with his medicine, named Shin Mak Whan (“Artery Pills of God”). The medicine is composed of nineteen kinds of drugs, most of which are herbs. The pills are now being analyzed, in the effort to discover the scientific reason for the cures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Chung was himself a leper; he is one of the fifty that were perfectly cured; more than twenty lepers are now under his care. So impressed is the Government that a license to market the pills, requested on August 7, 1931, was granted the same month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is interesting to hear his story. Thirty-four years ago his younger brother was overtaken with leprosy and he was broken-hearted. In the effort to try to help him he decided to study Chinese medicine, with the aforementioned good result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When he applied for a license to the governor of the Kang Won province, the police officers called on the former lepers, who are perfectly recovered, and examined them. They returned with many letters of thanksgiving to Mr. Chung, and certificates from the village master and subdistrict master. One of these letters was as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">February 9, 13th year of Taichung (1924). Whan Tuk Chung, Esq.: This is to thank you thousands of times that I am perfectly recovered from the leprosy with which I was in trouble since the first year of Taichung (1912), as a result of receiving your treatment. I will repay you in the future for your thankful merit. (Signed) Ryong Hak Choi, 25 Aninli, Kangtongmium, Kangnung district, Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Certificate: Mr. Ryong Hak Choi, 25 Aninli, Kangtongmium, Kangnung district. This is to certify that the above-named person was overtaken by leprosy but was perfectly recovered from the same after he had received the treatment of Mr. Whan Tuk Chung, Kangnungmium, Kangnung district. (Signed) Doo Pio Hong, village master of Aninli, Kangtongmium, Kangnung district, August 10th, second year of Showa (1927). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Certificate: Mr. Ryong Hak Choi, Aninli, Kangtongmium, Kangnung district. Mr. Woon Suk Lee, the same village. This is to certify that the abovementioned persons were overtaken by leprosy, but were perfectly recovered from the same after they had received the treatment of Mr. Whan Tuk Chung, of 208 Wook Chung, Kangnungmium, Kangnung district. (Signed) Chin Tong Pak, sub-district master</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">of Kangtongmium, Kangnung district, April 12th, 5th year of Showa (1930).</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Marks of Public Gratitude</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The above-mentioned more than fifty persons who recovered from leprosy by taking the Shin Mak Whan of Mr. Chung organized a Friendly Association of those who are perfectly recovered from the leprosy, and erected a stone monument on the side of a big road of the Limchung, Kangnung city, for the memorial of Mr. Chung’s merit, on which is inscribed: “A monument to remember everlastingly the merit of Master Whan Tuk Chung.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Chung is undertaking to organize the Tai Miung Dang (Great Bright House) with a capital of 10,000 yen, to cure many lepers with his licensed Shin Mak Whan. If he can get the money, then he is going to enlarge his work and will establish an asylum for free treatment for the poor lepers too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Chung said to a news editor, who asked him how he discovered such a medicine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thirty-four years ago I was studying Chinese medicine with Mr. Kiung Yil Lee of Milyang district. In October of the same year my younger brother, Whan Yung, was overtaken by leprosy. So I gathered many prescriptions for leprosy from everywhere, to treat him, but unfortunately I too was overtaken by the leprosy. I was greatly broken-hearted and left home for three years, wandering various places in search of remedies. Accidentally I discovered one kind of herb named Chun Yil Cho (thousand day plant). I added this herb to the medicine I had formerly taken, and after about one year was perfectly recovered. I then treated another person who recovered perfectly after two years. This gave me great faith in the remedy and I treated many and cured them perfectly. This is the outline of my discovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Oh how wonderful, and how thankful I am that the Lord Jehovah is moving His hands so as to make the most looked-down-upon, much abused and badly cursed people of Korea the discoverer of such a medicine, a preface to the Golden Age, when every people will say, “I am not sick.” Some may flatly refuse to believe that this is the work of Jehovah God, for it was discovered by a heathen Korean.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Compensating the Innocent</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The Japanese Government has under way a law for redressing the losses of innocent prisoners. In Japan they will be paid five yen for every day they were falsely imprisoned, while in Korea they will be paid from two to five yen. Besides, they will be given back all their seized property. The “Christian” nations might well imitate this legislation of a heathen nation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Slow Work, This</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Let nobody say that the Japanese are not as much civilized as others! In January seven Japanese completely cleaned out a bank, which they entered from the back. For forty nights they drilled with an electric drill, and every morning picked up all the steel particles with magnets. They made away with 780,000 yen; but a girl, the white slave of one of the thieves, gave them away, and in no time they were in prison.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Here in Korea we understand perfectly why the new government of Manchuria was announced on the 11th of February. That day is the anniversary of the accession of the first Japanese emperor Jimmu (“God’s military”), 2,581 years prior to A.D. 1932.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">But newer methods of constructing and operating grates has made this material all valuable. Gradually these mountains of culm have been removed; and though the miners received nothing for bringing it out of the mines, yet it has returned millions of dollars to the owners, and will bring millions more before all is used up.</span></p>

Largest in history, and it’s all yours. For service, not for profit—that’s the difference.” Then follows a financial statement compared with ten years ago. In the electric department the gross income has gone up from $214,553.98 to $677,234.41; the value of the plant and equipment has increased from $716,219.54 to $2,777,514.93. Figures are given showing that in lieu of taxes the city water, light and power department has contributed to the public $8 for every $1 that would have been obtained from a private company. In conclusion the advertisement says: “A comparison of electric rates with Rockford shows that Springfield consumers paid $723,850.00 less for the same amount of current, even though Rockford is a larger city and the rates should be less. The Illinois Power Company says it would have reduced the rates without municipal competition ; yet, in De Kalb and Sycamore, where there is no competition, the company collects more than three times as much profit on the electric current it sells than it does in Springfield, where it has competition.” Meantime, we add that the path of the lying newspapers that are owned by Big Business and used entirely to deceive and oppress the people becomes harder and harder.</span></p>

But the greater portion of this wealth found its way into the pockets of about 100,000 men. These men still have that money. They are the same men that inflated values, watered stocks and sold them to honest people of this country, robbing them of their savings. These are the same men who loaned millions of American money to foreign countries, whose securities given in return are now valued at 25c on the dollar and are uncollectible. It was these same men, who through their control of national government, manipulated every foreign loan. For years we were entertained with glowing eulogies of Andy Mellon, ‘the greatest secretary of the treasury since Hamilton.’ Now we find that during his administration he worked hand in glove with international bankers engaged in the great game of selling worthless bonds to the people for a commission. They were too shrewd to invest in such securities themselves, yet we find these foreign bonds today in the portfolios of practically every bankrupt bank in America. In Milwaukee, men who sell fake stocks and bonds are sent to Waupun prison, but the international bankers—the great blue sky racketeers in history—are not only treated with awe and respect by our federal authorities but are called upon to advise the nation in this greatest crisis.

With that, the physically able and efficient officers of the law, Grosch and Vandervoort, came to his cell and, according to his story, said to him, “If you don’t kick in with the names of the other two guys who were with you, well give you the same thing we gave Palmbo.” Mistretta was badly frightened and gave the names of Labella and Polizzi, and they were arrested. Mistretta was still badly frightened, and when Palmbo was found dead in his cell Mistretta told the district attorney about the murder. It is too bad that we have to have police officers that commit murders in cells. Somehow it seems unnecessarily impolite. It will take a little time to fix up enough lies to make it look all O.K.

Senor Alfalfa, etc., approaches the well-known banking house of Merger, Morgan and Murder of New York for a loan of twenty million dollars’ worth of brogans, overalls and bread to administer to the Uruguayan shovel stiffs whom he wants to build his road. “Sure,” say Merger, Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Murder, “we’ve got oodles of brogans, overalls and bread our subjects turned out and can’t pay for because we're paying them dimes for dollars and they can’t pay dollars for dimes. So all you’ve got to do is to sign, stamp and seal twenty million dollar bonds of the Republic of Bolivia. These bonds are drafted on that many dollars’ worth of shoes, overalls and flour our working dubs produced, but can’t buy back with what they got for producing them. We sell these drafts, or bonds, to our customers. The money is deposited to your credit in our bank. You draw on us for whatever amount of shoes, overalls and bread you need to keep your shovel stiffs on the job while building that road. The interest on the money in our bank is seven per cent per annum. The principal you get by and by is due twenty years from yesterday. The commission for floating the loan is ten per cent, and if you want a cut-in on the deal, as I’m sure you do, it’s five per cent more for good measure. Is it a go?” “It is,” says Senor Alfalfa. Shortly thereafter, solemn-faced bankers in Kalamazoo, Mich., Kokomo, Ind., and Peoria, Kans., advise depositors long on cash and short on brains to invest in government bonds of the up-and-coming Republic of Bolivia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">S</span><span class="font4">UNDAY Ave had for guests a very dear brother and sister and their beautiful 19-year-old daughter and younger son. They are people of the finest and best type. The brother is a musician by profession, specializing on the organ. With the adoption of the talkies his salary was cut $100 per month, and so on down and out. He is now trying to sell confectionery on commission. No one is on salary on that line here. Saturday he had an extra-good day and cleared $2.50. The daughter is a high-school graduate and an accomplished musician. She was glad to get a job in a ten cent store at $12 per week. They are boiling over for the truth and its service. They set me a fine example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brother gets the low-down on merchants’ fears. He finds many who tune in on the radio to hear Judge Rutherford and who are rooters for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> One big drug store in town, presenting a brave front still, has been unable to pay its $400 monthly rent for four months. Its stock is practically owned by the big fellows. There is much of this in the southwest, which appears as white on the United States Chamber of Commerce maps. There is a laudable movement to taboo the word &quot;depression”, and I surely admire the spirit of it, even though I know it will fail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">charges against Sinclair have been dropped. The Teapot Dome statesmen assembled in the good old way and went ahead as if nothing had happened. And nothing much did. Fall is back on the farm, which, for the sake of convenience, is in Doheny’s name, because Doheny was innocent and Fall was guilty. The Government might take the property away from a guilty man, but they couldn’t take it away from an innocent multimillionaire like Mr. Doheny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Democratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font4">S THE Democratic Convention always follows the Republican Convention, and as the history of a generation shows it is, to all intents and purposes, merely an annex of the Republican organization, we properly include it under the general heading here shown.

<p><span class="font9">P</span><span class="font4">OSSIBLY, when Daniel was thrown into the lions’ den, the lions did not all shut their mouths at the same instant, but one by one they closed them, just the same. Meantime, Daniel was as safe as if in his bed at home. It is something like that with the eases against Jehovah's witnesses that flare up here and there. In the end, victory is always with those who are singing the praises of the King of kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have been many obstacles placed in the pathway of the workers at Bergenfield, N. J., but after 31 of the witnesses went to prison for 10 days rather than relinquish their rights, the battle seems to have been won. A motor-cycle accident to the chief of police, resulting in the breaking of his ankle and fracturing of his skull seems to have made him less pugnacious. On the last occasion the town was served, there were no arrests, and, needless to add, there was never any reason for any of the arrests at any time. Newspaper reports were biased and malicious, for the most part, but the following, from the reputable </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">National Business Review</span><span class="font4"> (New York) of June 30, shows that there are some people with real breadth of vision who have no sympathy with the Bergenfield chief’s sorry conduct:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY MEMBERS JAILED FOR DISTRIBUTING LITERATURE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC REGRET EXPRESSED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While modern times have brought tolerance and breadth of outlook to many fields, it seems to have narrowed considerably in religious matters, as evidenced in the recent case of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Members of this well-known group have been engaged in informing the people of the meaning of this time of distress as set forth in the Bible according to Jehovah’s prophecies. They do this work in obedience to the plainly recorded command of Jehovah, the living God, as found in His Word, the Bible. They have been productive of vast good; for it is well known that an understanding of Bible truths is sadly lacking in modern life today, and their dissemination of this literature is working for a further interest in the matter by the public which cannot but be productive of beneficial results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jersey officials do not seem to think so. They arrested some 31 members of this group and have kept them in jail because they would not give information except on advice of counsel, and fined them on their release for distributing their literature without police sanction. This seems to us a regrettable instance of bungling, for this society is not commercial and does not sell its books. They are nonseetarian, working merely in the public interest for the public good. No compensation is asked at any time, and voluntary contributions to the work are restricted, the society accepting only small amounts from interested persons who wish to help them defray the cost of printing and other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a sorry time when devout persons, innocent of evil intent, and doing a real public service in accordance with the commandment of God, are forcibly restrained from their occupation, while gangsters and racketeers are allowed to wend their destructive way unmolested, merely because they have the funds and force to obtain their ends. We trust that this will be the first and last occurrence of such a nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Westfield, N. J., started in the way of Bergenfield anti arrested ten. They acted as their own lawyers, declined to pay any fines, and were given ten days in prison, being unwilling to make any compromise. While incarcerated, 100 other witnesses, giving their full names and addresses, notified the chief of police in writing that they would continue the work at Westfield the next Sunday. Forty were arrested, released on their own recognizance, and five days later the prosecutor decided not to act against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Danville, Ill., two women were arrested, and at the instance of some small-souled person, doubtless a clergyman, the lawyers of the city entered into a conspiracy not to defend the case. In their conceit they overlooked a colored lawyer, and a capital one. He took the case, presented six points of law, the prosecutor was speechless, and the judge threw the case out of court.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Revolution of Our Food Economics </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Toivo Uuskallio (Brazil)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">T IS going to happen: a revolution in our nutrition. There are pressing reasons for it. It is manifest that the trade and consumption of fruits has been greatly accelerated, especially during the last decade. Practically every one of the readers of this magazine is able to verify that fact through his own experience. Fruits are tasty and wholesome. Physicians have evolved special curative methods with the aid of fruit diets. “Eat more fruit,” they say; “use more vegetables. Eat them fresh and uncooked. Avoid meat and coffee and other stimulants if you wish to regain your health!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Heretofore, however, fruit-eating has been practiced more as a branch of curative dietetics than as a regular means of sustenance. We have the age-old habit of eating “real food”, such as meats and other foods of animal origin, and washing it down with such “bracing” liquids as coffee. We have been somewhat dubious of the nutritive value of fruits, although we have acknowledged, readily enough, the healthful results of fruit-eating. Even such a concession is better than a downright denouncement; for it constitutes an opening wedge: fruits have a way of proving their merit if they are given a chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, is it true, then, that fruits are deficient in nutritive value?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not at all. Scientific tests have proved, for instance, that in a kilogram of husked rara-nuts there are 7,080 calories of food value. Meat has an average of only about 1,500 calories, or less by nearly four-fifths; yet meat is regarded as a “substantial” food. Of course, it is an obvious mistake; if we make a study of comparative food values, we discover that meat is constituted largely of proteins and albuminoids, which do not provide the body with a great deal of fuel, although they do have tissue-building properties. Nuts, on the other hand, are mostly fats, about 70 percent, which makes them an excellent fuel-food. It may not be flattering to compare a gorilla with man; nevertheless the comparison is apt and irrefutable: gorillas subsist on nuts and vegetables. It need not be told that these creatures are far superior to man in their physical strength, even when the weight and measurements are equal. It is said that a mansized ape is from five to ten times as strong as a man; which goes to prove that fruits and vegetables must have energy-building properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the by-products of milk, butter is the most strength-containing. It has 7,700 calories to the kilogram. But even that large calory-percentage is exceeded by a kilogram of concentrated cocoafat, which has 9,100 calories. Butter is just about on a par with fresh nuts, and contains much more water; and butter alone is not a suitable stomach-filler, even if one could eat large quantities of it with great relish. Nuts, on the contrary, are quite palatable; they do not tire the mouth or the stomach, and do not result in any disagreeable consequences. In that respect they are superior to many gruels, puddings and porridges. A nut-eater will also gain a decided advantage over the fellow who depends principally on the “staff of life”, the so-called “white bread’&quot;. And, as we have pointed out, cocoa-fat contains more food value than any food derived from animal origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be said that the human body needs some nitrogenous foods: albumen, fibrin, casein, gelatine. True! But fruits do not have to take the back seat in those qualities either. Almonds contain 30 percent of albuminoids, beans have 25 percent, peas 22 percent, and even the humble and unjustly despised peanut has an albumen content of 30 percent, while meat has only 18 percent, and milk only a scant 4 percent. It is not necessary, therefore, to seek for albuminoids from the animal kingdom. Physicians prescribe almond milk to delicate infants; that alone is proof of its excellent digestive qualities. And science has proved that figs are closest to mother’s milk in their peculiar nutritive properties. Apagates are capital fruits for all-round feeding purposes, and bananas are often used for nurturing children when mother’s milk is not obtainable. Bananas are easily digestible; so are also carrots, tomatoes and various greenstuffs, all of which are cheap and plentiful, although not so nutritive as several above-mentioned food articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Citrus fruits, on the other hand, are splendid nerve tonics, together with grapes, pears, cherries, melons and many varieties of berries. They also contain much in mineral properties: iron, salts of sodium, potassium, sulphur. The high vitamin content of citrus fruits recommends them as especially good in combating the insidious bacteria of the digestive organs. In fact, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">fruit-eater never suffers from scarcity of vitamins any more than from the dearth of any other valuable substances. But in order to gain the greatest benefit from fruits and vegetables, one must remember that they must be </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">alive.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">GOT</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">By the term “alive” we mean that the organic life of our edibles must not be killed by excessive cooking and heating. Where does this habit of cooking derive from, anyway? Surely the original habitats of mankind were not equipped with kitchenettes, cooking ranges and electric percolators! No, indeed. The good “mother earth” did the cooking, and old Sol took care of the frying and broiling; and they did their job supremely well. Fruit trees and bushes worked away very assiduously and efficiently doing kitchen duty. And the results were marvelous. Everything was seasoned exactly right; everything was as delicious as anyone could wish. Conditions have not changed. Nature’s kitchens are still operating full time. But humans have forsaken nature’s products, as such. They insist on improving (!) them by heating and predigesting them. What they really succeed in doing is that they destroy a large part of the mysterious, health-giving properties of nature’s products, and eventually become slaves of their futile “culinary arts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that fruits are principally used for the sake of their juicy and refreshing qualities goes to show that there still is a lack of knowledge and experience about fruits. And why aren’t nuts used more extensively? They grow on a greater area than any other product of the earth, and they are, we have pointed out, especially beneficial as food to man. It is obvious that fruits containing as much as 85 or 90 percent of water do not have the fuel value for the body that some other foods have. But when the 90-percent fuel value of nuts is added to them, then the matter takes on a different aspect. Furthermore, it should be remembered that raising nuts is the easiest of all forms of fruit growing, as well as the most economical, in that it requires the least expenditure of capital. In fact, nut-culture constitutes a potential enterprise of immeasurable if not revolutionary possibilities in providing food for the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When mankind learns thoroughly enough the value of the right kinds of fruits, and gains proficiency in raising them in a rational way and in the right quantities, then the mania for cooking will subside automatically. Science tells us that fruits are best if eaten in their natural state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In ripe fruit the composition of the various substances, such as fats, sugar, albuminoids, etc., have blended in perfect proportions; they do not require any elaborate operations for forcing open the starchy coverings, which is the chief purpose of cooking such foods as are not edible or palatable in their original state, such as cereal grains and potatoes, the production of which is the principal objective of the farmers in our civilized countries. The last-mentioned products have shown ‘Achilles’ heel’ everywhere where they have been the mainstay of cultures emanating from dense populations. All of these various centers of culture have disappeared and left behind them nothing but desolation and deserts. That fact is easily ascertainable by the study of history together with geography. And the basic fact remains the same to our day. Slavery does not succeed for any length of time. Even in America, the New World, as it is called in Europe, large, formerly rich areas have been exhausted and impoverished with these “essential” agricultural products, with the result that additional virgin areas have to be opened up time and again to provide new fertile ground to replace the vast tracts left lean and finally barren after intensive cultivation for the “staff of life”. Consequently, forests have been ravaged and cleared away to obtain new, profitable fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most frequent misfortune that the wheat farmers have to contend with is the gradual change of climatic conditions due to the inevitable deforestation in preference of new farmlands. Forests are fundamentally necessary in order to maintain a balance in the vegetation of the earth. Wooded areas regulate and augment precipitation, climate and air currents. But when forests are destroyed, the climatic conditions become fickle and undependable. There will be long droughts, violent thunderstorms or devastating tornadoes. The earth is alternately parched and flooded. Clouds of dust float in the atmosphere in the dry seasons, and the crops suffer from a variety of ills until they ultimately shrivel into insignificance. The burning of the undergrowth in clearing away the forests did its initial damage. Then an unreasonable amount of carbohydrates was taken from the earth to provide feed for the cattle. One-quarter of livestock products went to the market; the remainder was left on the land, but its fertilizing value was not nearly enough to compensate for the drain. Hydrogen bacteria, the life-giving elements of the earth, starved to death. Such is the process of making a desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cultivation of plants or even of orchards is not sufficient to compensate the soil for the enormous loss of carbohydrates due to deforestation, grain farming and raising fodder for livestock. Robbery of the soil has been swiftest and the most ruthless on large farms where the cultivation has been done without any compensating fertilizing and where straws have been burned after harvesting. This sort of extensive cultivation of cereal grains on large areas has no future, because the process is based on violence to the soil, and not on revitalizing practices. That fact alone contains the seeds of eventual deterioration and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cultivation of comparatively large flora, on the other hand, is a blessing from every viewpoint. In fruit-growing, for example, the entire process is essentially practical. Once the trees have been planted, and subsequently well cared for, they will live for decades, in some cases for centuries, producing the best possible kind of foodstuffs for man, foodstuffs that require no elaborate preparation or cooking. At the same time, fruit plantations, even when they are dependent on irrigation, are the best means of making arid regions verdant and productive again, eventually causing the return of normal climatic conditions, inducing precipitation, and thus gradually overcoming the withering effects of even a dry climate; in other words, acting much the same way as a forest, provided, of course, that the plantations are extensive enough. In this manner man may be instrumental in assisting nature to the return of luxuriant vegetation in the erstwhile barren areas; in balancing the climate, reducing the violence of destructive air currents due to excessive variation of temperatures; and, ultimately, in making forbidding localities not only habitable but desirable. “Wide open spaces,” whether they be sandy deserts or flat prairies, become overheated in the sun, causing the air to become heated also, with the resultant elementary phenomenon in physics : fast-traveling air currents known as tornadoes, cyclones, gales, squalls, etc. But in well-regulated wooded areas the conditions are, as everyone knows, much more gentle in comparison. Meteorological observations bear out all these facts; they also bear out the unpleasant truth that denuding the earth of trees has resulted in decidedly unfavorable consequences so far as the climate and eventually the vegetation are concerned. The study of meteorology, in fact, reveals the significant fact that the climatic conditions in various parts of the globe are becoming more and more unstable, irregular and violent. And if deforestation continues unchecked in the present ruthless fashion, the entire vegetation on the globe will be seriously endangered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The revolution in the food economics of mankind is inevitable. There must be a renaissance in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">modus vivendi</span><span class="font4"> of mankind; it is being dictated by the laws of nature. A temperature of 100 degrees centigrade in converting foodstuffs into edible form is manifestly unnatural. The life contained in soil-grown edibles (whether it be called vitamins, electrons or what not, makes no difference) is essential to the life and wellbeing of genus </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Homo,</span><span class="font4"> its nerve system and its muscular development. Man can fatten himself with many substances; he can parch his tongue and corrupt his stomach with sizzling hot foods; he can also have himself cut up and patched up by surgeons, who will solemnly tell him that several organs in his body are quite superfluous and had better be removed; he can (and will, as we know) develop many wonderfid new diseases of “civilization”; but he cannot successfully contradict the immutable laws of nature without suffering the consequences. Hot food never was intended for the human stomach; hot food never made man really strong and healthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is equally obvious that we shall not for evermore be satisfied with cultivating immense areas of soil with the aid of expensive and powerful machinery against a comparatively small return and at the risk of the eventual bankruptcy of the life-giving earth. We are bound to accept the basic fact that nature is a copious provider, if we only accept her gifts as such and endeavor to facilitate her production in a rational way. We shall discover that most of our artificial methods of preparing foods are not only unnecessary, but actually harmful. Nature will make our kitchens obsolete, just as they were uncalled for in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are and will become more and more the important considerations for our future generations. Dear reader! If you would study these things in the light of your Bible, your resources of science, history, natural phenomena and practical economics, you would undoubtedly discover the secret of health and happiness, which, after all, is no secret. And if you should have, or get, the urge to venture into experimenting with fruit growing, do not hesitate for a moment. By so doing you will participate in one of the noblest of ventures: helping nature to regain her productiveness. Fruit growing and the use of fruits for food points out the road back to prosperity, physical and economical prosperity, to those who possess a wholesome outlook on life and a sturdy moral fibre and an honest desire for the search of truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Alice Foote MacDougall Coffee Shops</span></p>

The first time we heard of them they were sitting on the crest of the wave of prosperity and at least one girl who worked in one of the chain had to pay something to get her job. Her employers, doing a business of a million dollars a year, figured that at least some of the employees would get so much in tips that they would not need any salary. That seemed a mighty strange basis on which to employ help, and we made some mention of it in the news items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now comes a column article in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font4">stating that the Alice Foote MacDougall Coffee Shops are in the hands of a receiver. They have assets of $500,000 and liabilities of only $300,000, but somehow they can’t just make both ends meet. People are not clamoring now to see how fast they can spend their money. There are lots of the big people today that are feeling sick. But we only feel like laughing. 'AVeep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.” You got part of what is coming to you, and Armageddon will be along presently and finish the job. After that the poor and kind will have a chance in the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Feast of Fat Things for All People</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font4">NLY dyspeptic people would find no pleasure in looking forward to “a feast of fat things”. Only Methodist Episcopalians and other prohibitionists would look with a frown upon “a feast ... of wines on the lees well relined”. But the many men who stand in the bread lines in the large cities of the world could enjoy even the hope of such a feast. The many poor families who are furnished baskets of food by charitable associations could likewise relish even the prospect of such a feast. Their only fear might be that this feast would last for but a day or two, and then where would they get their next meal? And if human charity organizations were providing the feast, the hungry or underfed people of all nations </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font4"> have to worry about what comes after the feasting is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with much interest that we examine, in Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter twenty-five, verse six, this promise: “And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.” The Lord, Jehovah of hosts, and not the charities of men, will spread this feast. Every beast of the forest is God’s, and the cattle upon a thousand hills; all the fowls of the mountains, and the wild beasts of the field are His; the world is His, and the fullness thereof. (Ps. 50:10-12) Hence there need be no fear of scarcity of food for all people at the feast. Remembering, also, that God declares, “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts” (Isa. 55:9), we have all reason to expect that this feast provided by the Lord of hosts will be something beyond imagination, surpassing any banquet ever yet held anywhere on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IIow good it is to know that it will be for all people, and that there will not be slums and settlements of people with little or nothing to eat and at the same time rich, residential sections with more to eat than stomach can hold. Those who are well fed at the present, and not worrying about a rainy day, may feel that this feast of fat things for all people holds no special attractions for them, and that they can easily refuse the invitation to the feast without danger of going hungry or of missing anything. (Besides, they would not care to rub elbows with the common people at such a function; they would prefer to attend a banquet with the exclusive set.) But can even such people afford to treat with indifference the divine prophecy of such a feast, or suppose that they can lightly turn down God’s invitation? Jesus said of those who now live in wealth and ease: “But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger!” (Luke 6:24, 25) Jesus said also to those who came to Him for earthly bread: “Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you.” (John 6: 27) The rich and well-fed die just as surely as the hungry and poor; all their banquets and feasts and well-spread tables do not keep them alive for ever, but sometimes these things even hasten their death. However, God’s feast of fat things and wines evidently means food that both sustains and endures unto everlasting life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God spreads this banquet for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> people, forasmuch as all people, whether rich or poor, fat or lean, fed-up or hungry, need perfect health and eternal life. All are dying, and the present foodstuffs and drinks of earth do not and can not maintain life unendingly. Men have been dying ever since Adam and his wife Eve were, on account of willful sin against God, shut out of the garden of Eden, with its trees and herbs, and especially “the tree of life”. All men, except, of course, the idle rich and other loafers, have labored in the sweat of brow, but they have labored for the bread which perishes. Although the earth has brought forth abundantly and produced enough to go around for everybody, yet mankind has been literally starving for life in the midst of plenty of earthly things to eat and drink. No matter how hard man may work he can never of his own labors or inventions provide that which would feed him with perfect health and life; no matter how fabulously rich a man may be all his wealth cannot buy for him food and drink that will put into him the elements and properties of everlasting life. Men may laugh at the Bible account of the garden of Eden, but they will have to admit that they are dying, and the reason is that they are not now in that ancient garden or paradise. It was sin that brought death upon us all; Adam and Eve made themselves sinners, and all the rest of us were born such. So says the Bible. Hence eternal life can only be the gift of God, and the gift is through His sacrificed Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When, though, will God make or spread His feast? God tells us in the preceding verses of this prophecy; He declares: “It shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. 0 Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name: for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. For thou hast made of a city [that is, Satan’s world organization] an heap; of a defenced city a ruin; a palace of strangers [God’s enemies] to be no city; it shall never be built. Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee. For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones [of Satan’s organization] is as a storm against the wall. Thou [Jehovah] shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low. And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast.”—Isa. 24:21; 25:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Lord God of hosts declares that first He will fight the terrific battle of Armageddon, and break down the Devil’s wicked organization so that it will never again be established over mankind. Then he will set the wondrous feast before all men, that they may eat and live to all eternity; for, in the next two verses, the prophet adds: “And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.” This divine promise must mean that all those dead in the graves must come back to earth in order that those who weep for the dead may be comforted and that the dead as well as the living may share in God’s feast for humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what and where is “this mountain” in which the Lord God will spread this feast and wipe out death? It is not a literal mountain on earth, but it </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font4"> symbolized by Mount Zion in Jerusalem, where King David and his successors sat on the throne as kings representing God. Concerning Jesus Christ it is written (Ps. 2:6): “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” Hence the expression “this mountain” refers to God’s kingdom which He establishes through Christ Jesus over this earth. The Prophet Daniel refers to the same mountain when he describes Christ’s kingdom as a powerful stone that smites and crushes Satan’s empire: “and,” adds the prophet, “the stone that smote the image [of Satan's organization] became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”—Dan. 2: 35,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great feast is nigh at hand. The meek of the earth, by now pursuing the right course, may live to see the very beginning of the feast and to be the very first ones to eat of it and be satisfied for ever. God makes the feast for all, both the dead and the living, because He so loves our wayward race and because, as it is written, Jesus came to earth as a man, “that he by the grace of God should taste death for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font4"> man.” Jesus himself declared that His death as a fleshly creature would provide life benefits for mankind. He said: “I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your [Jewish] fathers did eat manna [in the foodless desert], and [yet] are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.”—John 6:51, 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If this is the kind and quality of food that God will serve at the feast in the mountain of His kingdom, what man or woman can afford to refuse to attend, thereby doing despite unto God’s spirit of grace and loving-kindness ? Such as do will never live forever anywhere. The loving God will see that all the dead, the Sodomites, the Gomorrheans, and all the heathen and unchristian dead, shall have an opportunity to be at the feast and to eat unto joy and life everlasting, because “there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust”. God’s apostle, Paul, states this.—Acts 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No wonder, therefore, that the Prophet Isaiah terms it “a feast of . . . fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined”. “Fat things full of marrow” are the opposite of leanness, and denote that which is exceedingly rich; and what could be richer food for our sinful, diseased and death-infected race than that which</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">will enrich them with eternal life as earthly children of God, in the human image and likeness of God? Furthermore, in the sacred Scriptures “wine” is used as a symbol of good cheer and joy in the Lord; Ecclesiastes, chapter ten, verse nineteen, says: “A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry.” Psalm one hundred four, verse fifteen, says: “Wine maketh glad the heart of man.” Wine on the lees well refined is not a newly-made wine, but is wine that has aged a long time until all impurities or lees have been deposited to be strained out, thus refining the wine, and making it of rare flavor and delicious taste. Hence, “wines on the lees well refined” is a symbol of the best and purest of joys provided by Jehovah God through Christ Jesus and for all mankind if they will accept them on God's terms. This feast which yet awaits all people was not mentioned, but is nevertheless to be understood, in that wondrous message of the angel who long ago said: “Fear not; for, behold, I bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people.” Let us, then, believe God's unfailing promise, and, though now many suffer hunger and want, let us rejoice in the blessed hope, early to be realized, of such a feast for all people and prepared by the generous hand of Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">N THE Devil’s islands, Lipari, Ponza, Tremiti and Lampedusa, where Mussolini keeps his prisoners, they are forced to rise and dress at all hours of the night, in response to the banging on their doors by the Fascist! guards. One man, a little late in arriving at the door, was imprisoned for forty-five days. Guards beat a deportee to death. Drinking water is from wells the floors of which are overrun with worms.
