<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in gloiy, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font3">come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ whieh has now begun; that the Lord’s next great net is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Blessed be the Sovereign Lord! day by day he carrieth a load for us: God himself is our salvation.&quot; —Ps. 68:19, Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the strength of his people; which means that he carries their load. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> of the above text is somewhat different from that which is just above quoted. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> reads: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily load-eth us with benefits.” The words “with benefits” are interpolated, and hence do not convey the proper meaning. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font4"> reads, “who daily bearcth our burdens,” and this and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham </span><span class="font4">rendering of the text are in full harmony with the facts. Jehovah loads himself with his people and bears their burdens. His power is used in behalf of those wfio are acting unselfishly in obedience to his will. By Jehovah are they sustained continually: “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.”— Deut. 33:27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> As Jehovah spoke to Jacob, so now he says to his faithful remnant on the earth: “Hearken unto me, 0 house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb: and even to your old age I am he: and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.” (Isa. 46:3,4) These scriptures show that Jehovah bears the load of his people in the present day. As the faithful remnant, who by his grace are named and sent forth as Jehovah’s witnesses, go from place to place giving the testimony concerning the kingdom, they find that their burdens would be too heavy for them alone to bear. With full confidence they look to Jehovah and sing the words which he has caused to be put in their mouths: “The Lord is my strength and my shield: my heart trusted in him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rcjoiceth, and with my song will I praise him. The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.”—Ps. 28:7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> About the time of the coming of the Lord to his temple the burden upon God’s people was very heavy and they grew weary and sore in trying to carry on their work the Lord had given them to do. Shortly after that time the remnant began to appreciate the precious words of this text: “God himself is our salvation.” Humiliated, oppressed and browbeaten by the agents of the adversary, which adverse treatment was made more severe by reason of the conditions accompanying the World War, the faithful people of God were discouraged and for a time ceased almost completely to give testimony concerning the Lord's purposes. Jehovah revived them by taking the load upon himself, and they then with joy began to sing: “And in that day thou slialt say O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.”— Isa. 12:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> All nations of “Christendom”, being the agents of Satan, heaped grievous burdens upon G jd’s people, and these conditions and what shortly followed were foreshadowed and foretold by the words of God’s prophet: “All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord will I destroj’ them. Thou hast thrust sore at me, that I might fall: but the Lord helped me. The Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.” (Ps. 118:10,13,14) The remnant then began to appreciate God’s kingdom and their privilege of serving it, and this “faithful servant” class spoke the words put in their mouths by the prophet of God: “Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee; for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.”— Ps. 118:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In 1922 God's devoted people began to appreciate that there was a great witness work to be done and that the Lord had committed to these faithful servants the privilege of giving this testimony to men. Therefore they sing: “This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.”— Ps. 118:24.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">131</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Knowing that the enemy would shower his wicked darts upon them and that a stiff fight would follow, but that they could confidently depend upon Jehovah to carry their load, the faithful continue to pray: “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.”—Ps. 118: 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> The time of complete triumph of righteousness was seen to be near at hand, and the faithful, from that time forward until now, have sung in the language of this Psalm: “Blessed be the name of the Lord, from this time forth and for evermore.”— Ps. 113:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> As the mountains surrounding the city of Jerusalem furnished a natural protection to the city, so God’s faithful remnant saw that the kingdom now being brought forward would furnish for them the complete protection by God’s grace from that time and forevermore: “They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. ’ ’—Ps. 125:1,2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD FOR US</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> The life of King David was a militant one. He was sorely pressed by the relentless enemy. David could therefore well say for himself and for the people of Israel, for whom he stood, the words of the twentieth verse of this Psalm, to wit: “He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death.” Another rendering of the text makes it appear even more appropriate to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus whom David foreshadowed: ‘ ‘ God is unto us a God of deliverances; and unto JEHOVAH the Lord belong the issues from death.” (R.P.) “God himself is for ua a God of saving deeds, and to Jehovah Sovereign Lord belong escapes in view of death.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The experiences through which God's people passed from 1917 until about the close of 1919 were very severe and trying. Following the deliverance that came to them in 1919 the people that were fully trusting in Jehovah and his King could well say: ‘God himself is for us, the God of saving deeds.’ The faithful had been delivered from sin and death by reason of the value of the shed blood of Christ Jesus. (Rom. 8:1) Not only was this true, but they had now been delivered from Satan’s organization and from the death with which that wicked one and his organization intended to dcstrov them. To these faithful ones Jehovah revealed that wicked and hideous organization of Satan. They saw it and hated it with a godly hatred and became anxious to expose its wickedness before mankind. They saw Jehovah’s organization and rejoiced because they had been brought into it, had received the garments of salvation, which identified them as members of God’s organization, and had been covered by the robe of righteousness, denoting Jehovah's approval of them. They had entered into the joy of their Lord, and then they took up the glad Song to the praise of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Unto Jehovah the Sovereign Lord belong escapes in view of death. After the very terrible and trying experiences during the World War these words were and are very fitting for the faithful remnant to utter. Their witness work had been stopped, and to many persons they appeared as dead. “And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city.” But Jehovah had prepared an escape or issues or exits out of that dead condition, and one of these was that which God had caused to be set forth in Revelation: “And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.” (Rev. 11:11) (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 205.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> At the present time the Haman class is conspiring and cooperating with Satan and other parts of his wicked organization to bring about the death of the faithful remnant, pictured by Mordecai and Esther. Later the people of God, when more severely persecuted, may well say that ‘God himself is for us; unto him belongs the escape in view of death’, and that escape Jehovah foretold by the destruction of Haman; and the escape of his people will come with the destruction of the class pictured by Haman, and particularly will this escape be made available at Armageddon. The complete escape, however, is the victory of the faithful that will be gained over death and the grave when these partake of the resurrection of Christ Jesus. Looking forward to that issue or escape in view of death the Apostle Paul exclaimed: “If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.” (Phil. 3:11) Jehovah God is for those who love him, and all these he will preserve. (Ps. 145: 20) “If God be for us, who can be against us?” (Rom. 8:31) “The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me? The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me. It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man.” (Ps. 118:6-8) These precious words of promise not only encourage the remnant but increase their joy, and they delight to press the battle to the gate and to do so without fear of man or devil. The faithful know that God’s kingdom is here and that now he will vindicate his name and that all who maintain their integrity towards him will receive his complete deliverance and blessing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS FAITHFUL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The enemy must go down, but not by the hand of man. “But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.” (Vs. 21) Satan is the great enemy and the head of his powerful organization which is composed of visible and invisible creatures, all of whom are enemies of God. Not only will Satan suffer defeat in the battle of Armageddon, but his head, and the head of all of God’s enemies that go to make up the wicked organization, shall be cracked wide open. Christ Jesus and his army, invisible to human eyes, will do the slaughtering work, and Jehovah God will be at his right hand and be his everlasting support. Therefore it is written, in Psalm 110:5,6: “The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.&quot; God’s people are fully assured that the victory is with Jehovah and his beloved King, and for their encouragement he has caused to be written: “Behold, the whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind; it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.”—Jer. 30:23,24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The latter half of the twenty-first verst, according to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font4"> reads: “The hairy crown that goeth on in his guilty deeds.&quot; This describes Satan in particular, but includes also his chief human agencies in the earth. “They know not, neither will they understand [although notice has been served upon them]; they walk on in darkness.&quot; (Ps. 82:5) They rush on in a more bullheaded and rapid gait than ever. They froth at the mouth and paw the dust. This is further proven by the fact that sinee the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> booklet amongst the clergy they are more wrathy and vehement in their denunciation of God’s kingdom than ever before. It is also proven by the fact that since the judgment of the Lord began in 1918 crime and oppression have increased throughout the earth, and particularly in the land called &quot;Christendom&quot;. The words “the hairy crown that goeth on” show that these heads of Satan’s organization, including himself, have given no heed to the repeated warnings and that they show no grief because of their trespasses and guilty deeds, which was symbolized by the shaving of the hair off the top part of the head. (Jer. 7:29) “Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.&quot; (Rev. 9:21) Although duly warned, they do not repent. ‘ ‘ And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.” (Rev. 16:11) When the warning to the enemy organization has been fully completed, then those who have refused to hear must bear all responsibility. Their blood is upon their own heads. (Ezek. 3:19) There are those who claim to be devoted to the Lord but who fail aqd refuse to join in the work of giving warning and the testimony which God has commanded, and to tell of the judgment of Jehovah upon the wicked organization; and concerning such it is written: “When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.&quot; (Ezek. 3:18) (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication.)</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah God has given his “Word”, which includes the message concerning the day of his vengeance, and his faithful witnesses must publish that Word, that they might maintain their integrity toward Jehovah and prove faithful to the end. Jesus makes it clear that, when this work is done, then “God will shatter the head of his foes”, drenching the earth with blood as never before was known and never will be again.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DELIVERANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Bashan was a land of oppression and pictured Satan and his wicked, oppressive organization. God’s people have long been in that land or condition of oppression and subjected to much oppression together with others. God will first deliver his own people; therefore the psalmist says: “The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring them again from the depths of the sea.&quot;—Vs. 22, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The use of the word “again&quot; twice in this verse shows that it applies to the remnant, or God’s anointed “servant&quot; class. The first time God brought his covenant people from Bashan is described in Numbers 21: 33, 34, when the Lord, by the hand of Moses, fought the battle of Edrei and cleaned out the enemy. Bringing his people “again&quot; from Bashan would refer to Jehovah’s delivering his people after 1918 from Satan's organization, which is symbolized by Bashan. He brings his people by the “highway&quot; into his own organization. As God gave Israel the victory over Og, the king of Bashan, even so the remnant, under the leadership of Christ, by the grace of God have been delivered from Satan's organization and have alreadj' gotten the victory over the beast, his image, his mark, and the number of his name. (Rev. 15:2; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, pages 14, 15.) The remnant were in the temple when they discerned this great truth, and therefore they lifted up their voices in songs of praise of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> When Jehovah, by the hand of Moses, led the Israelites out of Egypt he delivered them from the depths of the Red sea; hence the w<sup>r</sup>ords of the Psalm, “again from the depths of the sea.&quot; This shows that there is to be another deliverance, whieh was foreshadowed by the deliverance of Israel. This deliverance by the “highway” began after 1919, when God's people saw the two great opposing organizations and took their stand wholly on the Lord’s side and became a part of his organization. God provided the highway for them; hence it is written: “And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.” (Isa. 11; 16)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">When God’s people began to appreciate this deliverance they began also to sing: ‘ ‘ And in that day thou shall say, 0 Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wasl angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and doest comfortedst me.” (Isa. 12:1) Again God’s prophet proclaims this deliverance of the remnant, in these words: ‘ ‘ Awake, awake, put on thy strength, () Arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it [the arm of the Lord] that hath cut Rahab [Egypt, Satan’s organization], and wounded the dragon [in the Nile river] ? Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the [Red] sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return [from Bashan, Babylon, Satan’s organization], and come with singing unto Zion [God’s organization]; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head; they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass.” (Isa. 51: 9-12) The remnant is now at the front on the “highway”, singing the praises of Jehovah God and his kingdom and publishing to the people of the world that Jehovah is the only God and that his kingdom is their one and only hope.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Bringing his consecrated people into Zion his organization shows God’s purposes to give them some part in the vindication of his name. Therefore the Psalm-Song reads: “That thou mayest dip [bathe] thy foot in blood, that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.” (Vs. 23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.) </span><span class="font4">Undoubtedly the reference here is to Christ and corresponds with Revelation 19:13: “And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God.” The last members of the Christ body on earth are the remnant, and are undoubtedly represented here by “thy foot”; and this seems to be another indication that the faithful remnant, or at least some of them, will be on the earth during the great battle of Armageddon and witness the blood that shall flow by reason of Christ Jesus’ executing the enemy. In harmony with this it is written concerning Christ Jesus; ‘Thou treadest the great winepress of the wrath of God.’ (Isa. 63:1-6) The remnant, seeing the vengeance of God made manifest upon the enemy, will have further reason to greatly rejoice and praise his name. “The righteous [the remnant] shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance [of Jehovah] : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked [which shows that blood shall flow like water]. So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judg-eth in the earth.”—Ps. 58:10,11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Instead of the blood-shedding at Armageddon being merely symbolic, as those who now live at ease say and would have it, great will be the actual flow of blood, as shown by this and other scriptures: ‘ ‘ And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.” (Zeph. 1:17) “Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains [Satan’s world powers] shall be melted with their blood.”— Isa. 34:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> That the terrible slaughter upon earth will be more terrible than ever before experienced is further suggested by the phrase “that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies”. There is every reason to believe that this will have a literal and far-reaching fulfilment with the savage dogs gone mad. The enemies of God will be food for the scavengers. God’s law says: ‘Any flesh that is torn of the beast of the field ye shall cast to the dogs.’ (Ex. 22:31) Such is not viewed as holy flesh, and the death of such is not precious in the sight of Jehovah God. The fate of Jezebel also supports this conclusion. Jezebel foreshadowed the wicked organization of Satan, and concerning her it is written that Jehu said: “Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot. . . . And they went to bury her; but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.”—2 Ki. 9:32-36.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROCESSION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are now on the trek, and as they go their song is heard: “They [men] have seen thy goings, 0 God; even the goings of my God, my King, in [R.V., into] the sanctuary.” (Vs. 24) As heretofore observed in the seventeenth verse of this Psalm, according to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> it appears: “The Sovereign Lord Lath come from Sinai into the sanctuary”; that is to say, Jehovah moves from typical Sinai to Mount Zion, the real situation of his kingdom, and to his temple. There was a miniature or typical fulfilment. There is now the real and complete fulfilment of the prophecy. When the Israelites marched from Sinai through the various deserts and countries to the promised land, where the mountain of the Lord was located, the priests carried the ark of the covenant on their shoulders, showing Jehovah riding before and leading his people and performing the acts of deliverance openly in behalf of his people. Then the nations did as the Psalm says, ‘saw thy goings, 0 God. ’ Later when King David had the ark of the covenant brought up to and placed in the tent on Mount Zion, and accompanied by a grand procession of joyful, singing people, “they [the men]” saw in a small way ‘ ‘ the goings of my God, my King, into the sanctuary”, and which foreshadowed the larger fulfilment to come later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> That which was then seen was a fulfilment in a miniature way and is now being fulfilled in a worldwide way. Although 1918 marked the coming of Jehovah by his chief representative Christ Jesus to the temple, the priests are still marching with increased zeal and joy. The remnant class that faces toward the temple on Mount Zion enters the gates of the kingdom, and these are streaming through the various countries of the world and joyfully proclaiming that Jehovah is in his holy temple and hence all the world should keep silence before him. (Hab. 2:20) Therefore the remnant, composed of creatures with human organisms, are the first ones to see “the goings” of Jehovah and his Messenger of the covenant into the sanctuary. This the remnant began to see about 1922. (See Isaiah 6:1, 2.) Others must see this great procession later. The procession of God’s happy marching company is described in the following verse: “The singers went before, the minstrels followed after, in the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.”—Vs. 25, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> The typical marching procession is described in the following language: “And Dav’d spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of music, psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song, with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. ’ ’—1 Chron. 15:16, 27, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> The twenty-seventh verse states that David had upon him an ephod of linen. That pictured the robe of righteousness of divine approval with which the anointed are now clothed. The singers as a unit had the message to sing, and together they sang praises with understanding, as it is written: “For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. ” (Ps. 47: 7) Failing to sing with understanding would mean a mere noise. God’s people now in the temple and in the procession marching to the kingdom are singing with understanding; therefore, they having the message of the Lord and singing it in unison, it is a glad song of harmony and praise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> This prophecy concerning the procession correctly describes in symbol the facts as they exist at the present time. Ever since the coming of the Lord to the temple in 1918, even though his coming to the temple was and is for judgment, it is an occasion, not for sorrow, but for great joy on the part of all who love righteousness. This joy begins with such as soon as they come to a knowledge of the fact that Christ Jesus has taken his great power and begun his reign and that thus Jehovah is beginning his judgment upon Satan’s organization, and the establishment of his government of righteousness. Therefore the psalmist sings: ‘ ‘ Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.” (Ps. 96:11-13) (See also Psalm 98: 6-9.) The singers at the present time take on the form of a world-wide effort to show forth the praises of Jehovah God and to testify to his name and to his mighty acts. The procession of singers is making publicity of the name of Jehovah and of his kingdom. “The joy of the Lord” furnishes them strength so to do. As the procession marches forward they are approaching the vindication of Jehovah's name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2G</sup> When the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, that was a reproach to Jehovah’s name. (1 Sam. 4:10,11,22) The ark of the covenant was a plague to the Philistines, and within a short time they returned it to the possession of the Israelites; but it was not placed in the tabernacle which Moses, under the direction of Jehovah, had built for it, but it remained elsewhere for a period of more than sixty years. All the time it remained in the house of Abin-adab of Judah and in the house of Obed-edom, the name of Jehovah was still under reproach and not vindicated, because the ark of the covenant was not in his temple. But when it was brought with a triumphant procession and placed on Mount Zion, the capital hill at Jerusalem, in the royal tent or tabernacle, then Jehovah’s name was to that extent vindicated. The ark there, representing the presence of Jehovah, pictured the building up of Zion and the appearing of Jehovah in his glory, and which time is marked by great joy and singing of his praises. (Ps. 102:16, 21) Jehovah loves the gates of Zion because, symbolized by his woman, it represents his organization which has to do with the vindication of his word and name. “The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her; and the Highest himself shall establish her. As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee. ’ ’—Ps. 87: 2, 5, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> In the Psalm-Song (68:25) mention is made of “damsels playing with timbrels”, which fact proves that the great world-wide witness work must be delivered “in that day”, where we now are, and that it is not to be delivered merely by male singers or men as the witnesses of the Lord, but that the work will be and is being engaged in by females according to the flesh. The facts are that many females or women, sisters in the Lord, are now actively and daily engaged in the service of the Lord and form a part of the procession (antitypical) of the marching singers who proceed to sing the praises of Jehovah’s name. This is a further confirmation of the prophecy that ‘the spirit of God would be poured out on all flesh’ regardless of sex and that the “daughters” as well as the “sons” should engage in prophesying or publishing the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. The physical facts are true to the words of the prophecy; and those who love the Lord now see that these facts fully fit the prophecy, and such is an encouragement and increased reason of joy to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CELEBRATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The time must come when the anointed people of God will come into “the unity of the faith . . . : that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness, . . . but [all] speaking the truth in love”. (Eph. 4:13-15) That condition must obtain after the coming of the Lord to his temple and before the remnant is taken from the earth. That time is now here; therefore there must be unity of faith and action on the part of God’s remnant wherever they may be situated. That means that the entire company of the anointed remnant will be moving forward shoulder to shoulder, doing with joy the work which God has given them to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Ever and anon in this day there arise some in the company of God’s people who wish to do all their talking at the meetings of the company and who use their influence to retard the field service. They wish to dominate the service meetings, but do no actual service. Such have not the spirit of the Lord and manifestly are not born of God's organization, and hence are not in unity with the Head of God’s organization, Christ Jesus. If they were in line for the kingdom they would now be in full harmony and not only ‘willing in this day of the Lord’ but joyfully participating in the work of publishing God’s great name and his kingdom. Those who have come to the unity of the faith, as described by the apostle, not only see eye to eye, but are anxious to work in full harmony to carry out God’s commandments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> The foregoing paragraph concerning the unity of the anointed is fully supported by the twentysixth verse of the Psalm, which according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ke-vised Version</span><span class="font4"> reads: “Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, ye that are of the fountain of Israel.” These congregations, here mentioned by the psalmist, as related to Israel, assembled and formed in the court before the tabernacle, wherein was the ark of the covenant, and thus they pictured those whom Christ Jesus has now gathered unto himself into the temple. (John 14:1-3; 2 Thcss. 2:1) The work of the temple class, which is that of giving testimony to the name of Jehovah, must therefore be done’in unison by a united company. The foundation of Israel is Jehovah, “the fountain of living waters.” (Jer. 2:13; 17:13) Jehovah is the great “well of salvation” out of which the Israel of God, the “faithful servant” class, now draw the waters of salvation. (Isa. 12:3) The “elect servant” is made up of Jehovah’s sons, who are members of the royal temple. This royal family is gathered into the temple. They are of Zion, and therefore together they sing, “All my springs are in thee.” (Ps. 87:7) All in the temple celebrate the happy condition, and this they do by all speaking to the glory of God. (Ps. 29:9) They do not speak of the glory and honor of any creatures, particularly of any elders that have desired to shine and to receive honor from men. All such should take full notice of this plain statement of the Scriptures; and those who have ambitiously desired to shine should amend their ways and get in the ranks of the active service and remember that there is no distinction now of those who are in the service of Jehovah, because all are together, acting as one, and all are one. These together bless Jehovah or praise him, and this they do by faithfully obeying his commandments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> Verse twenty-seven of the Psalm gives further proof that all in Christ must now be in full harmony and acting together in unison. “There is little Benjamin their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.” (R.V.) The word “council” appearing in the text is in the margin rendered “company”. According to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> the twenty-seventh verse reads: “There is Benjamin the Diminutive, ruling them [the conqueror, margin].” Benjamin was called by Saul (who was a Benjamite) “the smallest of the tribes of Israel”. (1 Sam. 9:21) Therefore while Saul reigned as king in Israel, Benjamin was representatively the ruler of Israel; and probably for that reason Jehovah inspired David and mentioned Benjamin in the Song-Psalm. Among the one hundred and forty-four thousand who go to make up the royal house of Jehovah, and who stand with Christ Jesus upon Mount Zion, there is, according to the scripture, twelve thousand represented by the tribe of Benjamin, all of which, to be sure, must be “conquerors” or “more than conquerors” in Christ Jesus. (Rom. 8: 37) Concerning all of these it is written: “And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great.” (Rev. 19:5) All those who are true Judeans must be there among the company of God’s approved ones and must be giving praise to Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> The Psalm also mentions the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali. The land assigned to these two tribes is known as Galilee, where Jesus began to preach “The kingdom of heaven is at hand”. Isaiah prophesied of Jesus that ‘a great light was coming to the land of Zebulun and Naphtali’, and Jesus fulfilled that prophecy. “Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; . . . From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4:12-17) Therefore the mention of the two tiibes in connection with the preaching of Jesus after the beheading of John the Baptist fixes the time of the fulfilment of the prophecy, and may well represent those who heard and came to a knowledge of the truth and became a part of the remnant after 1919.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Judah and Benjamin correspond with and very well picture the Mordecai class, which stood faithful for the kingdom when others forsook it and took their own selfish course, while Zebulun and Naphtali may well picture the Esther class that came to a knowledge of the truth and into Christ after the antitypical beheading of John the Baptist. The tribes Zebulun and Naphtali were toward the extreme north of Palestine, and Judah and Benjamin had the southern part thereof, and the other tribes were in the land between. This would suggest that all the twelve spiritual tribes are in this company which celebrate the Lord’s coming to his temple, and all of whom together proclaim the praises of Jehovah God and publish his name and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE MOST HIGH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH God is supreme. From him proceeds all rightful authority. (Rom. 13:1) His Word is true. (John 17:17) He is the great First Cause and is the Creator of heaven and earth. (Isa. 42: 5) He made the earth by his power. (Jer. 10:12) He is the Almighty God, which means that there is no limitation to his power. (Gen. 17:1-3; 35:11) He is therefore the Most High above all.—Ps. 91:1; Eph. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is just. He deals justly and his determinations are always right. (Ps. 89:14) “He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. ” (Deut. 32:4) He is a just and mighty God besides whom there is none other. (Isa. 45: 21) Being absolutely just he can do no wrong and therefore could not show special favor to some at the expense and rights of others. In him there is no partiality.—Jas. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is wise. His wisdom is perfect. In wisdom he created the heavens and the earth and all things therein. (Ps. 104:10-24; 136:5; Prov. 3:19) He is the source of wisdom.—Prov. 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is love. (1 John 4:16) Perfect unselfishness is expressed in all his actions. In God is found the complete expression of unselfishness. God hates that which is evil, and particularly pride, lies, a false witness, and the hand that sheds innocent b'ood, and that which is oppressive. (Prov. 6:16-19; Ps. 97:10) All the ways of the Lord God are true and right. All his ways are equal. (Ps. 33:4) “His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever. He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.”—Ps. 111:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The four primary attributes of Jehovah God are, therefore: power, justice, wisdom and love. These attributes always operate in exact harmony and for the ultimate benefit of all of his creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The supreme power of control over the governments of earth always has been invisible to man and always will be. The entire organization is termed “world”. There is an invisible part of the world, and there is a visible part; and the invisible exercises the supreme power. “World” means men organized into forms of government under the supervision of the invisible overlord, which overlord exercises the power of control. A spirit creature is not visible to human eyes. (John 3: 6) Jehovah God is the great Spirit invisible to human eyes. (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Tim. 6:16) While Jehovah God is supreme, and in him dwells all rightful power and authoritj-, yet from time to time he delegates power and authority to his creatures. Such delegated power, to be properly used and exercised, must be exercised in harmony with the will of Jehovah God. If exercised contrary to the will of God it is wrongfully exercised. These unalterable truths just stated must be considered in connection with the cause of unsatisfactory governments of earth and the remedy therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created man, whom he called Adam, a perfect creature. That perfect man’s invisible ruler was Jehovah God, his Creator. To that man God gave dominion over the earth and over its animal creation. By accepting these favors and blessings there was an implied covenant on the part of man to be obedient to God’s commandments. Jehovah God appointed an overlord for man, to wit, his son Lucifer, a spirit creature invisible to man, and designated in the Scriptures as one of the “morning stars”. (Job 38: 7) Jehovah God delegated to Lucifer the power and authority over perfect man to be man's overlord; but that delegated power and authority, to be rightfully exercised must be exercised in strict harmony with God’s will, and the governor must be loyal to Jehovah God. The divine arrangement required man to be obedient to God’s laws and also required Lucifer to be obedient thereto. Both Lucifer and perfect man knew that such was required of them. Both knew that God had announced the penalty of death to be inflicted upon man should he willfully violate God’s law. (Gen. 2:17) Lucifer had an ambitious desire to have man all to himself that he might receive the homage and worship from man and that he might be like unto and equal to the Most High. He represented to Eve that the stated death penalty for a violation of Ged’s law was not true. He induced Eve to violate that law. Through Eve Adam was led to violate God’s law. This wrongful act called down upon Adam the penalty of death. God must be consistent and vindicate his own law. By the wrongful act of Lucifer and man’s violation of God’s law man was alienated and separated from God. (Gen. 3: 3-19) Man therefore lost his dominion and his right to life and was expelled from his perfect home. Thereafter</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer was designated by four names, Dragon, Satan, Serpent and Devil, which names signify that he is a devourer, the enemy and opposcr of God, a liar and deceiver, and the slanderer of God and all who try to do right.—Rev. 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one has a throne, that signifies that he is invested with certain power and authority. It is written concerning Lucifer, who has since been called Satan the Devil: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 1 will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” (Isa. 1-1:13,14) This scripture proves that Lucifer had a throne and was therefore clothed with certain power and authority. Having received his power and authority from Jehovah God he would continue to exercise it until deprived thereof by him who granted it. The Scriptures further prove that this authority was over man, who was then in Eden the garden of God, and that such authority was delegated by Jehovah. “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.”— Ezek. 28:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These scriptures prove that all supreme power resides in Jehovah God; that God delegated to Lucifer the power and authority as overlord of man; that Lucifer was and is invisible to man; that Lucifer afterward became Satan and is designated under that and the other names applied to him; and that he would continue to exercise his delegated power and authority until God withdraws or takes it away from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be sure, God could have withdrawn all power and authority from Satan immediately upon his deflection and not have permitted him to further influence man. His wisdom directed otherwise. Man had willingly turned away from his great loving Creator and had lost his right to live and his right to dominion. Would man now seek to return to God’s favor, or would he prefer to yield to the influence of Satan? The great issue from that time forward became: Who is supreme, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil? God would give man the opportunity to choose between Himself, the Righteous One, and Satan, the evil one. Adam chose to yield to Satan the Devil. All of his children were born in sin and shapen in iniquity and therefore alienated from God by reason of Adam’s wrongful act. (Ps. 51:5; Rom. 5:12) Some of Adam’s descendants, however, chose to obey and serve God. Abel, Enoch and Noah were of those who thus desired righteousness. The majority of men Satan led in the way of opposition to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now the question is, Who is responsible for the governments of men that have existed and now exist upon the earth? That question can best be answered by a brief examination of the leading governments that have been upon earth. The facts show that with but two exceptions none of these have been God’s governments and that the invisible control over them has been exercised by Satan the Devil. It is true that at all times there have been a few men who have desired to be obedient to God, but these have always been decidedly in the minority. Satan by fraud and deception has led many to believe that at least part of the governments of this world have been God’s governments, and hence to charge Jehovah God with the responsibility therefor. Seeing that God is the possessor of almighty power, that he is just and right, that his wisdom is perfect, that he is love, it follows that any government which God would establish would be consistent with himself, because God cannot be inconsistent, nor can he deny himself. (Mal. 3:6) If the facts show that the governments have been founded and conducted contrary to God’s way, then that of itself would be proof that God is not responsible for such governments and that he is not the author thereof.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE GOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">OME who claim to be Christians and to preach the Word of God openly champion the theory of the evolution of man. By so doing such have</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">become the instruments of Satan the Devil. They are being used by Satan to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah. These dupes of Satan have pushed their evolution theory to the fore in the colleges and universities and even into the public schools. By thus doing they have largely succeeded in destroying the faith of the rising generations in God and his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is another wily move of the Devil to turn the minds of the people away from the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan is the great wicked one who blinds the minds of men lest the truth should shine into their hearts. For a Christian to indulge in a serious discussion of the truth or falsity of such a theory means to give countenance and consideration to the Devil and his wicked course. A man who has consecrated himself to God and learns of the precious truths disclosed in his Word, and who then turns to evolution and advocates it as an explanation of man’s origin, thereby becomes the child of Satan. To encourage such a one in a debate as to -whether or not man is a creature of evolution is to commit sin. The prophet of God, who spoke as the representative of Christians, stated: “I will keep my mouth -with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.”—Ps. 39:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The duty of the Christian is to teach the truth and not even listen to lies against Jehovah, much less to engage in a discussion as to whether or not they are true. God has appointed and anointed the Christian to proclaim the good news of his provision of redemption to those who are teachable and will hear. He has commissioned such to bind up the broken-hearted and comfort all that mourn and who desire to be comforted. (Isa. 61:1,2) It would therefore be impossible for the Christian to fulfil that commission unless he believes that God created man perfect and that sorrow, sickness, and death resulted from sin; that God in his loving-kindness has provided redemption for</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>OF TRUTH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">man by the death and resurrection of his beloved Son; and that in God’s due time he will restore the obedient ones of mankind to the state of perfection enjoyed by the man whom God created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christian is called upon to be a faithful and true witness for God and not to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the promulgation of that which is a repudiation of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The theory of evolution of man not only is evil, but is unworthy to have a place in the mind of the child of God even for a moment and should be repulsed by all who are loyal to God. The proper course of a Christian in matters pertaining to such evil philosophy as evolution is plainly pointed out by the apostle: ‘‘Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. ’ ’—Col. 2: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon this same point the Christian is instructed: ‘‘Receive as a friend a man whose faith is weak, but not for the purpose of deciding mere matters of opinion.” (Rom. 14:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth')</span><span class="font4"> Another translator renders this text thus: “Now receive to yourselves the weak in the faith; not, however, for doubtful reasonings.” (Rom. 14:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> To the same effect the prophet of God wrote the words that apply to the Christian at this time: “For thy lovingkind-ness is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy truth. I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.” —Ps. 26: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No one can enter into a discussion with an evolutionist concerning the origin of man without violating this scripture. Such disputor against the Word of God is a vain person. He is an evil doer; particularly if he has once been enlightened or professes to be a preacher of God’s Word and then advocates evolution, he is wicked. Then the psalmist adds: “I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, 0 Lord; that I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.&quot;— Ps. 26:6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the same effect the prophet wrote: &quot;I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. ” (Ps. 119:113) And then the same prophet states that which is proper for the meditation and consideration of the Christian: &quot;I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.”—Ps. 119:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But it will be asked, Do not most of the clergymen endorse the evolution theory as to man? Are not these clergymen learned men, and for this reason is not the theory they advocate entitled to full consideration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To their shame they do endorse and advocate evolution. If they are learned they are learned in vain philosophy and not in the Word of God. If they were once learned in the Word of God and have since adopted the theory of evolution, that of itself is proof that they have become wicked within the meaning of the Scriptures and are therefore instruments of the Devil and the enemies of God. Because of their supposed learning and high reputation among men as having wisdom the clergymen have done more than any other class of men to destroy faith in the Bible as the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From Eden till now Satan’s policy has been to turn the people away from Jehovah. To accomplish his purposes he has resorted to all kinds of vain philosophy and foolish reasoning. In this he has induced men to believe themselves wise. They are ambitious to appear wise before their fellow creatures. God could have prevented Satan from thus influencing men or he could have destroyed him and his false theory. The fact that he has not done so is proof that it is not God’s due time to do so. He does state that in due time all the wicked he will destroy. The fact that God has not prevented the promulgation of this wicked doctrine is a sufficient reason why it is not now the duty of a Christian to enter into the discussion thereof with men about its truth or falsity with the hope or expectation of destroying that wicked doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Evolution of man is one of the evils the Devil has taught to men; and God has not prevented it. Now is the day for the Christian to declare the message of God’s kingdom and to tell the people that in his own due time God will clear the earth of all evil theories and practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let no Christian now waste his time and effort by being drawn into a controversy with some of the Devil’s agents as to whether or not God is a liar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Christian is now to sound forth the message of truth to the praise of Jehovah’s name. Let the Christian be content with telling the people that the evolution theory concerning man is one of the Devil’s lies and to show it as destructive to faith in God and in his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christian must let it be known that he stands firmly upon the Word of God and that he refuses to enter into a controversy or discussion with anyone who denies Jehovah and denies his Word of truth. Before such he is to keep his mouth with a bridle or remain silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in the days of Enos, who was only one generation removed from Adam, that the Devil organized men into bodies or societies calling themselves by the name of the Lord. (Gen. 4:26, margin) That was the beginning of hypocrisy, because these men called themselves by the name of the Lord in derision of the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan has seen to it that hypocrisy has grown among mankind. Doubtless there never was a time when there was so much hypocrisy in the world as at the present day. By far the majority of the clergymen posing as the representatives of Jehovah call themselves preachers of the Word of God, and represent themselves as the only teachers of true religion, and at the same time openly advocate the doctrine of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergyman who stands in his pulpit and represents himself to the people as the servant of God and of Jesus Christ and at the same time advocates the theory of evolution as related to man, is openly teaching Satan’s lie and practicing that falsehood. Such men have itching ears and a desire to have it said of and concerning them that they are great and wise. Their selfishness, pride and ambition have led them into Satan’s trap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be it noted that the theory that man is a creature of evolution is a modern theory and advanced by modern clergymen who even call themselves by the name &quot;modernists”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Foreknowing that this blight would fall upon Christians God caused his inspired witness to write to Christians thus: ‘ ‘ For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. ’ ’— 2 Tim. 4: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor was there any doubt left as to what is the proper course of the true Christian in this time and what is his proper attitude toward such instruments of evil. It is plainly written concerning them: &quot;From such turn away.&quot; A Christian who obeys this command cannot indulge in discussion of the theory of evolution concerning man. Bearing upon the same point the inspired apostle further wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. ’ ’— 2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These modern savants are drunken with the desire for the approval of men and for power among men. Their pride and ambition have caused them to go blind. If they ever had any vision of God’s purpose they have lost it. They now put forward their own wisdom in opposition to the wisdom of God. Among themselves they say: ‘God did not make man, but man made himself. We are wiser than the ignorant men who wrote the Bible. We now express our wisdom. Neither man nor God can call in question our wisdom.’ The foolishness of these self-conceited wise men has turned millions of minds away from the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Could not God have prevented such evil influence of the Devil and have restrained these men from teaching such falsehoods ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be sure he could; but he has permitted the evil in this, that he has not prevented it. God foreknew and foretold the very course these modernists or evolutionists would take, and therefore he caused his prophet to write these words, which apply at the present time: “Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is scaled. And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned. Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid. Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He hath no understanding?’’—Isa. 29: 9-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this prophecy the Lord has foretold that the wisdom of these modernists is of but short duration. The time has come for the name of the Lord Jehovah to be exalted in the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>NEED FOR A RIGHTEOUS GOVERNMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font4">HE World War wrought such terrible havoc that the people were anxious to adopt a method that would prevent another great war. Men upon whom the responsibility rested to do something concluded that a league or compact of the principal nations of the world would accomplish the desired result. The league was formed. Many nations entered into that compact, while others declined to enter it; and an effort has been put forth to establish such a relationship between the nations that all controversies may be settled without war. The League of Nations has not bettered the world. It cannot better the governments, and it cannot prevent war. It has never succeeded in establishing ideal conditions amongst the people on earth, and cannot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Acting in accord with the announced purpose of the League of Nations, conferences have been held looking to the disarmament of the various nations and countries and thus to make war impossible. The United States did not openly enter the League of Nations, but did in conference agree to the destruction of its battleships to the value of five hundred million dollars which had been paid for by the people. Now, after the League has been in existence for more than a decade, the United States congress has considered a program to expend seven hundred fifty million dollars to construct a more powerful navy than it has ever before had. It is also spending millions of dollars in the construction of fleets of airships that can engage in a warfare of destruction from the air. The disarmament movement has practically collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other nations both of Europe and of the Orient are constantly increasing the power of their armies, navies and air fleets. Years after the World War ceased and after the formation of the League of Nations the various nations remained armed, despite the haranguing by the politicians. Big Business will not permit disarmament. A leading magazine writer, discussing one of the conferences held at Geneva looking to disarmament and prevention of war, well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ In theory all the delegates were gathered together to carry out the will of their people. But in fact they could do nothing because the big bosses, for their own reasons, as a result of their own bargains, were agreed that nothing should be done. The hope of Europe for disarmament was denied because the protocol was contrary to the material interests of one great power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The preparation for another great war continues and the people suffer under the burden. The con-tinucd preparation for war is a certain indication that the nations expect to indulge in more war. The man who carries a gun is certain to use it upon what he considers a sufficient provocation. Nations are composed of men all of like passions; and when governments are controlled by selfish and ambitious men and these men arm the governments, the arms are put into use whenever the selfish interests think that they arc necessary. The facts show that long after the formation of the League of Nations and the disarmament conferences have been held these conferences have become abortive and the preparation for war goes on. The rulers of the world are in perplexity and in fear of what the future will bring. Some sincere men in public life who would love to see the people in a better condition are at their wits’ end as to what can be done. Expressions by some of these, which will now be quoted, are concurred in by millions of thoughtful persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fred B. Smith, a well-known peace advocate, said: “We are living in a kind of fool’s paradise. Under the slogan of preparedness the militarists everywhere are again precipitating a deluge of war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Frederick J. Libby said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Airplanes, poison gas and hatred mixed together are spelling the doom of civilization. America is preparing for war on a scale so colossal that it has no parallel in the history of the world. Our civilization will perish unless we strive for international peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W. L. Warden, of the London </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail,</span><span class="font4"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The next war will last but a few days; with the air and gas attacks which have been planned by headquarters’ staffs, London and Paris will be wiped out in a night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Viscount Grey said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I think it is certain that if there be another such war civilization will never recover from it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lloyd George said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I am afraid that unless something intervenes there may be in the world again a catastrophe, but not like the last one. The next war may well destroy civilization unless something or somebody does something.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon the earth there are divers and numerous nations, small and great. All of the people of all of these nations are made of one blood. The rights of all should be equal. The privileges enjoyed by the people are unequal in each and every government of earth. If there were a world democracy, and men were perfect, the world would be safe for democracy, and then the privileges of all peoples would be equal. It is well known that they are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why should the people of Germany fight against the people of America? Or the English fight against the French? And why should people of any nation engage in a deadly conflict against the people of another nation? Is there any just cause or excuse for so doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The respective governments of these various nations establish an imaginary line or boundary and endeavor to keep the people of each nation within such boundary. If one journeys from one country to another, he must obtain the consent of the government under which he lives and the approval of the government to which he goes. The government controls the people, and not the people the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a dispute arises between the governing powers or nations, the people or subjects are called upon to bear arms against their fellow man of the other government. Patriotism is invoked to induce the people to fight against each other. Patriotism is wrongfully invoked. Patriotism means love of country and love for the people of that country. Love means an unselfish desire to do good and an effort to put that desire into action. True patriotism therefore should lead the people to endeavor to help each other; and if true patriotism were invoked, there would be no deadly wars between peoples. The peoples being all made of one blood and made to dwell upon the earth, if all were moved by true patriotism they would be unselfishly trying to help each other instead of trying to kill each other. It is the demagogue who waves his arms and appeals to the people to show their patriotism by going to war and slaying each other. As a rule those who make the most noise about patriotism never go to war themselves but slink behind to profit by the spoils at home. When the boys who bear the brunt of the battle return scarred and maimed for life, the profiteers and patriotism-howlers forget these faithful citizens, furnish them with no relief, but permit them to drag out a miserable existence during the remainder of their days. True patriotism should at least provide aid, comfort and support for those who have been incapacitated by reason of the performance of service which they have been compelled to perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every thoughtful person sees that after thousands of years of effort on the part of men to establish ideal governments civilization is now about to collapse. Such is the expressed view of the leading statesmen of the world. The peoples of earth have reached a point of dire extremity. That extremity seems to be necessary to cause the people to carefully and earnestly consider the reason for the unsatisfactory conditions and to seek a true remedy. The present condition of civilization compels all thoughtful persons to agree that there is a great need for a stable and just government of the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A just government is one that is founded in honesty and unselfishly administered in righteousness. The ways of such government must be equal toward all. All honest persons must agree that such a government is of paramount necessity if the peoples of earth are to enjoy peace, prosperity, life, liberty and happiness. In such a government the supreme governing power must center in and be exercised by one who is honest, just and kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the peoples of earth are to receive and enjoy the greatest possible benefits from their government, their minds must find just cause to readily assent to the honesty and righteousness of the governing power exercised over them. When the people see that the governor is righteous and true and is ruling in righteousness, then the inhabitants will learn to do right and to dwell together in peace. It must be conceded by all that the governors of this world have not been satisfactory to man in the past and are not satisfactory at the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purpose here is to prove from indisputable evidence that the supreme governing power exercised over the nations of the world in the past six thousand years has been unrighteous; that the time has come for a great change; and that the beginning of that lime of change is marked by the year 1914; that hereafter the governing power over the peoples of earth shall be exercised by One in whom resides supremacy; and that that governing power shall be exercised in righteousness for the benefit of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some will say that this statement is fantastic because what is, and has been, will ever continue to be. To such the answer is: Up to this time man has failed to establish a righteous government on earth; the governments of the world are now sick unto death; there must be a reason for such condition, and man should attempt to ascertain that reason. It will therefore be worth your while to examine the evidence and then determine whether or not there is hope for a better government for mankind and an early realization of that hope. If there is reason for such hope, then every honest person should desire to know it. The necessity for an honest and righteous government must be conceded by all. There is a certainty of a righteous government's being established on earth, and it is to the interest of each one to calmly and dispassionately examine the evidence bearing thereupon, for his own benefit and for the benefit of his fellow creatures.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>FROM AFIELD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“NOW JEHOVAH GETS ALL PRAISE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in the name of Jehovah and his ever advancing executive officer, our King. You will be pleased to know that the soldiers in this corner of the field are daily going forward under the direction of the Lord; rejoicing as they go, too, for how could we keep from rejoicing in this day of battle. Surely it is a time when “in your patience possess ye your souls’’; yet the Lord is so good to keep us encouraged if we but carry on faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Never was it </span><span class="font3">so hard to place literature, as our last </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin </span><span class="font3">well confirms, yet that does not daunt the zeal and courage of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font3">remnant one whit. In fact, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">rather think the effect is just the opposite all down the line. When you read Isaiah 6 on </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font3">notable day in Cedar Point, neatly ten years ago now, I wondered how we could ever go and ‘make this people dull of hearing’. But now it is easy to see. We have called so many times now, and in the words of Ezekiel the people say, ‘ A very pleasant song,’ but, ‘no, we are not interested’; and as a Greek gentleman said some time ago, “When I see it I believe </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it the </span><span class="font3">more. ’ ’ And that is just the situation, surely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But, regardless of the attitude of the people, it is thrilling to be a member of God’s organization, to be a part of that happy Zion company. And what a flood of truth has been ours! Surely we are not walking in darkness, but “have the light of life”. And it is so logical, as we glance back to see the way things have opened up for our encouragement just at the right time. It most conclusively proves that this whole matter is of Jehovah through his angels in Zion. It often occurs to me that your own heart must rejoice much as you see your faith confirmed after an article has been written on an important Scriptural line and then observe its great result in good for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another great thing we have learned: the greatness, unity and loving spirit that pervades Zion, yet the insignificance and unpraiseworthy position of any man. That surely is wonderful; for now Jehovah gets all praise. Faithful members are much loved; their course of action is an encouragement; but praise belongs to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Never was our company so at peace. The work runs with oiled smoothness. Nearly all grumblers left long ago; a few </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">suckers </span><span class="font3">remain, perhaps, but we are trying to encourage all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“weak </span><span class="font3">hands and feeble knees”. The articles in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Towers </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">studied carefully, and every month the elders meet for a careful study of the late </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Towers.</span><span class="font3"> This is most profitable; the object being to see clearly all points, so that the friends can all be led to see clearly too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Well, it would be easy to write on, telling of the many good things to the praise of Jehovah, but will cloce. With much lose, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">fellow servant in Zion,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LIGHT IN DUE TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today I have the pleasure to send you the Bethel studies report for February (1932) in Helsinki.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During February we have proceeded with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font3"> studies. We have not yet come far in it: only Chapter I has been studied; but all these “preparations” already show that it is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">light</span><span class="font3"> in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How clear it is now that the different ‘churches’ are different features from and after 1879 in the church. W’e can feel and see so well the close relationship between God and the remnant, when noticing how He centuries ago caused to be written those things winch now have been fulfilled before our eyes, and still will be fulfilled on an ever grander scale. We hunger and thirst for the further things revealed us through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The attendance has been as follows: February 2, 13 persons; on the 9th, 12; 16th, 16; and 23d, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wishing you God’s care and help boldly to proclaim the Kingdom message, I remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your little brother in His marvelous service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eero Nironex, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Seo e tai y.</span></p>
