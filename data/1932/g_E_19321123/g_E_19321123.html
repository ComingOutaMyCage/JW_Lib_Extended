<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The World’s Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">L</span><span class="font6">ANGUAGE is a means of communication between intelligent persons or creatures. It is the vehicle of thought or of ideas. It may be either vocal or signified in other ways. Basically, however, language means speech, and has to do with the spoken word and thought rather than the representation of the thought in some other form. When these words and thoughts are represented by marks upon paper, stone or some other medium, we have another form or expression of the language, but the basis of such signs and symbols usually is the spoken word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This thought is conveyed in the word “language” itself, which is derived from the Latin </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">lingua,</span><span class="font6"> meaning the tongue. There are in existence some fairly complete sign languages, consisting of gestures made by means of the hands or otherwise. Among the Indian tribes of America there are a number of vocal languages; but there is but one universal sign language among them, by means of which they can communicate with tribes they would not otherwise understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are three or four thousand languages in the world. One authority indexes 6,760 named tongues and systems of writing. The greatest diversity of languages is found among savage tribes, such as live in Africa, Australia, and the East Indies. There is also a great variety of languages among the American Indians and Eskimos. Among the more civilized peoples languages are more permanent and uniform, being preserved in written records. Large communities bound together in mutual interests preserve the general form of the language through constant intercourse, whereas among the savage tribes isolation of one small group from another tends to create differences and accentuate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Asia there are more than 900 languages, in Europe 600, in Africa 275, and in America 1600, but not all of these languages are printed. In Europe, only 34 languages are printed and officially recognized, the rest being merely dialectal differences or ancient forms of speech preserved by small communities, the members of which are as a rule able to read and speak one of the 34 printed languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The confusion of languages which took place at Babel has continued since, and languages have appeared and disappeared in constant succession. Hence we have with us today the remains of many dead languages which are preserved only in records of stone or parchment or some other medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Goths, the Greeks and the Latins of Europe in the early dawn of history spoke languages no longer used except for cultural and scholastic purposes, and if some early Latin should make his appearance among us today and hear the most fluent speaker of that ancient tongue he would be unable to understand a word. If the same Latin scholar should, however, write down on paper the words he used, the ancient user of that language would stand a better chance of grasping his meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philologists with evolutionistic leanings have tried to demonstrate that originally man had no language other than grunts and growls, and that gradually, after millions of years, he. learned to make distinctions in his grunts and growls, so that a short growl or a high-pitched grunt began to have some particular kind of meaning, and so gradually mankind learned to speak and to talk of the stars and the depths of the sea, of life and of death, of truth and of goodness, and of an infinite number of things of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But this idea is so preposterous that even scientists, who unhappily seem more prone to wild speculation than the ordinary mortal, have largely abandoned the idea. They either give up hope of ever finding out the origin of language and speech or they accept what should have been accepted at the outset, the Bible's assurance that originally God created man endowed with the gift of speech, and that subsequently the confusion of languages took place because mankind turned away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So far from the present-day languages’ having arisen from a lower level, the opposite is found to be the case. The ancient languages, now preserved only in written form, are more complete in their forms than those of modern times. The further back we trace the languages of the race, the more beautifully clear and perfect they are found to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sources of Languages</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The immediate origin of certain languages, such as French, German, Dutch, Spanish, is not hard to trace, but the problem of the relationship of all languages one to another, and their origins and sources, is so complex and involved that scholars are able to arrive at only a very partial conclusion on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is known, for instance, that the languages of Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and some other countries are mainly of Latin origin; and it is also generally conceded that Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and many other European languages, together with some in western Asia, have a common source, Sanskrit being the most ancient of a large family of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the other hand, there are many languages about whose source there is no definite knowledge or even a hypothesis. For the most part philologists have looked for origins in India and western Asia, but much uncertainty still exists even in the minds of scholars as to the exact beginnings of modern languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Constant Change</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whatever may be uncertain in this matter of languages and their relationship one to another, one thing is most definitely established: that there is a constant change going on. As a result, books written a few hundred years ago in the best language of the time, or presumably the best, are today not altogether intelligible, and we have need of glossaries and dictionaries to aid us in understanding just what was meant by the writers. Shakespeare and other authors of his time serve as an example. Most of the editions of Shakespeare issued today have copious footnotes to aid the reader in understanding what he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Changes in language are due first of all to carelessness in the pronunciation of words, so that in time they acquire a decidedly different form. Changes also result from the wrong use of words. This in certain instances has brought about a complete change in meaning. An illustration in point is the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">let,</span><span class="font6"> which at one time meant to hinder, while today it means exactly the opposite, not to hinder. Numerous instances of such changes might be mentioned. They all go to show the tendency of mortal creatures to do things inaccurately, imperfectly, and the result is constant misunderstanding and disagreement. Further, groups of people who at one time had the same language have gradually drifted apart in mutual understanding, and the result has been a number of languages where formerly but one existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such a process of separation we see taking place among the Scandinavian people, with languages so similar that they could easily be combined into one, but where national prejudices are tending toward separation and consequent accentuation of differences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To preserve a language in its original form without change or addition is a practical impossibility, and, it might be said, an undesirable proposition. Where peoples grow and expand in their activities and enlarge their fields of thought and observation, new words and variations of old words are both necessary and desirable. No doubt man has been given the ability to naturally and easily increase the scope of language to meet his growing requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where this is not done the result is a failure to progress. A people may even retrogress, or go backward, and lose much of the scope and depth of their language through failure to maintain the standards and ideals to which they have attained, and their language become proportionately impoverished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philologists say that the language of each people reflects its history, its environment, its development; and this is undoubtedly true. Additionally, the language of a people, the words and forms that predominate in it, reflect the attitude and character of that people. In the Semitic languages the use of the metaphor is common, indicating that these peoples are given to the use of picturesque and figurative language, illustrating their thoughts and ideas most interestingly from nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Indo-European languages, on the other hand, are said to be more philosophic, especially as represented in their higher literature. Unfortunately, however, the Europeans do not seem to have gotten very far with their philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The needs of the people play a large part in determining the form and style of the language used. For common, everyday and practical ends, a common and practical language is developed. People concerned largely with the business of making a living are not particularly concerned with the style and finish of their speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You know what I mean/’ sums up their philosophy of the matter. The fact, nevertheless, remains, that very often others do not know exactly what they mean, and they experience considerable difficulty in making themselves clearly understood in matters that lie outside of the more common phases of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of words at the command of an individual is said to be his vocabulary. The vocabulary of each human creature, in all probability, differs in some degree from that of every other human creature. In a sense, therefore, each man has his own language, and his own way of expressing himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the extent of a man’s vocabulary may not be an index of his intelligence, it is a fair gauge of his mental equipment. One six-year-old boy was found to use more than 2600 words. A Swedish peasant, according to careful investigation, possesses at least ten times that many words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">American college students show an average vocabulary of something less than 60,000. On the other hand, those who cannot boast of an elaborate education need not therefore plead guilty to a limited vocabulary. Many savage tribes make use of a large variety of words, totaling as high as 30,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nations having constant contact with each other inevitably influence each others’ languages. No language is free from foreign elements. As a simple illustration, the names of animals as used by other peoples are adopted by a nation if that animal is not known at home, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">kangaroo, zebra,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">aard-vark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the many languages spoken in the world, it will be possible to consider only the most prominent, and some of the more unique and interesting. The language that has been termed the eldest language of the Indo-Germanic tongues is Sanskrit. The discovery of this language, now no longer spoken, made possible a great advance in knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The similarity of this ancient language to the classical languages, though there is a wide difference in geographic location, made it clear that Latin was not a Greek dialect, but a sister language derived from a common parent. Of the Sanskrit it is said that it is the richest of all languages. Its words are most harmonious in sound and sense and in the way they combine one with another. The beautiful language of Greece pictures but faintly the grandeur of Sanskrit, though related to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Latin, also a member of this language family, is coarser and sterner far, and represents still less of the beauty of the original unknown parent language of which Sanskrit is the elder, and the noblest offspring. No other language is as rich, regular and systematic as the Sanskrit, nor does any other language have an alphabet that so accurately expresses its sounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Closely related to this remarkable language is the language spoken by the Gypsies, the same the world over, though they are scattered among numerous nations. The similarity of the language of the Gypsies to Sanskrit made it certain that their origin was not Egyptian, as had been universally supposed, but that they came originally from India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present languages of Hindustan, approximately thirty all together, are degenerate forms of Sanskrit and have lost much of its beauty. Sanskrit was a spoken language some 1500 years before Christ. It is now preserved only in the Vedas, the sacred books of India.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Indo-Germanic</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Indo-Germanic is the name given to a family of languages which stretches from the south of the Indian peninsula to the most western bounds of Europe. Earlier writings refer to the family as Indo-European, but the objection to this term was that not all European nor all Indian languages are members of this family, and that some languages found neither in Europe nor in India are members of it. Consequently the term Indo-Germanic has been selected as denoting the terminal links in the chain, without attempting to define or suggest its geographical extent. Turkish, Hungarian, Basque, Lapp and Finnish are not members of the Indo-Germanic family of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Indo-Germanic languages have spread over the vast territory stretching from the mouth of the Ganges to the British Isles and Scandinavia, and thence to the Americas. They comprise the Sanskrit, Zend, Old Persian, Greek, Latin, Lettie, Slavonic, German and Keltic families of tongues, all having remarkable resemblances and similarities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One writer says, “There is indeed a wonderfully scientific and artistic unity of plan in the structure of the Indo-European type of languages, as also in that of the Semitic: and the argument is conclusive from the unity of analogies here, as in nature, to unity of authorship, and that authorship divine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indo-Germanic languages are distinguished by the inflectional changes in the form of the root words, as illustrated in the following example: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beauty,</span><span class="font6"> the noun; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beautiful,</span><span class="font6"> the adjective; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beautifully,</span><span class="font6"> the adverb; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beautify,</span><span class="font6"> the verb, present tense; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beautified,</span><span class="font6"> the past tense of the verb; and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is difficult for some of us to imagine a language in which there are no such variations of form and where each word has its own unalterable form, unrelated in form or structure to other words of similar or allied meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet there are such languages, as, for instance, the Chinese, in which each word has but one syllable, and stands by itself, having no related words of similar but modified form. In Chinese a change in thought or tense is indicated by a change in the arrangement of the words or a change in the pitch in which a word is spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Indo-Germanic languages also have suffixes and prefixes which modify the meaning of words, but no such arrangement is observed in Chinese, where modification of meaning must be expressed by the use of additional words or entirely different words. These suffixes and prefixes, while they may be added to a large variety of words, have no meaning when standing by themselves. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Pre</span><span class="font6"> itself is an example, as in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">prevent, preserve, present</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">preside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this respect the Indo-Germanic languages differ from languages that are called “agglutinative”, of which Turkish is an example, in which words are linked together, sometimes in a long string, to form other words of different or extended meaning, an arrangement which is met with in English to some extent, as in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">manfully, carelessness.</span><span class="font6"> In Chinese, however, even this simple method of word formation is not employed. Each syllable stands separate and distinct and makes no connection with other syllables, but expresses a complete, fixed, unvarying idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting, too, to note that in the Indo-Germanic languages compound words are frequently met with, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">schoolhouse, upstairs </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cornerstone,</span><span class="font6"> a peculiarity which is not found in languages outside of this group. There is in some of them but little distinction between the verb and the noun, and others have lost or are losing their inflection, and are beginning to resemble Chinese in that the meaning of a word must frequently be determined by the context. An example of this in English would be the word “bear”, which when pronounced does not show whether a verb or a noun or an adjective (bare) is meant, unless circumstance or context makes the meaning clear.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Greek</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">In the front rank of the Indo-Germanic languages is Greek, which has made its influence, widely felt and which has spread far beyond the narrow confines of the little country that saw its origin. The domain of this language increased as the military power of Greece conquered the world, and it became coextensive with the colonies of that busy people. The pronunciation of Modern Greek is entirely different from the ancient language, so that the writer of the ancient classics would be unable to understand the modern Greek though he would probably have little difficulty in reading his newspaper. Greek has been used continuously for 2700 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The claim is often made that Greek is the most nearly perfect of languages. Some students aver that classic Greek even surpassed the Sanskrit in the variety and exactness of its forms and in phonetic beauty. The Greek in which the originals of the New Testament were written was the language spoken by the common people, rather than that used by the learned.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Latin</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It was at one time believed that Latin was a dialect of Greek, but subsequent studies have made it certain that this is not the case. It is a sister language, having a common parentage with Greek and with the older Sanskrit. Although in respect to time Latin historically comes after Greek, yet it has exercised a wider influence in the dominant nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The triumph of Rome over the nations of the world was naturally followed by the expansion of Roman influence, literature and language. It spread over France and the Spanish peninsula, over vast stretches of what is now Germany, and further to the English isles and the Scandinavian peninsula in the far north, sweeping everything before it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As preserved today in numerous books and records, Latin represents the speech, not of the common people of the Augustan age, but of the elite and the learned. The characteristics of Latin are gravity, strength and energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be said that Latin, which was the dominant language of the world for so long a time, is still the most influential of languages. When it is recognized that the languages of Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and some other countries are derived directly from the Latin, and that English has a large percentage of Latin in its vocabulary, it will be seen how widely diffused is this ancient tongue as represented in its modern dialects, which have gained the status of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Spanish is spoken in all of South America and Central America; English is the language of all of North America, of Australia, of portions of Africa, and the official language of India, and is now becoming the secondary language of many countries the world over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Latin, too, is preserved in the law books of England and America, which are replete with Latin formulas. Doctors and pharmacists the world over use Latin in their business, whether for good or ill; botanists and students of every shade and hue find some use for the old Latin language, and the books of writers of note until modern times were all written in Latin, and can be fully appreciated by those only who can read them in their original form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Europe Latin is far more common than in America, and it is easily acquired by students of nations who trace the descent of their language to the Latin. Latin has been proposed as the official secondary language of the world, but in the minds of many persons there must be an involuntary distaste for a language which has been the instrument of one of the most predacious of nations and the most predacious of churches.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Italian is the modern form of the ancient Latin, its most direct descendant. It is spoken by approximately 45,000,000 people. Its use in matters musical is a matter of common knowledge. The Italians are as proud of their language as most other people are of theirs, although why anyone should be proud of the particular language he has happened to fall heir to is rather difficult to determine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All languages today are certainly corruptions of more ancient forms, and even these, it would be well to remember, are in their diversity marks of divine displeasure, Jehovah’s judgment upon the ambitious scheme of haughty men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Italy a vigorous campaign is being carried on to purge the Italian language of all foreign words. There is a tax levied on all hotels, shops, stores, etc., which display signs written in any language other than Italian. The papers propose to banish foreign words altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Spanish is widely diffused, being spoken in large stretches of territory in the Western Hemisphere. More than 55,000,000 people use the Spanish tongue. Of all living languages Spanish is said to be the most majestic in sound and movement. Portuguese, closely related to Spanish, is spoken by 30,000,000 people. Some say it is even more beautiful and musical than Spanish. Brazil is the only South American country which does not speak the Spanish language. Portuguese is the language there used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">French is spoken by 60,000,000 people, and after a fashion by a good many more. French is one of the official languages of Switzerland, which, having no language of its own, makes use of German, Italian and French. French is also the official language of Belgium, which was at one time half Dutch and half French, but where the Dutch language is being crowded out by the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">French may be called the 'polite’ language. It is considered beautiful and precise. Some of the most beautiful passages in all literature have been written in French, and undoubtedly some of the most ugly. French is a pleasing reproduction of the old Latin. It has a smaller mixture of other elements than the Spanish, and more than the Italian. There are something like four hundred and fifty root words, with many derivatives and compound words, of direct German origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">French has modified English to some extent, by its effect upon the Latin elements in that language and by direct introduction into it of many French words. On the other hand, French is making use of many English terms, and is gradually absorbing them into the language, sometimes with laughable modification of sound, as in “kneekerbookers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War and the popularity of Lindbergh have both contributed to the addition of English words to the French language. The Acadians in the Evangeline countryside spoke the French language almost exclusively until very recent time, hut it is now being replaced by the use of English, the language of the rest of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In France, as in many other countries, there is a wide gulf between the speech of the educated classes and that of the rest of the population. In fact, the disparity is said to be so pronounced as to constitute them almost different languages. A university teacher of France recently listening to a group of Parisian workmen (not foreign) could not understand them!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>German, Russian, Slav, and Others</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Most noted of the Germanic tongues, aside from English, is German. Before the war it was considered a comparative necessity to the educated man to have a knowledge of German. It was and is important culturally and commercially. It is the language in which the discoveries and guesses of some of the world’s most noted scientists, philosophers and thinkers are recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsch,</span><span class="font6"> the name by which the Germans call themselves, allied to the name “Teutons”, is derived from the Gothic </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">thiuda,</span><span class="font6"> meaning “nation”. It is similar to the word “Gentile”. The present form of the High German became fixed when Luther employed it in his translation of the Bible, which is still recognized as the standard version in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">German is spoken by approximately 90,000,000 people, and understood by perhaps 20,000,000 more. It is not as widely studied as before the war. In England this is notably the case. It was found that British students, in choosing the language they would study, preferred French to German by 13 to 1. In Poland students forced a restaurant owner to change his German sign to Polish, by filling his restaurant and ordering nothing but water. When the sign was finally changed they all came and ordered big dinners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other Teutonic languages are Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Finnish. Dutch is spoken in the Netherlands and the northern part of Belgium. In the latter country it is called Flemish, but it differs little from Holland Dutch. The proper name is Netherlands, and not Dutch, the latter name being a corruption of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsch,</span><span class="font6"> which means German. The language of the Netherlands is very similar to the German, and inhabitants of either country can learn the language of the other with comparatively little effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Boers in South Africa also speak Dutch, but, they being separated from their native land by so great a distance, differences have developed which have constituted South African Dutch practically a separate language. Additionally, Dutch is spoken in Dutch Guiana, and it is also the official language of the Dutch East Indies. It is estimated that some 15,000,000 people speak the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish are much alike, and it would seem that these countries would be mutually benefited by striving for uniformity rather than stressing minor differences. These languages are descended from the Urnordisk. Iceland is striving to keep alive the Old Norse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kindred to Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse is the Friesic or Frisian language once spoken generally on the Elbe, along the northern shore of Germany and of the Netherlands and in southern Denmark. All together there are now about 30,000 or 40,000 people who speak this interesting dialect, in which are found many similarities to English. An energetic society of scholars has held periodical congresses and otherwise encouraged the study and use of the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lithuanian, of all the living languages most antique in its forms, is of great value to the etymologist. It resembles the Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, and serves as an interpreter of many words in other languages whose relationship to the history of language would not otherwise be understood. On the shores of the Baltic sea the Lithuanians, like the Icelanders, have been outside of the path of emigration, and thus their language has suffered little change and preserves remarkably its original character.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Slavonic Languages</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">This group of languages comprises the Serbs and Croats, the Slovenians or Jugo-Slavs, the Bulgarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Serbo-Lusatians, Poles and Russians. Russian, originally an Indo-Germanic language, has a large vocabulary not derived from the Indo-Germanic source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Slavonic languages cover a large portion of Europe and Asia and spread even into North America. The Russian is the most extensive of the Slavonic languages, and is with the Servian the most harmonious of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While these languages agree remarkably with Greek, the resemblance of the Russian to the Latin is very noticeable. All of them have, in fact, a considerable element of Latin in them, though for the most part they make use of Greek characters in writing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is considerable similarity between Russian and Polish, so much that each can read the other’s language with a little effort. The Russian, too, can quite easily comprehend the ancient Bulgarian. There are 37 letters in the Russian alphabet, but two of them are not often used. The Bolshevik minister having abolished the use of the useless hard sign and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">y, </span><span class="font6">the Russian is now considered the best phonetic language of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Russians are, as a rule, the best natural linguists, their language having, it is said, the splendor of the Spanish, the vivacity of French, the strength of German, the tenderness of Italian, and the richness and powerful conciseness of Greek and Latin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Russians, having a real admiration for American efficiency, though not for American political institutions, have coined some interesting words for everyday use, among them </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fordizat-zia,</span><span class="font6"> which might by us be rendered “Fordiza-tion”. It signifies efficiency, standardization of labor, mass production. They also have </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ameri-kanizatzia,</span><span class="font6"> which you can figure out for yourself, as well as “shtorm”, “briz,” “visky,” “bif-steks,” “rostbif” and “puding”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A campaign has been launched in Russia which may result in a great influx of schoolboys to that “happy” land. This campaign favors the scrapping of all grammatical rules. Just how Russia hopes to have a uniform language in all parts of its wide domain without some grammatical standards is not quite clear. A practical argument in favor of the proposition is that it would result in a saving of $10,000,000 a year, which is something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Servian, Croatian and Slovenian languages are included under the general title of Servian or Illyrian. One writer remarks, “When written in the Cyrillic character, as by those of the Greek church, it is called Servian; but when written in the Latin alphabet, as by the Roman Catholics, it is called Illyrian: so much do men like names and fight for mere words.” The Servians break down old words quite readily and reduce them to the pleasantest and easiest forms, so that the language is rich in vowels and very musical to the ear.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Here and There</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Now as to other parts of the globe. The multiplicity of languages makes it impossible to mention even all the more important. But looking here and there we find a few more items of general interest. As already mentioned, there is a great variety of languages in the Americas. These are the languages of the original Americans, not of those who moved here from Europe. The Indian languages are many and varied and entirely divergent one from another, though they may be classified under one head, and be called a family of languages, because they show a general relationship. The main divisions of these many languages amount to 51 in South America and 56 in North America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are three main divisions of the Semitic family of languages. They are the Hebrew, the Aramean and the Arabic. Hebrew is the language of the Jews, being used by them from the days of Moses until the time of Nehemiah, after which it experienced many modifications and changes. Hebrew is now being revived in its purity, being used and taught in Palestine as the accepted language of the Jews who have returned there. It is the language in which the Old Testament scriptures were originally written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An attempt is being made in Jerusalem to modernize Hebrew by the printing of a Hebrew supplement in Latin characters in an English weekly paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arabic is a language of considerable importance and wide influence. The Koran and the religion of Mohammed, which enlisted the aid of the sword in making converts, made Arabic one of the world’s great languages. It is rich in words and grammatical forms and is said to be adapted for business as well as for society and abstract subjects; A number of dialects have developed from the original Arabic, which, however, do not differ more from the original than French and Roumanian do from the Latin. In writing Arabic, vowels are not represented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a close relationship between Aramean and Hebrew. Kemuel, a nephew of Abraham, is called the father of Aram, in Genesis 22: 21, and Jacob is referred to as an Aramean, in Deuteronomy 26: 5 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(R.V.,</span><span class="font6"> margin). Syriac is one of its chief dialects. It is probable that the native tongue of Jesus was the Galilean dialect of Aramaic (Aramean), widely used in Palestine in His day.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Other Language Groups</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">There are still other families or groups of languages, all having subdivisions. These groups are Hamitic, Chinese, Turanian, Mongolian, Central African, South African, and others. In the African Sudan there is a perfect babel of languages. There are no books of any kind, and no teachers. The intonations of each word determine the meaning, and a wrong intonation often completely changes the sense. In one of the tribes seven different tones are used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that the Hausa Negroes of the Sudan, a highly developed people, speak “the most beautiful language in the world”. However, as this claim has been made for other languages as well, we shall have to take this statement with a grain of salt. Their language is very euphonious and represents in reality a mixture of many tongues, which has been compared to a mosaic of varicolored stones. The beautiful and singular sounds of the Hausa tongue are used by 20,000,000 Africans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chinese, as previously mentioned in this article, is one of the most unique and singular of languages. It is in a class by itself. Every word has just one syllable, and is represented by a distinct and separate sign and not by a group of signs or letters with phonetic values. While each sign represents a word, the pitch in which it is spoken determines its exact meaning when spoken. Thus various characters may represent a word pronounced in the same way, but at a different pitch to denote the meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is claimed that Chinese is the oldest of writing systems, and while adequate for the early history of the people, it has limited the growth of the spoken language. The Chinese have, however, managed to collect a vocabulary of 80,000 words, although many of these are now obsolete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While they have a common written language, there is no standard spoken tongue, as the 400,000,000 subjects of the vast empire use a large number of variations in sound and arrangement of the written language. Thus educated Chinamen from different parts of the country can converse with each other, as a rule, only by means of pencil and paper, or by writing in the sand with a stick. They would never understand each other otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chinese has no alphabet, of course, though an effort is made now to represent the language in a modern way, both by selecting a number of characters from the thousands of Chinese word symbols and by using the Roman alphabet for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Japan a language is spoken which some students say resembles the Hebrew rather than the Chinese, though the resemblance, we may be sure, is not very great. The system of writing used by the Japanese represents, not the idea or the word, as in Chinese, nor the sound, as in European languages, but the syllables. Thus a number of signs may be required to denote a word, and the same signs appear in different arrangements to express a different thought or represent a different word. The Japanese have many Chinese words in their language, and the Chinese in turn have borrowed from the Japanese, absorbing such borrowed words into their own language and thereby enriching it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Koreans speak a language which resembles Japanese and which also has many words borrowed from the Chinese. They have an alphabet, the letters or characters representing the sounds and not the words or syllables. There is a plan under way among educators to reform the systems of writing of China, Japan and Korea so as to make them uniform, which would simplify the task of learning the languages and be an advantage in other respects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In our survey of languages we have reserved English until the last. Though a language belonging to the Indo-Germanic group, English is a polyglot language containing elements and words from numerous other languages. In its composition there is much Latin and Greek, German, French, Scandinavian and Spanish, as well as borrowings from the most diversified list of languages. The percentage of foreign words has been variously estimated, the Latin element absorbed into the language, directly or indirectly, being placed as high as over sixty percent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Basically, however, the English language is Anglo-Saxon, a Germanic combination. The original Britons were Celts, who were attacked by the Saxons or Teutons from the fifth to the eighth century, and these Saxons were afterward vanquished by the Normans. Each of these events left its imprint upon the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Celtic people led the way of emigration through the wildernesses of early Europe and inhabited the greater part of it in early historic times. They were found by races that followed them, and either driven back or absorbed. Their last footing was in the British Isles, and Celtic is now the most westerly representative of the Indo-Germanic family of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Irish is the most important of the Celtic languages, which are spoken by approximately 3,500,000 persons. Scottish-Gaelic, Welsh and Breton are dialects of Celtic. There are many remnants of Celtic in modern English. The language is in several respects like the Old Egyptian, which is of the Hamitic family, but Celtic is of Indo-Germanic origin. This resemblance points to a common source of which we have no historical knowledge outside of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Old Saxon, another progenitor of English, was formerly spoken in the north of Germany. If William the Conqueror had never crossed the English Channel the speech of England might have been a mixture of Scandinavian and German. But for 300 years after his advent the language of the court and the nobility was French, and the result was a merging of the French and Anglo-Saxon, and a great many of the words in English today trace their history back to the time of the Norman conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As German is a language which throughout has fewer admixtures of other languages in it than any other European tongue, so English has more than any other. Europe is composed of two language groups, the Romanic and the Teutonic, and these two divisions are remarkably combined in the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though it is more difficult to master than other modern languages, it has numerous advantages, one of them being its wide scope. As may be expected, there are many dialects of the English, and the differences between these are particularly marked in England. There are also variations in America, where the speech of the South differs considerably from that of the North, though not to a degree that prevents mutual understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other sections of the vast reaches of the United States also have their local peculiarities, but the effect of the radio, the automobile, the bus and other means of transportation is gradually toning down these differences in both England and America, and the constant intercourse between all parts of the English-speaking world promises to contribute to the attainment of a uniform pronunciation. Another factor in this leveling-up process is the motion picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The written language is the same in all the English-speaking nations, and the spoken language is more nearly uniform than that of any other widely diffused language. Tn the case of Spanish, for instance, it is contended that the various nations of South America, though all speaking Spanish, often find it difficult to understand one another; and the 400,000,000 Chinese cannot in any proper sense be said to have a common language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">America has made its contributions to the English language, and while its innovations are not always immediately welcomed in England, yet gradually Americanisms find their way into English in other lands, probably as a result of the distribution of American books, periodicals and motion pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One admirable quality of the English language is its directness and brevity. Take, for instance, the headline, “Jap King Takes Crown.” A Finnish reader would make use of the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">valtaistiiimelleiisettamisjubla,</span><span class="font6"> which means only “coronation ceremony”, and which still would not indicate where and to whom it happened. Other languages have similarly cumbrous expressions, which would cause one to doubt the supposed difficulty of learning English, especially for people who have mastered languages so involved and formidable as some other European languages appear to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One advantage which English has over the majority of European tongues is that its adjectives and articles have no gender, number, person nor case. What a convenience this is is realized only by one who attempts to learn a foreign language where he finds that he is powerless to use a noun until he knows the gender and determines what particular one of the varying forms of adjectives or articles may be used with the noun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The best examples of pure English are the Bible and the works of Shakespeare. The latter, however, have a larger number of obsolete and archaic expressions, while the Revised Version of the Bible brings that wonderful book into closer harmony with modern English and still preserves the admirable simplicity and beauty of the earlier King James Version. In England and America, as in other lands, the translation of the Bible and the works of prominent writers have served to preserve the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">American talking pictures are having their effect upon people of other than English-speaking countries. Tn Scandinavia, where English is taught in the schools, there is amazing interest in American talkies. In the movie houses people are most attentive in their effort to understand and to brush up their pronunciation of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">French is giving way to English as the official language of the diplomats in Washington. This is due partly to the increased importance of Washington in international affairs and partly to the fact that few American politicians speak any foreign language sufficiently well to understand the themes likely to be discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">English, too, is becoming the language of the Philippines, supplanting Spanish as the common language. The adults as well as the children are eager to learn English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An interesting experiment in Stockholm showed that while few people were acquainted with French, German, Italian, Russian and the artificial languages of Esperanto and Ido, there were many who had some understanding of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In French schools English is superseding German, while in many other countries it is being taught as a secondary language.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Universal Language</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">English comes nearer to being a “universal” language than any of the other languages of the world. In geographical extent it is unrivaled. Efforts have been put forth to create an artificial universal or international language. These efforts have met with indifferent success, though much attention has been given to make such artificial languages both simple and uniform in construction, spelling and pronunciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet so attractive has been the appeal of a universal language that from the 17th century to the present more than 800 have been formulated. Chief among these are Volapuk, Esperanto, Spelin, Mondoligue, Universala, Kosmos, Novilatin, Idiom Neutral, Ido and Ro. Volapuk was received with much enthusiasm, but this did not continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Esperanto has many enthusiastic supporters. It has made considerable progress as an international language. The simplicity of Esperanto grammar is remarkable, having sixteen fundamental rules with no exceptions. It is easy to learn, even without the aid of a teacher, a proper textbook being sufficient for the average student. In Russia 170 newspapers use Esperanto, and in Japan a newspaper with a circulation of hundreds of thousands is reported to have an Esperanto column twice a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nearly a hundred periodicals are working together to advance the Esperanto cause. In scores of European cities there are Esperanto policemen assigned to be of service to travelers. At Esperanto gatherings it is impossible to tell the nationality of the individuals when speaking Esperanto, so much alike is the pronunciation of it by Italians and Norwegians, Russians and Englishmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An Esperanto edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> appears twice yearly. Though it is the most widely used artificial language, Esperanto can boast of no more than 5,000,000 who speak it, and that figure is probably exaggerated. This is the result of forty years of effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During that same period of time English has gained 100,000,000 adherents, making a total of about 300,000,000 souls who can speak that language to some extent. English has thus far the advantage over other languages. In this language, too, the Bible has had its widest distribution, and the Kingdom message now going forth to all nations has had a larger circulation in English than in other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To aid still others in gaining a knowledge of English a system has been devised which will enable a person to readily learn the basic parts of the language. The system is called ‘basic English’. Its originator estimates that 500,000,000 have some knowledge of English and that the number is increasing. It is his claim that in English only is it possible to make a basic word list covering the essentials of everyday talk short enough to make it attractive to the average person, who, as a rule, is not too studious. The list contains only 850 simple words. But the ultimate world-language will probably be something different from anything that is in existence today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ideal of a common language for the 2,000,000,000 inhabitants of the world is a pleasing one. No doubt the time will come when all nations and kindreds will again be of one language and one speech, for the power of the Christ of God, already operative in the earth, will ultimately draw the whole world into one vast brotherhood composed of all the well-disposed, while the evildoer shall be cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On account of the continuity of the history of Abraham back to Adam as recorded in the Scriptures it is inferred that the original language of man was Hebraic or Semitic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We get some faint idea of the powers of the angels and other spirit creatures when we reflect that they are familiar with all of the languages spoken today as well as hundreds or thousands of tongues once spoken but no longer in use.</span></p>

Mr. Glassford is too much of a stickler for the whole truth, and for justice. He should have kept still until after election.

<h3><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>Hardships Amongst Coal Miners </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">MINOUS clouds are hanging over the coal fields of the middle west. It is alleged by the miners that their international president, John L. Lewis, and the Illinois state president, John H. Walker, no longer represent them; that these men are fraternizing with the coal industry, and not laboring in the interest of the miner. And now the miners have revolted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">James Cross, one of the leaders in the revolt, is reported to have made some very pungent statements as to the trouble, which we may sum up as follows: The miners were getting a wage scale of $6.10 a day, but there were so many idle days that the miners were not receiving an average of $50 a month, and when the question of a five-dollar basic day came up it was promptly voted down; it was overwhelmingly voted down the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following this a fake “holdup” was staged in ■which the ballots were stolen, so that a recount was impossible. It is explained that the ballots could not have been stolen, for the ballots are counted, sealed and locked up in each local union. The tabulation sheets only are sent to headquarters. If the tabulation sheets are stolen it is an easy matter to get a recount without any publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But this was a coup of Lewis and Walker, and under the existing “emergency”, so called, the new five-dollar wage scale was declared in effect. The miners refused to have this jammed down their throats, and the rebellion has reached out to the recall of these two presidents, one state and the other international. On account of the rank betrayal by these two presidents the miners have decided to make a stand for the reinstatement of the old scale, and it is intimated that resorting to firearms is not at all unlikely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is alleged that the coal operators are up to one of their timeworn tricks to intimidate the miners, that of bringing in gunmen and gangsters to kill them off, if necessary. And, as always, we may expect the “arm” of the law to aid the operators. Out of 40,000 miners in Illinois less than 5,000 are working, and most of these under compulsion, for hundreds of miners in Franklin county have asked their brother miners to rescue them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is emphasized that the miners would not object to a five-dollar basic day if they could have at least enough workdays to earn enough to live in common respectability, but they do object to any cut when they are at the mercy of the operators as to the number of days they are privileged to work; so, it is said, there is no possibility of a truce. The miners of Kentucky, Indiana and Iowa are joining forces with the Illinois miners and a united convention has already been planned; and when these miners come together, it is claimed, they will go armed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Very many of these miners are claimed to belong to the Ku Klux Klan, and therefore it is reported that Ku Klux Klan tactics will be used in carrying out their purposes to cripple and destroy the coal industry. But this claimed Ku Klux membership may be a hoax to stir up prejudice against the miners and solicit the sympathy of the public for the operators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Blood has already been spilled, and the miners are stirred up, and with what to them is righteous indignation they will fight with determination to accomplish three things: (a) The defeat of wage reduction; (b) the ousting of both Lewis and Walker from their official positions in the United Mine Workers of America; (c) the liberating of the miners in Franklin county who are being forced to work against their wills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Airplanes are flying over Franklin county dumping printed appeals to the miners. Even women’s auxiliaries are holding meetings and planning boycotts against merchants who are not in sympathy with the miners’ cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The above is another travesty on our presentday civilization. Strikes have been before. But strikes before were for living wages. This strike is different: this is for a chance to work to keep out of the bread lines; and the coal operators do not seem to be meeting the situation wisely; nor can they!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">One hundred and eighteen officials receive more than $4,800 a year. Ten are paid $12,000 a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">KEY MEN GET </span><span class="font4">$500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ten are six aides to the directors here, three members of the New York agency staff, and the Chicago branch manager. Their salaries exceed those of the directors, who receive $10,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Washington staff of more than 70 “key men” getting more than $400 monthly costs the corporation roughly $500,000 a year. This is in addition to several hundred stenographers, doormen and messengers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Salaries of the agency managers range from $450 a month at Portland, Oreg., to $1,250 at New York. The assistant manager and credit department chief in New York are listed at $12,000 a year. The Chicago agency head gets $1,041.67 a month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A friend in Kalamazoo sent us the foregoing clipping, commenting on it interestingly and forcefully as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a member of the United Press, the Kalamazoo </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font4"> thought best to make mention of the R.F.C. activities in salary fixing of its directors, etc. Just why it was in Part 2 of this issue or why it was tucked away among a lot of glaring advertisements on page 24, was not stated. Nor did it state why the directors were unhampered by Civil Service Rules in the fixing of the salaries mentioned. Nothing was said to enlighten our feeble minds as to what is meant by “key men”. Evidently they are in control of “something”, judging from the amount of salary they receive, $400.00 per month! Gee! that’s more than the average man makes in a year nowadays. Wonder how much the messengers, “doormen,” and stenographers get; and why are </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font4"> needed? But the most mystifying is why it costs more to maintain an “agency manager” (?) in one section of the country than in another. Gosh! doesn’t it cost a lot to tell the B. &amp;&nbsp;0. Railroad that it can have $32,500,000 of “relief”, with an option on $31,625,000 more? Why should borrowing money be so expensive? Perhaps </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font4">might be a medium of enlightenment on some of these perplexing questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had just gotten so we liked this Kalamazoo man, in spite of the hard name of the town -where he lives, and expected, of course, he would sign his name, but he just wound up by signing himself “A Millennarian”, and now we more than half think he wrote that skit just to see if he couldn’t get us to say something mean and get us into trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But nobody can get us to say anything mean about that bunch down at Washington. After ■what the Prophet Isaiah has intimated as to the canine ancestry of the clergy, in Isaiah 56:10, 11, far be it from us to say anything reflecting on the politicians or those other high-minded principal of the flock, who look after our finances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are not going to say anything at all, but if we were going to say anything, all we would say would be that this time they not only are cleaning the safe, but are carefully removing all the inside fittings, including anything that they think could be hocked at the junk yard. When they get through, Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard, in its worst day of desolation, will look like a warehouse full of ham and eggs compared to what they will leave for the comfort of the ex-soldiers, the common people or anybody at all but themselves. And if you kick, beware of the “Hero of Anacostia”, the machine guns and the poison gas, tear bombs and cavalry.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>Insure Your Soul for Two Bits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE times are hard, and it seems now that you can get your soul insured for twenty-five cents. This is a cut price now offered by Rev. F. J. Huber, 552 Protectory Place, Pittsburgh, Pa. Mr. Huber, in his little folder “The Greatest Value Ever Received for Twenty-five Cents”, under the heading “Spiritual Insurance”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Safeguard your soul as you would your life and business. We insure our lives against death, our bodies against sickness and accident, our business against loss, our buildings against fire and storm, yet we often neglect to insure our most precious possession, our immortal soul, against spiritual mishap and subsequent eternal loss. Our Association presents a Spiritual Insurance Policy which you cannot afford to overlook. Enrollment in our Patron’s Membership will procure for you yearly the immeasurable spiritual benefits of a thousand masses, five novenas of masses and the daily prayers of our boys for 25 years. This period may be doubled, trebled, or increased as you choose. An offering of 25 cents will entitle one person to these same benefits of the Association for one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only thing clear about this is that if you send in 25 cents you are minus a quarter. The advantages received are the same as came to Gen. Nobile’s airship, just before it broke in two. That was not much, to be sure, but a man who would insure his soul for only a quarter could not expect very much. Now could he? But maybe Reverend Huber will take more than a quarter, if you urge him. We are not certain on that point. But we seem to think that he would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Boom of Schwanenkirchen </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Hugo R. Pack (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Miracle or Economic Law?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE German and also the American press reported some time ago an amazing occurrence. In a country economically depressed, a distress which has hardly its equal in other nations, particularly in the lower classes; in a country that, on account of its extremely precarious financial position, succeeded in getting the united support of her former war enemies; in the midst of a nation-wide misery with almost 5 million, i. e., 25 percent of its population, out of employment and many of the rest working short hours, something happened in the economic and financial field for which the experts of economic science prefer to wrap themselves in deep silence and for which the rest of the world, including the Press, with the exception of the so-called ‘Physiocrats’, or adherents of the new economic school of Free-Economy, unable to explain the thing, have found mental satisfaction in referring to it as a “miracle”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Out of an ocean of economic stagnation, failures, bankruptcies, an island of economic boom has risen. The particular region which fate selected for the demonstration of this “miracle” amazes the world still more. Down in the economically and culturally dark Bavarian forests, where the people never had very much of modern civilization, similar to certain districts of our western regions; down in those wooded hills and mountains where German fairy tales “of the seven dwarfs beyond the seven hills with Snowwhite” happen but where the reality of life for man is so much harder and more toilsome than elsewhere, because ‘some old witch had apparently thrown a bad spell with her magic wand’, is the place of our “miraculous” happenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is, unlike in all other regions of cultural Germany, no electric light and no sewerage installed in the Bavarian villages. Children are forced to walk on bad, muddy roads in heavy wooden shoes, for long hours, to the rare and distant little schools with one teacher and eight grades, as in Georgia. In this “German Siberia”, as they call it, a very remarkable economic experiment has been made that should make the world look upward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a coal mine in the district, but it had, like the quarries, closed down. In the forests reigned deadly quietness, where formerly the ringing sound of the axe and saw told the tale of building homes. The tradesmen idle like the rest, the peasant destitute, and the business men waiting in vain for their customers, all economic life seemed to have passed away. One stands dumfounded in view of these desolate conditions of human poverty and misery which words are inadequate to describe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Five years ago the mine of Schwanenkirchen had closed after it had passed through various hands, with always the same result, of bankruptcy. When the depression became more intense, the mine became one of its first victims. All efforts to revive it, by changing owners, were unsuccessful. Finally, the managing engineer bought it for all he had saved, but only to keep it closed, as he could not find anybody to invest the necessary amount to exploit it even on a small scale, so that some of the people, most in need, might make a poor living. Thus, for five years the water had been rising in the shafts the miners, together with many other people that directly or indirectly were benefited by the working of the mine, were marching every week or month to the city hall to get their unemployment dole, enough for a bare existence, but hardly enough to live. The shops were void of customers, not even “wieners” were asked for at the butcher’s, the people went in worn-out clothes and shoes, leaving the tailor and shoemaker with a worrying wife and hungry children, and in the restaurants were flies by the thousands taking the place of the guests. Such were the conditions up to 1930, when the “miracle” gradually began to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the very moment when the night of depression began to darken and to stretch out all over the civilized world, when the statesmen of all nations put their heads together in order to devise some plan of relief for unemployment and human misery, when the politicians began to make big speeches, to talk of too much wheat for bread, too much cotton and wool for clothing, too much wealth, too much of everything; when the storerooms were not emptying as usual, but rather began to pile up; while the destitute masses could not buy the very things they saw in such abundance, then the “miracle” began to occur at Schwanenkirchen and vicinity, in the Bavarian forest. The machine at the mine began to pump the water from the shafts, workers in rubber suits went down to repair them, the mining tower, having burnt down in the meantime as though fate desired to establish a definite and permanent line through the past of human action and glory, was rebuilt. The mining transports began hurrying down to the station and emptying their natural wealth into the railroad cars. The dole office got rid of its permanent customers. The restaurants began to enjoy human customers again, and the guests to enjoy the bountiful store of Bavarian beer and something special to eat; the butchers had demand for “wieners” and meat in quantities unknown heretofore, which before had been a rare treat with these poor people; the tobacco stores frequently heard the ring of the doorbell, the hardware dealer’s sales rose to amounts which he had no memory of ever having had before, suits and shoes were sold, and the whole region became filled with the joy of life, where formerly misery and poverty reigned supreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What had happened? Did a millionaire, not knowing what to do with his money, bring about the change? Or did an American loan produce the “miracle” ? People of this region would hardly know what this meant. And yet, something did happen, some mysterious power had accomplished all this unbelievable, unheard-of change. Did the old witch remove the spell from the region? How did it happen that the unemployed of this desolate region found work and bread when millions and millions elsewhere were suffering from starvation? The German press began to talk about the very strange happenings. Reporters were sent and told the amazing story to the world, until, perhaps, some secret understanding made them hush. Today the regional boom continues although it seems to go very much against certain interests, because the press has become silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These are the facts: Unable to find a capitalist to put up the necessary amount of money for working capital, Mr. Hebecker, the mine owner and engineer, got in touch with the so-called “Waera” Exchange Association, which is putting into practice, in a limited manner, the principles which the newly evolved economic school of Free-Economy advocates; namely, the issue of a medium of exchange, taking the place of money, standing under compulsory circulation and which can no more be withheld or hoarded, or go on a strike and thus interrupt the exchange of goods and services and of production, and in this way create unemployment, poverty, misery; and furthermore, the adaptation of the amount of such circulating money to the requirements of the market, in order to maintain the economic equilibrium, as indicated by the index, the general price level. Mr. Hebecker asked the “Waera” Exchange Association, which issues to its members such a medium of exchange, called “Waera” and which they now have circulating in hundreds of German towns and cities, for a loan of 50,000 units. One Waera equals 1 Reichsmark. One day he called his unemployed miners to a meeting and told them they could start work tomorrow although he had no money, no legal tender, but he would give them a substitute, something which would be just as good if they only believed in it. He showed them the yellow slips of paper and they said: “Well, it is O.K. with us as long as it is O.K. with the butcher, grocer, tailor, cobbler, etc.” When Mr. Hebecker approached the business people with his proposition to accept the Waera instead of “regular money” they, with all due respect to Mr. Hebecker, refused to give their good wares for yellow paper slips. Thus Mr. Hebecker was compelled to establish a canteen, getting its supplies from some warehouses which had been accepting Waera for some years, and where the workers could secure almost all the things they needed for their livelihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The miners began to work, to produce coal, and hundreds of families were supplied with a livelihood. After a few weeks the business and trades people of the town came and lamented to Mr. Hebecker that he had absorbed all the little bit of business they once had, and asked for more information on the ‘Waera”. He explained that the “Waera” would work just as well with them, that the wages of the workers would go to the baker, from him to the butcher, from there to the grocer, from there to the hardware store, from there to the farmer, and vice versa, and that it would remain in perfect circulation all the time, exchanging their services and wares, if they only believed in it, and that, by continued selling and buying, they could gradually enjoy increasing prosperity, as it would be in the nature of things. In order to gain their confidence he obligated himself that if Waera should accumulate here and there in too big amounts to get rid of the Waera Exchange Association would exchange it for legal tender, the Reichsmark. After some hesitation they agreed to accept the “Waera”. Mr. Hebecker closed the canteen, and from that time the economic boom grew in this region and extended into neighboring districts, with the same success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is necessary to know that Waera consist of notes having the peculiarity that they depreciate a fixed amount monthly, for example 1 percent a month, at the expense of the holders. The holder of a note on the 1st of the month has to affix a stamp to it, after which it passes at its full face value for another month. The arrangement can be made for weekly or semi-monthly depreciation with correspondingly less depreciation. This peculiarity has the effect of compelling the owner of Waera, out of self-interest, in order to avoid the depreciation or its accumulation, to put it into circulation. Thus Waera will not be hoarded; it is permanently circulating. It has to come out of the pockets, safes and hiding places, to the market, to buy wares, to pay for services, wages, to be loaned to others, to establish credit in a thousand ways where it is not needed for the buying of goods or to settle debts, etc. Waera is not a money that paralyzes production and distribution and throws man out of employment and his opportunity to produce and create keeping him poor and destitute; Waera is not a money that rules and dominates the nations and oppresses them and leads them to hate and wars; Waera is a money that serves. Waera is a genuine medium of exchange, knowing only one purpose, to serve man. It represents genuine demand, and the volume of Waera issued represents the exact size of the demand on the market. Thus it can be adapted exactly to the supply, and the economic balance of general supply and general demand be restored and maintained, as expressed in the maintenance of the price level and its indication, the index.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ask the workers of Schwanenkirchen what they think of these depreciating money tokens and they will tell you that they never want another money, that they practically have to pay no depreciation, that their Waera goes quickly to the grocer, butcher, baker, etc., or to creditors to pay bills, or to establish credits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ask the business man and he will tell you that in years he did not have the amount of business that he now has with Waera. But what about his paying the depreciation? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font6"> gladly pay the 1% depreciation of the amount in our cash register at the end of the month. It would be bad business to lose a purchaser or a sale for the little depreciation of 1% even if we could not put the tokens into circulation before the date of depreciation. And our creditors accept Waera for the same business reason. But, of course, we are trying, by self-interest, to put Waera into circulation as soon as we have it instead of keeping it idle in our safes. We are paying our employees with it; they in turn, put Waera quickly into circulation for what they need. Most of our stock we are paying for in Waera now, as the Waera Exchange Association has referred us to dealers accepting Waera in payment for their wares. The use of Waera spreads with the passing of each month, the closed circuit grows wider and wider, and its circulation smoother and smoother. Today Waera has displaced almost entirely the legal tender, the Reichsmark, in our district. A branch of the Reichsbank protested against its use, but without result. Waera is not money, but only a medium of exchange as stipulated on it. There is no gold coverage, not even silver coverage for it, as stated on the Waera notes. Waera finds its perfect coverage in the wares on the market that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">need</span><span class="font6"> Waera to be exchanged and in the fact that it is accepted for exchange, for lack of other money, which lies idle in its hiding places, which refuses to serve and which has gone on strike for better wages, i. e., a higher and safer interest rate, without which it will not function for its intended purpose as a medium of exchange. If the mine could have found the necessary amount in legal tender there would have been a short revival of business, until that money had hidden like the rest. We have experienced this several times under the various owners of the mine. Waera is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">perpetuum mobile</span><span class="font6"> of business. It is the solution of the problem of depression all over the world. Legal tender money functions only in periods of inflation, when prices of wares are going up, because only then is it depreciating. But in periods of deflation, of depression as now, when wares are falling in price, money is increasing in price or purchasing power, as they say. Then it refuses to exchange itself for wares which lose in price. But talking to the money owner and moralizing with him will not do. In a period of falling prices no capitalist can afford to come out with his capital and invest it in order to stimulate production. It would mean economic suicide. The general fall of prices has to be avoided by a scientific money administration; but money will be controlled only if we control its rate of circulation. Therefore money should be placed under compulsory circulation. But it would not do for every town or city to issue its own Waera, although a wonderful stimulation, rather an overstimulation, a business fever, would set in, resulting in an inflation, in the long run. Only the Government, not the Reichsbank, acting at present along lines of its private economic interest and not in the public economic interest, can inaugurate the necessary measures. Here is presented to the world a unique example. May they soon see and act upon it, in the interest of the people of all nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An economic theory has been put into partial practice, thus demonstrating the solution of the problem which puzzles the world from one end to the other. We have only to adopt this solution and use it in a scientific way, to produce with mathematical certainty the economic results which our keenest dreams can visualize. We do not appeal to altruism or to qualities of man he does not have, but to his self-interest, which will, rightly directed, benefit his fellow man. The dawn of a new era is here.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Obedience in the Face of Danger</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">F OBEDIENCE to Jehovah God slackens or becomes inoperative in the face of danger, then it ceases to be obedience, doesn’t it? When Esther went into the presence of Ahasuerus without being invited so to do, she knew that she was in danger of death, but that did not keep her from doing what Mordecai had bidden her to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Manifestly, none that count their lives dear  unto themselves will be of “the remnant”. The cause of Jehovah God is worthy of implicit obedience, even though the risk involved not merely temporal death but eternal death. Isn’t that the truth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die” (Rom. 5:7); and, if that is true, what courage, what faithful obedience, what promptness, what thoroughness, ought to arm every true soldier of the Lord who is enlisted in the battle to give the name of the Eternal God the place it should have in his own heart and in the hearts of all?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We hope at this time to give some consideration to an experience in the life of the good king Hezekiah, the one of whom it is said, “He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.”—2 Ki. 18: 5.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Hezekiah an Iconoclast</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">One of the first things that Hezekiah did was to break in pieces the brazen serpent which at Jehovah’s express command Moses had set up for the children of Israel to gaze upon, when bitten by the fiery serpents back there in the wilderness some 833 years previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can be sure that he did not do this without Jehovah’s will in the matter being conveyed to him by some suitable mouthpiece, probably by the Prophet Isaiah, who lived contemporaneously. And, incidentally, that shows that what is Jehovah’s will for one people under certain conditions may not be His will for that same people or for another people living at a different time, under other conditions. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Light goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the time the brazen serpent was erected, the account says, “if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.” (Num. 21:9) We have the full explanation of what this signified, given by the Son of God himself. Jesus said: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”—John 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there came a time when the serpent of brass had accomplished its purpose, and after a great length of time it even became an object of idolatry, for the account says that “unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it” (2 Ki. 18:4); wherefore Hezekiah had it broken up into junk, “and he called it a piece of brass” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(margin),</span><span class="font6"> which, after all, was all it was. As an object of idolatry, it was now of positive injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a lesson here for those Christians (and there are many such) who have faith in Jesus as their Redeemer but never go a step beyond. They prostrate themselves before the cross, yes, but they do not go on to a wholehearted devotion of their lives to the great One who arranged that Jesus should give His life a ransom for us all. They create idols.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hezekiah had the correct view of the matter; for it says, “He clave to Jehovah, and departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses.” (2 Ki. 18:6) As a consequence of thus having the true spirit of worship and of service, it followed, naturally, that “Jehovah was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not”.—2 Ki. 18: 7.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>Resistance to World Power</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">For a peace-loving and virtually unarmed people like the Israelites, it was a bold thing to take a stand against the power of Assyria, which at that time was overrunning the world. The ten-tribe nation was in the revolt, along with the two-tribe nation of Judah, over which Hezekiah reigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was not long before things began to happen to put Hezekiah’s faith to the test. The Assyrians came up, and, after a three years’ siege, captured Samaria, the capital of the ten-tribe nation, and carried all the inhabitants of the ten-tribe realm into captivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was well calculated to strike terror into Hezekiah’s heart; but the Lord was not yet ready to interfere, and the Assyrians next invaded Judah, capturing all the fenced cities except Jerusalem itself. Momentarily overcome with fear, Hezekiah tried to make peace by payments on</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the great fine levied against him. He stripped the king’s house, and even the temple, of gold, silver and other treasures, but all in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At length the Assyrian army invested Jerusalem itself, and the herald, speaking in the Jews’ own tongue, called upon the people of the city to surrender. In coarse and impious language he offered a land of corn and wine, olive oil and honey to those who would rise in insurrection, but death in its vilest forms to those who would stand by Hezekiah and Jehovah his God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Enumerating the gods of several lands that had been overrun by the Assyrians, he said to the Israelites: “Hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the Idng of Assyria?” (2 Ki. 18:32, 33) Subsequently, this message was sent to Hezekiah in written form.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>The Right Place to Go for Help</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Hezekiah did just the right thing with that letter. He went up into the temple, spread it before Jehovah, and prayed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">0 [Jehovah] God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. [Jehovah], bow down thine ear, and hear; open, [Jehovah], thine eyes, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. Of a truth, [Jehovah], the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them. Now therefore, 0 [Jehovah] our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art [Jehovah] God, even thou only.— 2 Ki. 19:15-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That was the way to get results, and the results came right along. Hardly had Hezekiah returned to his home before a messenger from Isaiah was there telling him that his prayer against Sennacherib had been heard. He was to sent back word to the impious letter-writer that because he had dared to blaspheme the name of the Holy One of Israel, therefore “the virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah. For I will defend this city to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.”—2 Ki. 19: 21, 32-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That very night Sennacherib’s army of 185,000 men was slain by the angel of Jehovah God. Quite likely the same one that slew the firstborn of Egypt in defense of the name of Jehovah God was the one selected for the task, and that one may have been and quite probably was “the Messenger of the Covenant”, the One that will have the direction of the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name in the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hezekiah did the right thing. He pleaded his cause, and the cause of his people, and he pleaded for the vindication of the good name of his God in the place where it counts. He did it in the face of danger. Most certainly he would have been put to death had Sennacherib’s army made entrance into the city. He was granted a complete deliverance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>Obedience to the Higher Powers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">He was obedient to the Higher Powers, even when it involved disobedience to the ruler that at the time had the whole world in his control. He resisted that ruler and the one that was back of him, the Devil, because it was right that they should be resisted, yet his resistance took only the form of witnessing to Jehovah’s name and then pleading his cause with Him who judges righteously and whose judgment is backed with all power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally, without any fault of their own (though, sometimes, with regret it must be admitted, not without some blame for indiscreet and ill-considered language), Jehovah’s witnesses today get into difficulty with those who represent the ruler of the darkness of this world, even as Hezekiah got in trouble with the representatives of Sennacherib.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>Recent Experience at Newburgh</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Not properly understanding our work, the police at Newburgh, N. Y., had until recently forbidden our folks to attend to their duties in that city, whereupon arrangements were made to give the town a thorough witness, that this improper condition might be permanently corrected. About a hundred ears, with 310 workers, participated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the usual notice was served upon the chief of police he seemed displeased at first, said he had had trouble with these people before, and that he would take it up with the mayor if we came again. He was advised that the workers were already in town, that their work had begun, that someone would call upon him shortly, and that he ought to make no decision until they should come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first worker that reached his door was turned away by the chief’s wife, but returned, saying he wished to see the chief, and then gave him the witness. His attitude changed and he said, “I will take these six booklets for a quarter.” Just at that time the lieutenant called up from headquarters advising him that about a dozen had been arrested, and wanting to know what to do. The chief said, “I have just got some of those books myself; why don’t you get some? If you want to arrest them, go ahead and do it, but on your own responsibility.” The lieutenant then said to his men, “You have got me in Dutch here; the chief says this is all right.” With that he took six of the booklets. An officer also took a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font6"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later, another officer accosted one of our workers and asked him if he had books. He replied that he had. (He was expecting arrest.) A lady came along and said, “Is not this terrible, these folks’ being on the streets with these books?” The officer replied, “There is a dreadful condition in the world and something should be done about it; I want to get some of the books myself.” Thereupon he invested in a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font6"> book. The lady was so impressed that she obtained four of the bound books.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>God’s Will Done at Rockville</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Several months ago two of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested at Rockville, Conn., a city near Hartford, and had a court trial there. The district attorney, Noone, made a pressing issue out of it, claiming that this work is just a racket and that he was going to see that the county was rid of these people. It is evident that the religious element was back of his ill-placed zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This man had the reputation of never having lost a case before the supreme court. At the end of the trial the judge withheld his decision, apparently out of respect for the attorney, and the workers were released on suspended sentence. After a vicious attack upon the organization the district attorney collapsed, had a stroke, and died about four months later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the day that he was buried there was a long funeral procession in his honor; much mention was made of it in the press, and of a song sung on the occasion of the funeral, “God’s Will Be Done.” There is not the least doubt that God’s will was done, for on the very day (September 17) that this Roman Catholic opposer of God’s kingdom went to his grave Jehovah’s witnesses visited Rockville in force.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>Extend Every Courtesy to the Erring</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It is customary to file with the police department a list of names and addresses of those who have come into the town or city to give the testimony. In addition to the list there is filed at the same time a letter stating that God’s kingdom is the only hope of the world and that Jehovah’s witnesses have come to give testimony of this fact to the people of the town. Also a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World,</span><span class="font6"> is presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The identity of Jehovah’s witnesses is thereby definitely established, so that the officials may not mistake them as peddlers or hawkers, or as engaged in commercial activity for private or personal gain, but that they may be recognized in their true status as preachers or heralds of the gospel of God’s kingdom, engaged in doing the work of God, and that they are moving about in the community in performance of a good work and not as evildoers or lawbreakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A committee with the above list and message called upon the Rockville chief of police at his home so that he might be extended the courtesies proper under the circumstances. When he learned that it was the same class of people he had previously arrested he said, vehemently, “I will have nothing to do with Jehovah,” and refused to take the papers proffered to him. Thereupon he turned and ran into his house to get his uniform and rushed down to the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At that time there were more than a hundred witnesses covering the town. Five of these witnesses preceded the chief into his office at police headquarters, laid the rejected letter and list of names on the desk there, and departed just as the chief entered the building. On this occasion there was no move made to arrest any of the heralds of Jehovah’s kingdom. (Ten days later this same chief, after his day’s work, went to his home, retired, was stricken in bed, and the funeral was held in the same Roman Catholic church where the quartet had sung “God’s Will Be Done” when the remains of the chief’s comrade Noone, the prosecuting attorney, were lying there.)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>Jehovah’s Power Manifested at Hartford</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The next day, Sunday, the witness was given in Hartford with 170 cars and 819 workers. A most interesting fact is that prior to the gathering together of these workers, and before it was known how many cars there would be, the town had been divided into 170 parts. Hence there was just one carload of workers for each district. Manifestly Jehovah’s power in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is of interest to note the order of procedure of the working groups taking their respective positions in the army of the Lord on these occasions. Each car group of workers goes to its assigned place at exactly nine o’clock after being checked in at the assembly point. When the work of witnessing in the field is completed the car returns at a specified time to the assembly point and makes report and receives instruction </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">regard to further action for the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Special attention was paid to serving the public officials: the secretary of public welfare of the State of Connecticut, the chiefs of police in Hartford and West Hartford, the sheriff of the county, and the United States district attorney. Each read very carefully the notice prepared for such occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At first the chief of police at Hartford questioned whether the witnesses had the right to enter the town on this errand. He was assured that they came only to do the people good, that they were not coming there asking a permit, but were asking that they be not interfered with. He was handed the list of Jehovah’s witnesses, so that they might be identified in their proper status.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About twelve of the witnesses were picked up, but when brought into headquarters they were released, and on several occasions were taken back to the territory from which they had been brought. There were 16,500 testimonies given in Hartford, an average of twenty per worker. This resulted in the placing of 6,240 books and booklets, besides a number of copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>Former Experiences at Albany</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It has been observed at Albany, N. Y., and at </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">many </span><span class="font6">other places where Jehovah’s witnesses </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">experienced difficulty, that the opposing officials at first assume a rather arrogant and blustering manner. They do this until after Jehovah’s name is mentioned, when their manner changes. It seems that on such occasions the angels of Jehovah drive away the angels of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Albany Jehovah’s witnesses had been threatened time and again that they would be immediately arrested if seen on the streets with the books. The result was that Albany did not have a thorough witness for two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was therefore decided that as it is the capital of the “Empire State”, and as the present governor is running for president of the United States, the people should have a thorough witness of Jehovah’s government, which witness was given September 25. The chief of police was called upon with a list of 507 names of Jehovah’s witnesses who had come to town to give the message that His kingdom at hand is the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After waiting a few minutes, at the request of the desk sergeant, the chief of police came in and was shown the list of men and women in all walks of life, together with their addresses, and was told, ‘Jehovah, the true and living God, has a message for the people at this time. We are His witnesses and have come to your city to preach the good news that His kingdom is at hand, and that it is the only hope of the world. We have every reason to believe that the people as a whole are waiting for this message and will be glad to receive it We have come here to do a good work, and the purpose of furnishing this list is that Jehovah’s witnesses may be identified in their proper status.’</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark180"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>Jehovah’s Hand at Albany</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">The chief said, ‘Gentlemen, I am glad you have come here. I am glad to have this letter. I believe you are doing a good work. I have heard your lectures over the radio. If there is anything that my men can do, any service we can perform, I shall be very glad to have you call upon us. Where are you meeting? I am led to admit that God’s kingdom is, as you people say, the only hope, and we cannot have too much reminding us of it. I remember that I received previously a book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World.’</span><span class="font6"> (One of the Albany workers remembered that when she called upon him last year the chief gave her fifty cents for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font6"> booklet.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Albany experience demonstrated that when officers there had been interfering with Jehovah’s witnesses they were not acting under the authority of the chief of police, but evidently under the authority of the clergy and of the Devil’s angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">None of the workers at Albany were molested on September 25. The result of the united action on this occasion was the giving of 8,400 testimonies and the placing of 4,400 books and booklets in the homes of 2,400 families as their portion of Jehovah’s feast for the people of good will at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An interesting item was that several college boys came down from Troy. One of them said, “My parents are in this work and we came down to see what we can do. We have been reading some of these books and we want to know what you have to do to get into this thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They were told that if they wanted to magnify Jehovah’s name and purposes and to call attention to the fact that His prophecies are being fulfilled, and if they wished to do something to help vindicate His name, they would be very welcome to go along, which they did. They got in on the ground floor in the campaign at Albany, wanted to know where the next one would occur, and announced that they would be there, too.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>No Change in Human Nature</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">There has been no change in human nature from Hezekiah’s day until now. At its best, after six thousand years of deflection from Jehovah, it is none too good. At its worst it is lower than the lowest animals, for there are no animals so low as to kill one another with poison gas or liquid fire, and to do it often without even knowing why they do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With his superior intelligence the Devil readily controls most men, as he did Sennacherib and his great host that overran Palestine and threatened the capture of Jerusalem. Here and there are men and women, God’s remnant in the earth, who wholly love and wholly trust Jehovah God. When they go forth to bring honor to His name they go in the face of danger, but they go-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Hezekiah faced certain imprisonment, with probable death, at the hands of Sennacherib's army, if they had gained the victory, so the men and women who went to Rockville and Hartford and Newburgh and Albany faced at least temporary deprivation of their liberties, with death eventually if the Devil and his evil angels, visible and invisible, could have their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hezekiah was granted a great deliverance; he saw his enemies prostrated before him, and his life was spared for future usefulness. This favor was granted to him because Jehovah’s name was at stake, and because he had pleaded that fact at the throne of heavenly grace. He was obedient in the face of danger, and was rewarded for that obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any man or woman can be obedient, and should despise himself for being anything else, when there is no risk involved. But how could the heavenly Father determine who alone of all mankind are worthy of a place in the divine family except by allowing just such conditions as now obtain in the earth, where, on occasion, it requires something more than mere words to demonstrate who are on the Lord’s side?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyway, the opportunity to take a firm stand for Jehovah God is the greatest favor any mortal can have. And the opportunity is still here. Those young college boys are finding their way into God’s kingdom, while many of the goodygoodies who in times past have thought they were Christians will be shown by events to be the Devil’s prisoners, or, even worse than that, at heart his children all the time, and only masquerading as Christians in the hope that they could use the Bible as a fire escape to climb up into a comfortable place where they could spend eternity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6">S A constant reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> I enjoy most of the articles as they appear from time to time. Many of the articles are of very great importance to humanity; and, working in a large public hospital, I have had opportunities of telling others of the good things I have learned by my readings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Aluminium [aluminum] question” is no longer a question to me, and, having come into possession of a little more information from an</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“authoritative” source, I am passing it along to you for your use as you may desire. It appeared as follows, in the April 16 (1932) issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The British Medical Journal,</span><span class="font6"> page 727, under the heading “Correspondence”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ALUMINIUM AND HEALTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sm,—Your article on aluminium and health in the issue of March 26 is very interesting, and shows how strong is the evidence that aluminium is harmless to the majority of people. At the same time, there is no doubt that in a certain number of cases it acts as an irritant poison, and when a subject is anaphylactic to aluminium it is surprising how infinitesimal a quantity is sufficient to cause trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To take my own case. For many years I suffered from severe abdominal pain, which at times completely incapacitated me. It baffled all attempts at diagnosis, and it was only the length of time during which the pain had persisted that ruled out the general belief in its malignant origin. After reading Dr. Ie Hunte Cooper’s pamphlet I stopped the use of aluminium vessels, and in a short time the pain disappeared. Some time later the pain returned, and was particularly severe on two days in each week. The most careful inquiry failed to trace any connexion with aluminium, until I noticed that on these particular days I was in the habit of having a certain article of prepared food. On writing to the makers of the food I was informed that it was prepared in aluminium vessels, but I was assured that repeated tests showed that it contained no trace of aluminium. On leaving off this food the pain again disappeared. Since then I have had, on several occasions, a return of pain, but each time I found that I had had something cooked in aluminium. I am now so anaphylactic to it that I would undertake to tell by sampling it whether any article of food had touched aluminium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have six cases in which stopping the use of aluminium vessels has put an end to abdominal pain. in one case a man who had suffered acutely for six months got complete relief as soon as he stopped it. Some time later his pain returned, when he found that for some days his porridge had inadvertently been boiled in an aluminium saucepan. On stopping this, the pain again disappeared. A characteristic feature of “aluminium pain” is that it is not relieved by the ordinary carminatives and sedatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not wise to be too dogmatic on any subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am, etc.,</span></p>
