<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Earliest Inhabitants of Terra Firma—The Birds</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>In Three Parts —</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Part 1</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">L</span><span class="font5">OOKING at the account of creation, we see that the work of the fifth creative day •was to populate the sea and the air. After the denizens of the deep had been brought forth, there followed the creation of “every winged fowl after his kind”. Of birds, 12,000 species still exist; 500 species are extinct. The land animals were brought forth in the sixth creative day, man himself at its close. Birds had probably lived on the earth close to ten thousand years before man ever stepped foot on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Birds are queer things, almost as queer as men, but not quite. An odd thing about birds is that it is the males that are the best dressed. Some of the things about their migrations are so strange as to be unbelievable if they were not known to be true. There are no migrations toward the south polar regions, at breeding time. How is it that millions of birds that are mere infants, that have never migrated before, and whose parents are not with them, go unerringly thousands of miles to winter in the places where their parents wintered before them? This is true of certain species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And how is it that a great flock of these birds, several different species, will start together but at the appropriate place one species will head straight south for Peru or Patagonia while another will head west for California and another east for Florida? A bird-lover in Panama observed that the same swallow returned to the same neighborhood three years in succession, and in each instance started to build its nest on January 8. The fourth year it was three days late, starting to build on the 11th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the three hundred and odd places in the Scriptures in which birds are mentioned, about thirty of the three hundred and forty-eight species which visit Palestine are mentioned by name: the dove, eagle, raven, cock, hen, owl, pigeon, sparrow, stork, pelican, quail, swallow, vulture, ostrich, bittern, peacock, cormorant, crane, partridge, ossifrage, osprey, kite, cuckoo, hawk, heron, night hawk, lapwing, glede, swan and gier eagle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Birds have large inhabitiveness. Besides the two-legged birds that frequent the Rouen cathedral, it is said to be the permanent home of 900 pigeons, 250 bats, 60 hawks, 40 owls and 35 ravens. A Norwalk (Connecticut) farmer finds his home a center for about 3,000 birds which he has so far found no effective means of driving away. Birds prefer to live in homes that have a rustic or weathered look rather than in those gaily painted.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Many Friends and Many Enemies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Just why anybody would wish to live in a birdless world is hard to understand, but there are thousands of so-called ‘sportsmen’ whose one principal ambition seems to be to see how much of bird life they can slaughter. As a result, the number of large birds is rapidly decreasing. They are easier to hit, and they suffer more when woods and forests are cleared. In some portion of every year about 5,000,000 sportsmen go out to shoot waterfowl, and it is no wonder they are being thinned out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canada now has forty federal bird sanctuaries, and there are or have been about seventy in the United States. In this country 154,744 acres have been purchased at a cost of $4 to $6 an acre and 65,970 acres have been set aside by presidential proclamation, as safety zones for our feathered friends, and the birds are beginning to know where they are safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On an acre lot at South Deerfield, Mass., a bird-lover supplies short lengths of twine, short and narrow strips of white cloth, cotton batting and white tissue paper, and provides a free lunch counter, with the result that the place usually has fifteen or twenty nests and the proprietor is repaid for his work by the songs of thrushes, catbirds and rose-breasted grosbeaks, and an ever-decreasing number of insect pests. A ruby-crowned kinglet, yellow warblers, che-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">bees, redstarts, orioles, robins and chipping sparrows have made use of the building materials and reared their babies on the place. It does not take much to make many birds happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the age of thirteen a boy in the Ozarks, Guy Greenwell, Joplin, Mo., can identify seven hundred and fifty birds and animals from pictures, and describe their habits. He is in great demand every summer as an instructor of Boy Scout and Y.M.C.A. groups and is able to answer immediately and learnedly about 98 percent of all the questions put to him regarding bird life. His father is in the poultry business, and the boy himself seems to be a natural-born enthusiast on bird life in all its aspects.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Bird Life an Interesting Study</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">There are many things about birds that we cannot understand, and for this reason, and because they are so much like human creatures, they interest us. The higher types of birds are like the higher types of humankind: they select their mates and remain true to them throughout life. The qualities common among men are common among birds: love, jealousy, vanity, fear, courage, cowardice, sociability, playfulness, gluttony, and devotion to the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The study of bird life is as innocent a diversion and as fascinating as any in which humans engage; yet one who stands and watches the birds for a few minutes is often thought to be unbalanced. One gentleman in a town, suburban to New York, was questioned by a policeman concerning his peculiar conduct. The officer confided to him that the residents of the little town thought him so queer as to require watching. “Do they?” exclaimed the amazed old gentleman. “How very extraordinary! Here is my card. It may explain matters.” The card read, “Professor Malcolm Ogilvie, New York Ornithological Society, 53 Jane Street, New York.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Government experts estimate that Maryland has the most numerous bird life, with an average of seven pairs to the acre, while the arid lands of the Southwest have the smallest bird population. The Eastern states are estimated to harbor over two billion native field birds. The Bronx Zoo, in New York city, contains 800 varieties, ranging in size from the tiny humming bird, but little over an inch in length, to the ostrich, seven feet in height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The birds give us food to eat and clothes to wear. Without them successful agriculture w’ould be an impossibility. They insure the growth of our shade trees, and dispose of the caterpillars which otherwise would drop down the backs of our necks when we walk beneath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An interesting and curious service which certain birds render in the Thana district of India is to plant the seeds of the tall Palmyra palms in the tops of Bengal fig trees, making it seem that one variety of tree is growing out of another ; and such, in fact, is actually the case. At all times these parasite palms look singular, but especially when young, the foliage being so different from that of the fig.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Value of Birds</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The Department of Agriculture estimates that the passage of the Migratory Bird Law, which forbids the shooting of game birds in the spring, has already gained in food to the nation not less than $20,000,000. In some districts where the birds had become almost extinct the numbers are rapidly increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a purely economic standpoint it may be said that there are six classes of birds which are useful to mankind: those that destroy insects, those that destroy weed seed, those that destroy small rodents, those that serve as scavengers, those that serve as game, and those that supply eggs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the standpoint of satisfaction of our senses of sight and sound there are few more pleasant things in nature than birds. They are graceful in repose and in flight, many of them beautifully colored and some of them with happy little songs that cheer the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowledge of the value of birds has so progressed in the North that song birds are regarded as an asset, and farmers do not permit the killing of them on their lands. In the South there is much killing of birds for food and for sport, and some regard this as one explanation for the spread of the boll weevil, which has done so much to destroy the South’s best crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Realizing that cats are the natural enemies of birds and do more than any other creatures to decimate bird life, some bird-lovers are earning on a campaign for the extermination of all the cats in the world. Their claim is that cats never kill insects, and that but for the birds the insects would in a few years destroy all crops and all green things. (How about mice and rats?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But there are other foes to birds. The marquis of Ripon, reputed to be the best shot in the world, killed 88,355 birds in the years 1889-1894, and was stricken with death at the end of a morning’s shooting in which he had bagged fifty-six brace of grouse. Perhaps He who ‘marks the sparrow’s fall’ gave the marquis something of poetic justice. When he awakens in the resurrection he will be less eager to take what he cannot give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Slaughter of the birds has already made many species extinct. One of the best collections of stuffed birds is that of the American Museum of Natural History, recently enriched by the famous collection of birds of Baron Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Our Feathered Friends</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">There are several things which almost any person can do for the birds. Winter birds can be fed; fruit-bearing shrubs can be planted that will furnish food for the birds, as well as be attractive in themselves; pans of water can be put out for the birds in times of drought; cats and air guns can be reduced in number or controlled; and nesting boxes can be put up for bluebirds, wrens, martins, tree swallows and other holenesting birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tendency to drain every marsh and clean up every bit of underbrush can be restrained somewhat. If overdone it would leave almost no place in which the birds could find a natural home. It is getting harder and harder every year for the birds to find nesting places and feeding grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York State College of Forestry recommends the native red cedar as not only an excellent tree for ornamental purposes, but as also providing an excellent shelter and nesting site for birds. They also find food in the berries and insects commonly found on the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The native flowering dogwood and the Chinese flowering crab apple are two particularly beautiful trees that are favorites with the birds. The grey-stemmed dogwood, honeysuckle, American elder and sheepberry are also serviceable to the birds and ornamental. The Virginia creeper, one of the most popular vines, furnishes nesting sites for birds and draws the attention of the birds away from grapes, apples and peaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Teachers are doing something for the birds by teaching the young the value, the preciousness, of each little individual life, how easy it is to take it and how impossible to give it back. Children can be taught that it is a crime to molest the homes and steal and destroy the young of defenseless fellow creatures.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>A Bird Tavern and a Bird Hospital</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">There is a bird tavern in New York, where choice birds are provided with fresh fruit, vegetables and salads, and entertained with dolls, bells and balls. One of the guests is a cockatoo, with a white coat, a beautiful crest and a salmon chest. This bird, Coca, laughs at a funny story, drinks from a glass, swears, washes and feeds a china doll, and wraps himself in a newspaper when he sleeps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Memphis woman who operates a pet shop specializes in restoring the voices of canaries. President Roosevelt was a great bird-lover and ■was responsible for several bird reservations, at the mouth of the Mississippi, in Florida, in Oregon, in the Aleutian islands, and elsewhere. Audubon societies for the preservation of birds have been formed in forty states. London is the headquarters of an international committee for carrying on propaganda for the preservation of birds. One of its proposals is governmental prohibition of the sale of feathers of rare birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The island of St. Kilda, seven miles in circumference, located off the Hebrides, will henceforth be a bird sanctuary for the sea birds which migrate there in large numbers. The owner will permit no buildings of any kind to be constructed on the island.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Many Bird Catastrophes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">A bird-lover says: “Many perils beset the bird: cats, wild beasts, snakes, boys, gunners, parasites, disease, famine, thirst, windstorms, hail, sleet and snowstorms, forest fires, brush fires, and bandit birds, such as owls, hawks, crows, jays and other feathered pillagers that eat the eggs of other birds and kill fledglings and full-grown birds. Millions of land birds— the sparrows, warblers, redstarts, indigo buntings and all the other migrants—lose their lives in storms at sea.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to avoid the larger birds, most of the smaller ones make their migrations at night. In the darkness they have several foes. Winds blow them out of their course. Tall, dark objects across their paths are not seen. As many as 150 bird corpses have been found at the base of Washington monument in a single morning. Lighthouses with a steady white light bewilder them; they turn aside and weary themselves going around and around the light until they fall to the ground or into the sea. Bird deaths at the Statue of Liberty run to 700 per month. English lighthouses are equipped with perches for the convenience of bewildered birds attracted by the lights. Many lives are thus saved. A flashing light frightens the birds away; they will not come near a red one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bird catastrophes are sometimes witnessed. In September, 1879, a violent storm over Lake Michigan strewed the eastern shore of the lake with about half a million dead birds, as nearly as could be estimated. On one occasion passengers on a vessel thirty miles off the mouth of the Mississippi river witnessed the death of hundreds of birds. They had been flying north across the gulf of Mexico, but encountered a “norther” with which they were unable to contend, and were compelled to drop into the gulf and drown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In November, 1923, thousands of birds, blown out to sea by unfavorable winds, landed on the Cunard liner Scythia, and stayed on board until she docked in Liverpool. These birds were probably migrating from the North Atlantic states to the northern shores of South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Birds have some means of notifying each other of districts to be avoided. In the Sandwich islands are certain caves filled with volcanic gases. These caves are deadly to all life; but it is a noteworthy fact that no birds are ever seen in that vicinity, though everywhere else in the islands they are extremely plentiful.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Migrations of Birds</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Unlike man, who seems more ready to shift his home to where he is afforded the most favorable conditions for existence, most birds cling tenaciously to the immediate surroundings in which they were cradled, when it comes to a selection of a nesting site. This fact was first demonstrated by sea birds known to breed on certain islands, and on these only. More recently it has been shown that many of the lesser birds cling persistently to their nesting site; and it has even been found that some not only seek the same general region, but the same shelf of rocks and even the same nest year after year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is only a few hundred years since people believed that the birds which disappeared on the edge of winter flew to some undiscovered satellite near the earth. Now the summer and winter habitats of many birds are known. Certain birds travel unerringly between certain portions of Chile and places in the United States. The winter resorts of Europe’s birds are the valleys of the Nile and Congo. Canadian birds are found in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Europe there are now some twenty organizations interested in bird banding. The device finally settled upon as most satisfactory is a numbered aluminum band or ring, attached to the tarsus, or bare portion of the leg. By this means much valuable information has been collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The greater number of birds migrate at altitudes about 3,000 feet above the earth, although by means of instruments so fixed as to scan the surface of the moon some have been discerned at 15,100 feet. The density of the air at such a height is only half what it is at sea level. In the South it is observed that birds which go north latest in the spring return earliest in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Migration is for food. Robins and certain other birds will not migrate from Connecticut to the South if fed regularly all winter. Birds are great eaters, many breeds eating several times the weight of their bodies in the course of a day. They can do this because much of their food consists of insects and worms, composed largely of water, which imposes very little tax on the digestive organs. Some birds in the Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, will eat nothing but snakes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Bat—Bee-Eater—Bengalese—Bluebird</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">It is rather a joke, in an article on birds, to start with a bird that is a mammal and not a true bird; but a bat has wings, and for the moment he interests us. Bats’ wings are so exquisi-tively sensitive that when the eyes are completely destroyed the bat can still avoid strings or wires stretched across his path of flight, can approach a wall at ease, alight upon a perch, or even find a small cavity. When mama bat goes foraging she takes the little ones along and deposits them on the branch of a tree where they can witness her work in their behalf. A bat cannot rise from a perfectly level surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bee-eater, a small, richly plumaged and graceful bird of southern Europe and northern Africa, has learned that an easy way to make a living is to hang around a beehive or a wasps’ nest and eat the bees or wasps as they come forth. It has learned how to avoid being stung. The bee or wasp is taken to a perch and beaten to death, and the sting removed before eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bengalese, a Japanese bird, is of peculiar interest to aviculturists because of the fact that it is willing to reproduce its species in a state of captivity. It has no song worth mentioning, but is very tame and docile. The bird is found only in the domesticated state, and is so thoroughly used to captivity that it does better in a small cage than a large one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A bluebird is a bird to make you glad you are alive to see it and to hear its melodious song. Someone has said: “To associate with him and to gaze on his tender little ones is to give your broken spirit such a bath of beauty and wholesomeness, and to create such a consuming interest in the general plan of things in the world, that you are completely overwhelmed by everything as the Creator has made it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bluebird is very common in the eastern part of the United States, and one of our earliest visitors to arrive from the South in the spring. The male is bright blue, with the breast reddish. Missouri has adopted the bluebird officially as its state bird.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Bluethroat—Bobolink—Bower Bird—Bustard</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">The bluethroat, called by the Laplanders “the bird of the hundred voices”, spends its winters in India or central Africa, and its summers in Alaska, Siberia, Russia or Scandinavia. It is never seen in intermediate countries, and is believed to take its three-thousand-mile journey at a single flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bobolink has an interesting and eventful life. In the early spring he visits the Louisiana and South Carolina rice fields and does his part in destroying young plants. A little latei, dressed in his richest garb, he sings at the top of his voice, “Bob-o-link, bob-o-link, spink, spank, spink.” He is inordinately proud of his family. In August he visits the shores of Chesapeake bay, where his wife is shot and sent to market as a reedbird. A month or so later he is shot himself in a rice field farther south, where he is known as a ricebird. That is the last of him, except for the family of five he left behind him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bower bird of Australia and neighboring islands is so called because the males build bowers or playhouses, dome-shaped, a few inches long, floored with twigs. The ornaments are bright feathers, bits of glass, or anything bright. One variety builds a run three feet long, a platform of twigs with a hedge of upright twigs at either side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bustard. Well, that is an Old World wild turkey. A great pouch, opening under the tongue, is developed in the throat of the male during the breeding season, but we do not know the reason, and nobody knows the reason as yet, and that is &quot;all there is to that.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Butcher Bird—Catbird—Condor—Cormorant</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">As we are running along in this little article in an alphabetical order, there are some who would expect some mention about here of the familiar blackbird, blackcap, bobwhite, and buzzard; but these birds are respectively the grackle, titmouse, quail, and vulture, and will come along in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is all bad enough, but we intended, next thing, to take up the birds whose names begin with the third letter in the alphabet, when, behold, it transpired that a canary is a finch, a cardinal is a finch, and a chaffinch is a finch. It seems that the birds have many aliases. We shall try to treat them under their proper names. The finch family must be a big family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The butcher bird operates a meat shop. As fast as he kills small birds, mice, or other small forms of life he impales the bodies upon thorns and lets them hang there until wanted. Sometimes he has as many as nine pieces of meat hung up at one time. The Germans call the butcher birds “nine-killers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The catbird is a mighty interesting bird. In the first place, it has the power to meow like a cat; in the second place, it can imitate instrumental music; in the third place, it often feeds and raises the young of other birds; and in the fourth place, it is a sworn enemy of the common blacksnake, which, in the absence of the bird, seems to take a particular delight in rifling the catbird’s nest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The condor is the largest bird that flies. The true condor is a native of the South American Andes, but specimens have been known to visit California and Europe. In 1922, high in the Alps mountains a mother engaged in weeding the garden left her baby sitting on a blanket on the grass. A condor swooped down and seized the child. Its father saw the act, ran for his gun, and, being an expert shot, brought the bird to the ground. It fell so slowly that the child was only slightly injured. The wing-spread of this bird was found to be seventeen feet and five inches. Condors fly at enormous altitudes, and have wonderful eyes and keen sense of smell. The name is derived from an old Indian word meaning ‘a good smeller’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cormorant is the prize fish-catcher, and pursues a fish under water with inconceivable rapidity. Chinese fishermen train cormorants to catch fish. A ring on the neck prevents the bird from swallowing the fish until the owner is satisfied. Cormorants find pleasure in playing with live fish in the same way that a cat plays with a mouse. The fish is tossed into the air and caught again and again in the spacious bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cowbird—Crane—Creeper</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cowbird and the cuckoo are spongers. They build no nests of their own, but deposit their eggs among those of other birds, which do their work for them and furnish the home free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A whooping crane, when erect, holds his head nearly as high as a man. These birds make their homes in the marshes, where they seek their food. In flight they soar above the clouds, traveling in V-shaped formation, with the leader trumpeting instructions to those that follow. The call notes of the leader, and the responses of the flock, can often be heard when the entire flock is out of sight above the clouds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cranes migrate annually from the arctics to the tropics, and vice versa, varying their flights according to atmospheric conditions. When their flight is high and silent it is regarded as an indication of continued fine weather. In cloudy, wet or stormy weather they fly low and are noisy. The crane flies always with his neck extended straight ahead. The crowned crane of northern Africa has a tuft of feathers about his head which is larger than the head itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The common or brown creeper makes his living in the woods. He selects a tree, starts at the base and goes around and around in spirals all the way to the top. He clings to the bark with his feet, partially supporting himself by the aid of his twelve stiff tailfeathers, and, as he climbs, picks insects and their eggs from the crevices. If an egg is beyond the reach of his sharp bill lie has the power to protrude his tongue still farther and transport it to his palate with neatness and dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Crow Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crow family, widely scattered over the world, includes the common crow, jay, magpie, raven and rook; and a bigger lot of thieves and crooks it would be hard to find outside of Wall Street, a theological seminary, or a political convention. While building their nest in the spring it is necessary for one of the pair to be constantly on watch while the other is bringing building materials, else the crow neighbors are liable to grab some of the structure and run off with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as the nest is finished and the eggs produced (five bluish green, with dark blotches) the male takes it upon himself to supply the entire household with food. The same nests are repaired and used year after year. Intruders are most unwelcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Robert Sparks Walker, writing in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Dumb Animals,</span><span class="font5"> says of crow intelligence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ten years ago, I tried to assist a movie-camera man to film the crow’s behavior about the common roosting place; and today we are as far from our objective as we were the day we ventured into his roosting quarters. We concealed ourselves in a dense thicket of pines in which thousands of crows were wont to roost, and when the first black fellow came in, he spied us before he alighted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a few unsavory accusations directed at us, he hurried away and met the incoming band and notified them of our presence in their camp; there other couriers were dispatched. As a result of this rapid precaution, not a single crow came into the thicket, but all of them moved on to oilier forest trees out of our reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once in a while a crow carries off a young chicken, or maybe once in a while he eats the eggs of a wild bird, and he does get into the corn patch; but it is now believed that as a general rule he does more good to the farmer than he does harm. He can be frightened away from the corn patch, and the young chickens can be kept near the house. A small stone placed on each growing melon will keep him away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One-fifth of a crow’s diet is of the most destructive insect pests known to the farmer. The stomachs of more than 2,000 crows have been examined. One of these contained 85 beetles, another contained 72 wireworms, a third contained 123 locusts, and a fourth contained no less than 483 small caterpillars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rook is a European crow, differing slightly in appearance from the American bird, and with a voice less harsh. The English rooks are true Britishers: they hate to leave the island where they were born. They are gregarious and loquacious, uttering thirty to forty different notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crow’s appetite for the eyes of animals is particularly atrocious. He will eat the eyes of live kids, lambs and fawns, and has even been known to pick out the eyes of small children. Instances are on record where crows have been known to alight on the ears of a deer and peck at its eyes. While a hawk or an owl will endeavor to kill its prey as quickly as possible, the crow will leisurely eat its victims alive.</span></p>

The net result is that he has five workers for every four he had before, and the total wages paid are the same. In other words, the remedy which Big Business has endorsed (and which is sponsored by Walter C.

From there on to the freezing point it expands, and this explains why ice is lighter than water, for 1,000 parts of ice in melting produces only 917 parts of water.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Depression in the United States </span><span class="font4">(As viewed by the New York correspondent of the Manchester </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">T IS almost impossible for a European to realize the depth of the psychological panic which in recent months has gripped a majority of the Americans. The people of this country had been nourishing themselves for years on doctrines about “a new plateau of prosperity”. It had been generally assumed that the rising stock market would go on for ever and make everyone rich, and it is hardly surprising that when the bottom fell out of the stock market it seemed to many people like the end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The depression has been the more severe, of course, because there is no sort of public unemployment insurance to cushion the shock. The unemployed are reduced sooner or later to living on charity. Where many people are out of work the tradespeople themselves go bankrupt and cannot pay their creditors, and the circle of repudiation and bankruptcy grows ever wider. Another reason for the general condition of hysteria is the well-justified lack of confidence in the banks. Something like 4,000 of these have failed since the depression began, and in hundreds of cases the depositors have lost all, or nearly all, of their money. Most people leave their money in the banks, but worry about it. Runs are rather frequent, and the bankers, alarmed at the prospect of sudden withdrawals, are keeping abnormally large amounts in currency in their vaults. This accounts for much of the “hoarding” which is so denounced in the press. Of the rest, a great part is hoarding by people of comparative wealth, as is evidenced by the fact that much of the money which has disappeared from active circulation is $500 and $1,000 notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the apprehension which is felt here is, of course, well justified by the facts. There are in America today probably between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 unemployed, as well as millions more who work only part time. The curtailment of security values has wiped out perhaps $80,000,000,000 of paper wealth. In the two cities of New York and Chicago alone about 1,400,000 persons are absolutely dependent upon charity, and there are proportionate numbers in almost all the other cities. The agricultural regions are equally hard hit. Cotton, wheat, and other staples are selling far below the cost of production. In one state, Mississippi, one-quarter of the farm land has been offered for sale to meet unpaid taxes, and in many other states an equal proportion of the farmers are technically in default and are allowed to continue in possession simply because no one is in sight to take over their farms if they are dispossessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With all this suffering the people are singularly docile. The police keep mobilizing to prevent disorders, but thus far disorders are practically nonexistent. The Communists have taken advantage of the situation, of course, and have staged many parades, protest meetings, and the like; but, generally speaking, I am aware of no evidence that anyone participates in these except the party members, and they do so as a matter of discipline and not because they are actually in a mood to riot. We may see hungermarches and the smashing of shop windows next winter, but thus far there have been extremely few genuine activities of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One could fill a whole volume with the saddening incidents of human suffering which have followed in the wake of the depression. The number of street beggars has been greatly increased, and probably some of them are genuinely in distress, though, as usual in such times, the professional mendicants are to the fore and are reaping a harvest. Probably the worst suffering is, as usual, endured behind closed doors and with the blinds drawn. Nearly thirty people died of starvation in New York city in 1931, and nearly seventy others were rescued by public hospitals in the nick of time, and things were even worse in some other places, such as Detroit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “white-collar worker” has been particularly hard hit. Many thousands of skilled professional and clerical men and women are without employment. One hears of people living in fashionable Park Avenue apartments in New York who are actually without food. They, of course, can pay no rent, and stay on only through the indulgence of the landlord. All sorts of fantastic and pitiful schemes for making money are being tried by these people, and, of course, almost invariably without result. Thousands of college students have been forced to give up their studies because of poverty, but thousands more continue to study because there is nothing else for them to do. Some of the colleges are soberly advising members of the graduating class to stay on and take post-graduate courses on the ground that they might as well do this as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">spend their time in the fruitless search for a position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps the most striking physical sign of the depression is the suspension of building. Huge new skyscrapers are now such rarities that the opening of one is a nine days’ wonder. Of those completed since 1929 at least half have gone through bankruptcy, and most of them are only 10- or 20-percent occupied. Automobile traffic has noticeably decreased; railway services have been cut repeatedly. In shops which a few years ago were thronged with customers a client is today greeted, as someone has said, “like a long-lost brother.” AH business, on the average, has declined between 30 and 40 percent, but in many lines the loss is far greater than this. In the building trade, for example, about 80 percent of the workers are at present unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The story of the Federal Government’s efforts to check the downward vicious spiral of deflation is a familiar one, and hardly needs to be repeated in detail. Mr. Hoover’s critics say of him that he never acts until it is almost too late, and then so half-heartedly that his efforts are robbed of all effectiveness; and certainly some recent events seem to give support to this view. He refused all last summer and autumn to call Congress into session, and now he has been excoriating its members for taking (as everyone knew they would do) a long time over fiscal legislation. For two years he opposed Federal appropriations for large-scale public works; now, when their effectiveness will admittedly be less than it would have been a year or more ago, he accepts the proposal. He insisted that there must be no appropriations from the Federal treasury for relief, and finally adopts the idea at a moment when the cities’ coffers are empty and starvation seems just round the corner. For at least six months before June, 1931, he was urged to propose a moratorium on war debts and reparations; and when he finally acted the Austrian banking system had all but collapsed, and the good effect of the plan was greatly reduced. He resisted for many months the suggestion that credit-inflation should be tried through the Federal Reserve system; when at last he adopted the plan things had grown so bad that this effort is now generally considered a failure and has been partially abandoned. It is hardly surprising that many Americans are asking whether the plan for a world conference on monetary stabilization (which has been urged upon the president for a long time from many sources) is not also belated and (with its omission of war debts and reparations) inadequate to the extent and severity of the crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Lightning </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By James Hunter (Scotland)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">L</span><span class="font5">IGHTNING is a flash produced by the discharge of electricity between two clouds, or between a cloud and the earth. We cannot say much more than this without having to traverse territory which has yet to be more fully explored, that is, “atmospheric electricity.” Lightning, then, is an electric explosion; but the question will persist, What causes it to explode? We know what is happening when a gun is discharged. It is an explosion of gunpowder, or other form of explosive, which when ignited is instantly converted into gas, which cannot be contained in the confined space of the breach of the gun. The result is an explosion. There is a big flash accompanied by a very loud report. The explosive material is there. We can see and handle it with perfect safety. We know exactly how it will behave under any set of conditions. It is our servant for various purposes, not our master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But who can master or control lightning? Who can tell when and where the next electrical discharge will take place? We know that it is an explosion, for we see the flash and hear the report; but what is it that explodes, electricity or what? In a small way we have learned how to control it by lightning conductors attached to high buildings; and if you live near a big dock area you will observe that a thunderstorm will ease off when crossing this area, because of the presence of an army of ships’ masts, each of which is protected by these conductors. This means that the electrical energy can be reduced by absorption in this way. The severity of a thunderstorm may be mitigated by facilities for running its energies into the sea or the earth itself, a process of drainage, so to speak. For this idea we are indebted to Benjamin Franklin, who in 1752 discovered the identity of electricity with lightning, and who turned his discovery to account by publishing his plan for defending houses from lightning by the use of pointed conductors. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">M.G.,</span><span class="font5"> page 204.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trolley of an electric tramcar sometimes emits a spark as it passes under the cross wire support &lt;&nbsp;of a live wire. This is lightning in miniature. A clear space must occur here between the sides of the trolley and the copper support plate. The electric current must jump this interval, and, as air is a nonconductor, the operation is accompanied by a spark and a “snap”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one has been able to tell even yet what electricity is, but all have studied its phenomena. Now the atmosphere for a certain distance above the earth has been proved to be almost continuously charged with electricity. Normally the electricity of the air is positive, and that of the surface of the earth is negative; and great variations in intensity take place every day. In storms the oscillations may be frequent and violent, and positive and negative may for a time change places. A forced meeting between these two phases of electricity in this nonconducting medium results in the electric spark or flash we call lightning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An observatory man was asked the other day, “How many different kinds of lightning are there?” And he has replied in the Press that “there are three different kinds: sheet, forked, and ribbon lightning”. Now that man is wrong; there are not three “different” kinds of lightning. There is just lightning, and that is always forked. What to me is a forked lightning, with its terrific report, is to you, at a distance from me, “sheet” lightning, with no report at all. “Ribbon” lightning is “forked” lightning magnified, giving the forked flash a broad ribbon effect to the observer at a distance. It is a horizontal view of a forked lightning, and indicates a highly humid state of the atmosphere. The moon on rising, viewed as it is through a denser atmosphere, always appears larger than when viewed later crossing the meridian. So with lightning, viewed through the same atmosphere, whose magnifying power is increased by the moisture present in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have said that the electric discharge which we call lightning may be “between” clouds; that is to say, its path will be a horizontal one, when no harm will be done, beyond what we call a thunder-plump. The thunder will be prolonged and of the rolling order usually. The length of the “roll” depends on the direction the horizontal flash took from the observer. In certain atmospheric conditions echoing effects are also possible. I have heard the echoes of a single report from a big gun rolling in from all parts, like the roll of thunder. This horizontal lightning is, of course, “forked,” and I would advise all airmen to give these clouds a wide berth when “gun practice” is on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have likewise said that the discharge may be from a cloud to the earth. That is to say, its direction is vertical. This zig-zagger is always the most dangerous fellow; for he is making to earth, and he gets there every time. This is the lightning that does all the damage, and when you see it about make tracks for safety without a moment’s delay. It may hit a tree, when Lord help any living thing under it. This summer over 300 dead birds were counted under a tree so struck. They had been sheltering on its branches. It may hit the flinty rock and reduce it to fragments. It may make a “shell hole” in an open field. It may enter the sea, killing every living thing within its radius. A blind man can tell a vertical forked lightning by its short, sharp, rickety-tick report, resembling different pieces of artillery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A young man this year persisted in finishing his round of golf when his companions had run for safety to a ditch (the safest place in the world with lightning), leaving all their clubs behind them. That young man’s round of golf remains unfinished still. His polished “cleek” proved too much for the lightning and himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Three men in a boat” went fishing in August last off Kinghorn. The storm came; all the other boats put in shore, and tardily these three young men resolved to do likewise, but they were too late. When one stood up to uplift the anchor he was struck dead, the lightning passing out through and making a hole in the bottom of the boat. In about a minute the lot were at the bottom of the sea. To be the highest object even in an open boat at sea is highly dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the same month of August a gentleman went fishing on one of our flooded rivers. He was fishing with bait, of course, and he appears to have been very successful. He was well protected from the inclement weather, so when the storm came he would not allow such a passing event to interrupt his success. He was not protected against lightning, however; so this gentleman’s fishing days “are all over now”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Cancer Hoax </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Norman Baker (Iowa)<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark142">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is no cancer found where fruit, vegetable and nature’s diet is followed. In countries like China, Japan, southern countries where the natives live on things of the garden and woods, cancer is an unknown thing save for a few<sup>r</sup> cases, and investigation of such will show them to be persons that deviated from nature’s foodstuffs and became more what we term “civilized” in food preparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Few indeed are the diseases that could exist in a pure blood stream, and we all should know the necessities for making pure blood. Fresh air, sunshine, exercise and pure foods from nature’s garden, and not out of a tin can. Violation of those things plus the use of aluminum ware has caused cancer to increase from the twentieth disease from the top in 1895 to the second from the top today, and it spares no one. General Hines of the War Veterans’ Bureau says that 400,000 soldier boys are doomed to die of cancer. The U. S. Health Department says in its bulletin of October 1,1931, that cancer increased 52^ percent from 1900 to 1920; that in 1929 cancer took 111,569, while heart disease took 245,000, placing cancer second on the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a man with a saw and hammer would hold himself out as a carpenter, able to build a house, and then admit he did not know what a house is we would immediately say he misrepresented, took money by false pretense. Still, recently, in a medical journal, an arm of that giant monster, the American Medical Association, permitted an article to be published entitled “What the Family Physician Should Know About Cancer”. In the first paragraph the writer bemoans the fact that the increasing mortality has been “climbing notwithstanding the fact that ‘more weapons have been piled up than were ever marshaled before, to be wielded against it, during all the history of medicine’&quot;. The writer said nothing about “too many” operations that have done more to raise the mortality than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The amazing thing, however, is the opening of the second paragraph, which says, “We do not know the cause of cancer.” How can one have the intestinal fortitude to write an article entitled “What the Family Physician Should Know About Cancer”, and then admit that “we do not know the cause of cancer”? If they do not know, and all their press articles say they do not, then how is it possible for them to formulate a treatment possessing any value as a preventive or curative measure? Is it not ridiculous on its face?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last February, in the Baker </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">vs.</span><span class="font5"> American Medical Association Federal Court case, Dr. Francis Carter Wood, of Columbia University, testified as a medical expert for the A. AL A., and on cross-examination he said: “In operations for stomach cancer, 96 percent die; the operation is usually successful, but the patient dies.” And all that from a medical witness, in the records of the court. But not a newspaper in America except the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Midivest Free Press</span><span class="font5"> ever published it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the same trial, Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood started off with his attorney to show his education. He mentioned being in Egypt, Germany and France, but on cross-examination admitted he could not speak the languages and “merely was visiting”, then started to condemn escha-rotics but afterwards admitted he had never had any experience with them, admitting he freely condemns without investigation, which is the reason that cancer research does not produce anything worth while at their hands, unless it may be a suggestion to further some treatment that enriches their bank accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an example of press suppression and the damage they do to cancer sufferers by suppressing facts of real cures, in the federal court case mentioned, as well as in the district court at Muscatine, Iowa, over fifty cured cancer patients took the stand and proved their cures, but the press said, “Several witnesses testified of being cured of minor ailments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hoax about cancer will end when the public realizes the fact that practically every disease known can be attributed to the fact that we have stepped aside from nature, ate the wrong things, poisoned our blood streams, and cancer resulted. It is a blood disease; and for proof we have only to follow the work of our surgeons who advocate surgery and look upon cancer as a local condition, when to cure cancer of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">finger they cut it off; cancer returns on the arm, they cut the arm off; it then returns on the limb, in many cases, and they cut that off, too; by that time the blood is so thoroughly “cancer poisoned” that the patient dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thousands can testify to that, having seen their dear ones pass to the great beyond after exactly that sort of suffering through the surgeon’s ignorance. Cancer is caused by a toxic condition, proved by the fact that in cancer of the rectum, history of the case shows constipation, and toxic conditions are caused by constipation, an unclean colon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To cure cancer we need not the libraries of our medical researchers or of the American Medical Association: pick up your Bible, turn to the twenty-ninth verse of the first chapter of Genesis, and we find that God, knowing how to care for us folks, says: “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.” The success of the cancer treatment at the Baker Hospital, Muscatine, Iowa, is based upon that advice, Nature’s diet and herb medications, a combination that has become the greatest thorn in the A. M. A. side. Solomon said: “Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise”; which can be amended thus: ‘Go to the beasts of the woods, the fowls of the air, the fish of the sea, and every moving, crawling thing; study their diet, their sanitation, and be wise, and in so doing cancer will pass from the earth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Diet and Dental Disease </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. J. Menzies Campbell (Glasgotv) </span><span class="font4">(Reprinted from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Spectator')</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">D</span><span class="font5">ENTAL disease is the most prevalent of modern complaints; it is more widespread today than ever before in the world’s history. The two most important types are caries (decay) and pyorrhoea alveolaris. The former affects the teeth themselves, and the latter the gums and the sockets into which the teeth are implanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These ailments were rarities amongst uncivilized tribes, the vast majority of whose dental troubles arose from an attrition (wearing away) of the teeth by the sand, which still remained in the cereals after stone-milling, also in imperfectly cleaned roots and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dental troubles became more common as nations became more civilized. For instance, the Egyptians were never so extensively affected as were the Greeks; and neither so greatly as the Romans. Also, one finds that the early Egyptians lived mainly on plain natural foods at a time when sugar and sugar-cane were unknown. As they became more civilized, their food became more luxurious and their dental troubles increased. The Greeks were a later and more advanced race; their food was highly refined, and they too suffered extensively from dental disease. Every student of history knows that feasting and Romans are synonymous terms; dental caries and pyorrhoea were rampant throughout the Roman Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Explorers tell us that those Eskimos who are untouched by modern civilization have perfect teeth; whereas those who live on the coast and partake of ‘civilized’ foods are constantly affected with dental disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the Napoleonic Wars, British soldiers were noted for their good teeth. During the Great War, British soldiers’ teeth were amongst the worst in the world. There is an explanation. The mothers of one hundred years ago not only breast-fed their babies, but fed themselves and their families on natural foods; whereas modern mothers have habitually eaten refined and denaturalized foods, and, in many instances, either could not or would not breast-feed their babies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To correlate the evidence: As each nation advanced in civilization, its people departed farther from the natural foods of their early ancestors ; concurrently, there was a marked increase in dental disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to realize that certain of the ancient physicians recognized a close affinity between diet and the state of the teeth. Hippocrates (born 460 B.C.) stated that the temporary teeth were formed from the nourishment supplied to the fetus in the womb and, after birth, by the mother’s milk; also that the permanent teeth were built from food and drink. Eighty years later Aristotle thought that teeth decayed because of sweet particles remaining between them; while Galen (born A.D. 131) believed that dental disease arose from disturbances in the complex function of nutrition. About that time, Pliny described a disease which conformed to the modern conception of pyorrhoea, and declared that it was due to the intemperate habits of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">History records facts. Today science is supplying the reasons. Generally speaking, the refining and cooking of foods reduce their vitamin content, mineral salts and roughage. These have a definite influence on the teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For a long time investigators were often led astray because they regarded teeth as separate entities and not as integral parts of a great body mechanism. They failed to recognize that, when one part degenerated, so did the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About fifty years ago, Dr. W. D. Miller, an American dentist practicing in Berlin, advanced the “chemico-parasitic” theory of dental disease. He thought that caries was the result of particles of food being left in the mouth, decomposing and producing an acid, which destroyed the teeth. Even Miller himself decided that his theory did not account for all dental disease. Like other observers, he knew many persons who, although they never used a toothbrush, yet possessed perfect teeth; and others who, despite frequent brushing of their teeth, were victims of regularly recurring dental caries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although Miller did </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> visualize the whole truth, his findings definitely influenced subsequent investigators, so that today it is possible to arrive at a just evaluation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Theobald Smith observed that pyorrhoea manifested itself in the early stages of experimental scurvy. It had already been recognized that scurvy was due to a diet deficient in fresh fruits and vegetables. Later, scientists found that vitamin C was the determining factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is impossible to detail here the names of the many research workers engaged in the study of diet in its relationship to the teeth. Suffice to say, Mrs. May Mellanhy, working under the aegis of the Medical Research Council, has proved that a child’s teeth can be affected for good or ill, according to the food eaten by the expectant and nursing mother and by the child. Also, that a tooth with even a poor foundation can be improved by an adequate diet; and, alternatively, a tooth with a good foundation may become defective, if the food be deficient in certain elements. Dr. Guttorm Toverud, of Oslo, has found that a proper diet will preserve an expectant mother’s teeth as well as prevent the onset of dental caries in her child. After over fifteen years of careful dietetic experiments on the higher apes, Professor Howe of Harvard has proved that decaying teeth are merely a sign of decaying health, and that a rational diet is the best preventive of both. Further, he has been able, by dietetic adjustments, to produce dental caries and pyorrhoea at will, and to cure them by a return to a normal diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The experiments of Drs. Bunting, Jay and Hard are particularly interesting and illuminating. With a rational diet, which contained no sugar, they were definitely able to control dental caries in groups of school children, despite the fact that decayed cavities did </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> increase in size, although left unfilled for a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Investigators naturally differ on many points (their experiments often being conducted under different conditions, with different types of animals and, in many cases, with different diets), but it may be said the majority-verdict is that dental caries and pyorrhoea are due to a diet deficient in vitamins, mineral salts and roughage. An additional factor is overindulgence in protein (meat, fish, &amp;c.) and cereals, two types of food resulting, after digestion, in what is known as an acid-ash base. If this be not neutralized by alkaline-ash base foods (fruits, vegetables, milk, &amp;c.), then the balance will be upset and calcium (lime) will be withdrawn from the teeth in Nature’s effort to maintain a proper equilibrium. Howe very strongly advocates restricting the acid-ash base foods, in order to insure healthy teeth and healthy bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dental caries is primarily a disease of youth. Although always indicative of imperfect general nutrition, yet symptoms of this latter, because of the effervescing vitality of youth, are often delayed till later life, when they appear as pyorrhoea, which is, generally speaking, a disease of middle-age; it is usually accompanied by constipation, rheumatism and other constitutional disturbances. For a long time it was believed that pyorrhoea caused these general conditions and that extraction of the teeth was the only cure. Many advanced thinkers are now convinced that all these conditions are merely symptoms of a general toxaemia (poisoning) arising from the eating of an excess of proteins and cereals and an insufficiency of vitamins, mineral salts and roughage, and that a rational diet is the best antidote. There is no permanent cure for pyorrhoea without a change in the dietary habits. The local symptoms will </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">apparently</span><span class="font5"> disappear after extraction of the teeth, but the basal causes will remain untouched. As proof of this, there will continue to be an abnormal, yet progressive, absorption of the bony ridges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is important that a due proportion of hard foods should be eaten and well chewed. In this way both the teeth and the gums are exercised and the increased circulation of the blood acts as a barrier to disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Critics often declare that, although our early ancestors were practically immune from dental disease, they were ignorant of vitamins, mineral salts and roughage. This statement is undoubtedly true, but such critics fail to realize that ancient man did not require this knowledge; he could choose only those foods which were natural and unrefined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Denta] caries and pyorrhoea would become diseases of the past if everyone, and especially expectant and nursing mothers, ate sufficient uncooked and properly cooked vegetables, raw fruit, fresh milk, eggs, butter, cheese, honey, dates and raisins and reduced the intake of meat, cereals and refined sugar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">N AN article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The New Republic</span><span class="font5"> Bruce Blivens shows that on June 30,1932, the total market value of the common stock of forty-four of the greatest American companies, including Allied Chemical and Dye Corporation, Telephone Trust, General Electric, General Motors, International Harvester, Bethlehem Steel, Standard Oil of New Jersey, Steel Trust, General Foods, and United Fruit Company, amounted to less than $5,500,000,000 and that control of all these greatest of American companies could probably be obtained for less than the Government has already put into the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Blivens thinks that as Big Business has totally and completely fallen down on the job, the best thing the people as a whole could do is to take over their enterprises at the going market price; but neither he nor we have the least idea that our representatives at Washington will ever do anything as sensible as that. They do not want the people to own anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meantime the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is loading up with the frozen assets of such railroads as the Wabash and the Nickel Plate and in due time the people are going to own a lot of railroads that neither they nor anybody else can operate at a profit. How eager our Big Business geniuses are to exchange their water-logged old railway securities that nobody wants at any price for millions in good hard cash. They will not be as eager to give up the fat pickings of the Telephone Trust.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in Central India </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By G. B. Gar rar A</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is a certain house car touring in different parts of India. It had traveled some few thousand miles since its initial trip in last October. This is a closed-in car, and its body is painted gray; on both sides of the body boldly stand the words “Jehovah’s witnesses”, with the monogram “J. w.” in between the two words. Two of these witnesses have carried on a pioneer work of bearing the testimony of Jesus Christ to many people in several districts and states in India (including some of the Central Provinces) in this car. Bilaspur is a district in the said provinces. Bilaspur is the chief town or headquarters of the district of Bilaspur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Bilaspur there is a clergyman of the Church of England. These folks are known as “padres” in India. This padre is Mr. Earle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is also a gentleman, Mr. Sebastian by name, a humble but bold and active Christian, endeavoring to pass on the testimony of Jesus Christ to his neighbors, and place literature in their hands to this effect, which points out the evidence relative to the good news of the establishment of Jehovah God’s kingdom on this earth. By His government or kingdom the people will get peace, prosperity, life, happiness, etc. In these circumstances the people will be enjoying the blessings at the hand of Jehovah God, their Creator. Clearly it •will be seen that He is their friend and benefactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Earle does not want the people to know these things. He does not believe in Jehovah of the Jews; he would condemn such a God, despite the fact that Christ (whom he professes to follow) was a Jew and worshiped Jehovah. Millions of people are in doubt, and wonder why God is allowing such terrible conditions to exist. They find it hard to reconcile their conception of the God of the Old Testament with their understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and desire enlightenment on the subject. Jehovah’s witnesses pass on printed matter explaining these things. It seems particularly mean and wicked for anybody, especially a so-called “servant of God”, to wish to hinder Jehovah’s witnesses from submitting testimony which would vindicate Jehovah’s name and word, inasmuch as such testimony bears witness to God’s purposes and His kingdom which will completely bring about </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His own</span><span class="font5"> vindication of His word, name and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In due time, the aforementioned car came to Bilaspur. By arrangement and kind permission of those in charge, a lantern lecture was given in a local Railway Institute by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This must have perturbed Mr. Earle; for he sent round the railway colony, by a servant from house to house, a notice which reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Witness of Jehovah” Van is in the Station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a definite attempt to undermine the work of the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unwary are deceived, and their faith is unsettled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Faith is shaken and nothing placed in its stead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Sebastian, who is mainly responsible in Bilaspur for this Old Testament religion, is not a member of the Church of England or India. By associating himself with “Jehovah’s witness” he has </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ipso facto </span><span class="font5">excommunicated himself from the Anglican Church, and cannot receive its sacraments or expect Christian burial from any of its ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question to ask the “Jehovah witness” people who call on you is,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“do</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> YOU BELIEVE CHRIST IS GOD?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Their answer will have to be, “No.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You can then say, “You are not Christians; I can have nothing to do with you as far as helping you with your religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By giving them money and buying their books, you are helping them to undermine the work of the church in Bilaspur, and elsewhere, and helping to propagate their doctrine, which is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font5"> Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was signed by Mr. Earle as “Chaplain”, and dated “11/7/32”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anyhow, poor Sebastian did not seem heartbroken. He chuckled heartily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How many Church of England (or other) padres and clergymen went to France during the War to perform burial services for the poor men who died there, in many cases victims of the “Church’s” and others’ lies? Men were urged to go by these false and lying hypocrites who place their sanctimonious, smug and deceitful devices at their father’s feet for service. See John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer (who, by the way, “excommunicated” himself from the Church of England long ago) called on Mr. Earle afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The suggestion is here submitted that Mr. Earle was using Mr. Sebastian as an example to intimidate anybody who might take the books or listen to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As events proved, it was not a bad advertisement. The remaining people whom we had to call upon, as a whole, wanted to see the books referred to, and contributed for them, too. After giving the testimony it was quite refreshing to say that they were the books Mr. Earle had warned them not to read; in one case, where a householder had not seen the notice and was disgusted with the padre’s action, the witness obligingly went to the car to show her a copy. The wrath of man shall turn to the praise of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">People are losing their fear of these clergy. As you sometimes publish similar naughty outbursts by these children (again John 8:44, please), perhaps this one might interest you, with above-mentioned particulars. It would help the poor gentleman to have a wider scope for publicity, and his desire to identify his opposition to Jehovah satisfied. Likewise it shows his fear of people’s reading about Jehovah and His glorious kingdom. It also shows another method whereby the clergy can intimidate their church members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the latter, should you publish any of this, a comment of interest is submitted, viz.: Earle belongs to a system of the Devil which is anti-God and anti-Kingdom. God’s purpose is to destroy all the wicked. The system of which he is a part is going to be destroyed. Jehovah’s witnesses, in the main, it seems, will live beyond the battle of Armageddon, in which this destruction generally will take place. At the complete destruction of God’s enemies “the slain of the Lord [Jehovah] shall be . . . from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried”. (Jer. 25: 33) Ending this Biblical prophecy with these words, then, a question is asked, to wit: Is there not a possibility that not only would Mr. Sebastian </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font5">require Mr. Earle’s services after all, but, also, Mr. Earle and his colleagues would be hard to find if required?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>A Curious Kind of “A Patriotic Citizen”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">T IS a curious kind of “A Patriotic Citizen” that does not wish his fellow men to have instruction or to have hope, in a time when they never needed instruction so badly, and when they are almost in despair. But Columbus, Ohio, has such a person. Perhaps we should have said Columbus has such a man, but any real man would have the courage to at least sign his own name to his own letter, and so we hesitate to say that the writer of the following, which appeared in the Columbus </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch</span><span class="font5"> of October 19, 1932, is a man. The most that we can say of him is that he is probably a clergyman, as may be inferred from the first sentence of the second paragraph of his letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EX-JUDGE RUTHERFORD CRITICIZED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the Editor of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sir: It seems to me that the thinking public must have been surprised by Judge Rutherford’s advertisement in Sunday’s paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This man speaks slightingly of the American government, as well as of the clergy. Anyone who tries to undermine the faith of the people in their government and in their church is surely on the order of a communist. What good does he derive from denouncing those two foundations of life, and influencing young people and the ignorant ? Does he want to try out Russia’s policy of overthrowing the government, and blaspheming and abolishing the church? Why is he given so much time on the radio? Are Americans asleep to let such things persist ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is hiding behind scripture verses, using them as a smoke-screen to put across his wild fancies. If our government were overthrown by communists what would our poor little hundreds of dollars of savings in government bonds be worth? Those dollars which so many of the middle class are saving for a rainy day, or old age, thinking they are safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is certainly time for plain speaking on the part of sensible people, who are not in favor of “soap box orators” who only tear down, and do nothing to build up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Oct. 14, 1932. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Patriotic Citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we look back to Jesus’ day we find Annas and Caiaphas, and their entire bunch of priests and hypocrites, loudly clamoring for His death and saying, ‘This man speaks slightingly of the Roman government, as well as of the clergy.’ Is it any worse for one of Jesus’ followers to tell about the true and righteous government that is coming than it was for Jesus to do it? When the Devil took Jesus up into a high mountain and showed Him all the governments of the world in a moment of time, did he merely show Him the Roman government? When he told Jesus that the power and glory of all these governments belonged to him, was he merely limiting himself to the one that then bore sway over Palestine, or did he also have reference to the aggregation that gathered at the (dis)Armament Conference at Geneva, and after six months could not even make a start toward abandoning their weapons of murder? And Uncle Sam was at Geneva, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why hypocritically say, “Anyone who tries to undermine the faith of the people in their government and in their church is surely on the order of a communist”? George Washington, in the years from 1776 to 1781 tried his very best to undermine the faith of the people in their government, the British government, and succeeded, too. But did that make him a “communist” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A Patriotic Citizen” does not specify of what particular one of the 200 denominations he is a clergyman, but there is only one chance in 200 that he is a Roman Catholic. Very evidently, therefore, either he or his forebears tried their very best to undermine the faith of the people in their church, the Roman Catholic church, for in the Dark Ages that was the only one permitted to function. Did that make them communists ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trouble with Mr. Patriotic Citizen is that he is depressed by what happened in Russia when the common people found out about those “cotton saints” and deserted the Orthodox church en masse. The priests had been preying upon their credulity and got caught in the act. The bodies of the saints, so carefully kept in their cathedrals, were not bodies at all. They were merely nicely-made rolls of cotton. He is afraid that something like that will happen to his own “church” when the common people find out how badly they have been taken in. But why should he jump to the conclusion that because the Russian people went Bolshevik when they learned the truth about their hypocrites, the American people must necessarily do the same ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effort to tar Judge Rutherford with the communist or Bolshevik stick is all buncombe, as every person who has read even one of his 130,000,000 books now in circulation knows very Well, and as the millions of people who are weekly listening to his radio talks also know very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch</span><span class="font5"> wants to know what good Judge Rutherford derives from denouncing the hypocrites in church and state. The answer is that he gets a lot of good from it. When Jesus told the scribes and Pharisees that wanted to murder Him, “Ye are of your father the devil,” He got the biggest kind of kick out of it, and so does the judge when he tells the same class today the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take a look at the twenty-third chapter of Matthew. Could any man say such things as Jesus there said about the clergy of His own day, and die for it, as He did shortly afterwards, without absolutely reveling in what He was doing? He did what He did because it was the will of Jehovah God. And that is why Judge Rutherford so often tells the clergy to their face just what they are and why the world is in its present condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford has urged the clergy of the United States to get together and name a representative to debate with him over the radio the broad question that the clergy of the world today are the Devil’s clergy and that their churches are the Devil’s churches, and he has offered to pay half the bill of the big hookup if those that name his opponent will pay the other half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How silly, therefore, for any man to write and inquire, “Why is he given so much time on the radio?” He pays for it, or, at any rate, his friends do, and millions of the people want to hear his talks. There is nothing to hinder “A Patriotic Citizen” from giving radio talks, if he is willing to pay for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But who would want to hear him? Nobody! Who wants to hear what any man has to say who would hint at a desire to strangle free speech in a land that was built for free speech, and that rests upon it ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If we should ask this clergyman that has signed himself “A Patriotic Citizen” just what kind of patriot he is, and should cross-question him, we should find that he is the kind that wanted millions of his fellow men murdered during the World War so that Morgan could be sure of the interest on his French bonds and the world could be made safe for hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should find that he undoubtedly approved every official act of a cabinet which contained a Daugherty, a Fall, a Mellon, a Denby, and a Hoover, and was presided over by a Harding, with Jess Smith, Harry Sinclair and Doheny in the offing. His wrath would be upon those that would bring to light the Teapot Dome, Alien Custodian, Veterans’ Bureau, or any other</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mare’s nest that would show the people just how rotten everything in the Devil’s world really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We should doubtless learn that in a time of national need unparalleled he was opposed to the use of Red Cross funds to feed the starving who are guilty of the vast ‘crime’ of unemployment in a land loaded to the skies with every good thing, and that he gloated with joy at the clever way in which Charles G. Dawes grabbed for his one bank one-fourth as much money as was set aside for direct relief of the families of 11,000,000 unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He asks, “Are Americans asleep?” and the self-evident fact is that they are, and have been, while everything in the country was packed into the black satchels of the crooks of high finance. If this is Christ’s kingdom, pray, where is the Devil’s kingdom which “A Patriotic Citizen” is so eager to defend? Does he not know that if Jesus Christ were to present himself at Ellis Island tomorrow He could not get into this country at all, because He would be unwilling to murder His fellow man at the behest of the Big Business crowd that dominates the country?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford’s critic says that “he is hiding behind scripture verses”, as if that were an evil thing. Well, behind what kind of smokescreen is this disguised clergyman hiding? Certainly not the Scriptures. He admits that what he is afraid of is that the telling of the plain, unvarnished truth may unfavorably affect his pickings and savings. Suppose it does? Which is more important, that the people should be told the great truth that God’s kingdom is at hand to remove at a stroke their oppressors, and to grant them liberty and peace and life and happiness, or that somebody should hang on temporarily to a few cents of the mammon of unrighteousness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meantime, a great reconstruction work is under way in which it is to be feared this misnamed “Patriotic Citizen” will have neither part nor lot, because he has cast in his portion with the hypocrites.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>Another Judgment at Rockville</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">N JANUARY, 1932, two of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested at Rockville, Connecticut. At the trial in April District Attorney Noone made a vicious attack upon them, stating that he intended to put an end to what he called “this Jehovah business” in Rockville. He was stricken with apoplexy on leaving the courtroom, and died within five months. On the day of his funeral more than a hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses, without prearranging so to do, covered the town with the message now due. On that occasion effort was made to serve the chief of police, Stephen J. Tobin, with a notice regarding the work and a list of the workers. He became enraged. refused to receive the notice, and shouted, “I will have nothing to do with Jehovah.” On the tenth day thereafter he died in bed of a heart attack. The account says, “He had apparently been in good health, and had retired for the night when stricken.” Like Mr. Noone, we are told, he was a communicant of St. Bernard’s Catholic church. Looks as if, should any more members of that church that are in official positions in the city of Rockville be brought in contact with present truth, it might be a good idea for them, for their own safety, to remain quiet when Jehovah’s name is mentioned. However, that is for each of them to decide. Alean-time, the work goes on. Those who heed may live; those who refuse to heed will eventually and certainly go the way of Mr. Noone and Mr. Tobin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font5">AVING such a relief for callous spots on the bottom of the feet I want to pass it on to others. Buy a rubber bath sponge, which costs ten cents at the five and ten cent stores. With scissors cut a pad of the sponge to fit under the callous, and wear it inside the stocking, which holds it in place. It surely protects the foot from the painful burning; at least I have found it to do so. It is also good for corns or bunions. Of course, the sponge should be cut to fit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>Jehovah the Provider for the People</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font5">T BECOMES more and more plain every day that man cannot provide for himself, nor for his fellow man. Today the world is overrun by millions of men who want to use time and strength to provide what few necessities they require before they die, but who are unable to find employment. The governments of the various countries claim to be making efforts to provide jobs and financial help for the unemployed and the poverty-stricken. Economic experts and influential men try to calm the people’s fears with the assurance that somehow or other the genius of man or newer conditions will straighten matters out, and all will be able to provide honestly for themselves, and prosperity, peace and contentment will hold sway again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strong men and accomplished women, with good work today, may shrug their shoulders, feeling that they are well taking care of themselves and are fully able to do so without dependence upon God. So also many crippled, or invalid, or aged people today thought of themselves in brighter days. Many others, with stocks, bonds, sums of money in bank or other properties, may also take an indifferent attitude toward God, feeling themselves well provided for. Thousands of people were in that attitude before the notorious Wall Street crash came and before banks throughout the country subsequently failed or closed their doors. But the only ones who really seem to be providing for themselves are the financial giants who today are building higher and higher gold piles for themselves. To such, however, the parable of Jesus now applies; it reads: “The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits’ And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool! this night thy soul [that is, thy life] shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”—Luke 12:16-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tell some people today that the Creator, Jehovah God, is the great provider for the people, and they will ask: Then why does not God </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">provide</span><span class="font5"> and stop the people’s hardships and woes? To this complaint the answer must be given that the people have never given themselves in faith and obedience to God, thereby to prove God that He can and will provide. Furthermore, even right now they are more indebted to God for His provision than they may think. When Adam was put out of the garden of Eden for his selfish action against God’s law, God left Adam in a certain measure to provide some things for himself, saying: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground.” God could justly have put Adam and his wife Eve to death instantly (which would have meant that none of us would ever have come into existence), but God permitted them to exist for many years and to bring forth children before they died, and hence Adam had Jehovah God to thank for his existence at all. He had God to thank for providing this earth and a place on it, yes, even outside the garden of Eden, as a home for him. He had God to thank for the ground which he might till to make it productive; and also for the things to eat which God had planted in the ground and in the waters before Adam was made. He had God to thank for sunshine, air, and moisture, which plant, animal, and man require. And all of us today, whether wealthy or poor, whether well or sick, have the same God to thank for those same things. If we are yet able to work and earn something to keep ourselves clothed and fed and sheltered in a home, we have God to thank for our bodies, strength and faculties which we can employ at work. It is the foolish, thoughtless, self-conceited and ungrateful man who thinks that he is not at all dependent upon the providence of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember the words of Jesus, who said of Jehovah God: “He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matt. 5:45) The Apostle Paul also tells how the nations have all along ignored the true God and served Satan and his systems, but how God has mercifully refrained from wiping faithless and disobedient man out of existence. Paul remarks that God “in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness”. (Acts</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">14:16,17) Every honest-minded person will have to admit that this does not sound as if Jehovah God had evil designs against man in the future after man’s death. And yet great church systems of the world teach that God has provided a fearful place to torture sinful man in literal fire and brimstone forever. Such teaching does not harmonize with the teachings of the inspired Holy Scriptures, nor with the great Bible truth that “God is love”. Jehovah’s matchless love for mankind is shown in the provision He has made for their everlasting future in complete happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All men, except the depraved, desire perpetual life in eternal youth and happiness. The medical doctors and others are very loud in claiming to provide for the health and lengthening of the lives of the people. But gruesome diseases continue to increase and spread, and though the average life of the babies may have been increased because of more favorable conditions today, yet the death rate of those past the age of fifty has increased. Also, the war experts are providing more and more deadly implements and machines and chemical and bacterial inventions which threaten the lives of every man, woman and child in “Christendom”. What can the poor people do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In their great hunger for real enjoyable life somewhere the people imagine that when they die their personality goes on existing in another realm, an unseen world. Their church teachers have put this heathenish idea into their minds. All this is a vain hope. For God’s sacred Word teaches that man dies because of sin, and that man really dies; that he does not merely seem to die, but that he positively goes into total nonexistence. That is why the Bible also teaches, not the immortality of the human soul, but the resurrection of the human dead. In Ezekiel’s prophecy, chapter eighteen, verse four, God declares man’s nonexistence after death, saying: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” For this very reason God advises all mankind not to put their confidence in their government officials, their doctors, their scientists, and their church leaders to provide eternal life for man. God’s Word, Psalm one hundred forty-six, verses three to six, says: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth [at death], he returneth to his earth [not to heaven]; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God: which made heaven, and earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who then can provide never-ending life for the people, and that life where the people want it, right here on this earth? Only God, who in the beginning gave life to our first parents. It is not God’s fault that Adam is not alive today and that all his offspring have gone into death and we face death also. The life God provided to Adam was perfect, free from all sickness, and capable of being enjoyed in perpetual youth in Paradise down here on the earth. It was Adam’s breaking of God’s sacred law that caused God justly to place a limit on Adam’s existence. And we, Adam’s children, have Adam to ‘thank’ for our sinful, imperfect, diseased, and dying condition. Rather than hold God responsible for this undesirable and disagreeable condition, we should thank Him that He has permitted us to enjoy a measure of existence in spite of our debased condition. But now we ask, Will God find a way whereby He can meet the penalty placed upon sin and again provide life for the undone family of our father Adam?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s loving Word answers, Yes! Thousands of years ago God caused a prophet of His, named Abraham, to utter these undying words: “God will provide himself a lamb.” Two thousand years after this prophecy, and nineteen hundred years ago, God did provide the Lamb through whom all the nations of the earth are to be blessed. (Gen. 22: 8,18) It is Jesus, whom the inspired prophet John the Baptist called “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”. (John 1: 29) Concerning one part of Jesus’ mission in being born into this world as a man, Jesus said: “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.” (John 10:10,11) Hence it is written concerning God’s provision for mankind: “The gift of God is eternal life, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">through</span><span class="font5"> Jesus Christ our Lord.” —Rom. 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today, as also for thousands of years past, the people are suffering from bad politics. Satan the adversary is the great politician responsible for all such politics, for Jesus has pointed out to us that Satan, who is the Devil, is “the prince of this world”. Now what the people want (even though they do not express it that way) is deliverance from this wicked Politician of politicians. They want a government that cannot be bribed or corrupted, that is strong enough not to knuckle down to the bossism of greedy men of wealth; a government that actually governs “for the glory of God” and for the blessing of mankind with life in perfect health, true liberty, security and peace, and innocent joy and happiness. They want a perfect ruler, able to destroy the Devil and his organization, and strong enough to rule for the establishment of righteousness, truth and godliness for ever. And today the people want this more than ever previously, but they do not turn to Jehovah to provide this. No, you still see them electing men as their rulers; you still see the religious heads, even those claiming to be Christian, flinging themselves fanatically into politics; you still see ambitious men grab hold of places of chief power in the nations and establish themselves as dictators and force their imperfect, lopsided, conceited views on the people at large. The people of “Christendom” pray weekly, “Our Father which art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come”; and yet they show they do not believe in what they are asking for in this prayer from Jesus’ lips. For the people do not do as Jesus taught: they do not ‘seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness’, believing that all other things they need God will faithfully provide.—Matt. 6: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If God were to wait for the people to be ‘converted to Him’ (as church people call it), God would never be establishing His kingdom over mankind. Thank God He did not wait for mankind to be converted to Him before He sent Jesus to be born and to die for our race. It is written: “While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.” (Rom. 5:8,6) Neither will God wait for the churches to try to finish their self-imposed but unscriptural job of converting the world, before He sets up His kingdom over mankind. God has already provided the capable and only fit ruler, and that is Jesus Christ. God did not wait for the conversion of the world before He provided His holy Word, which promises this faultless and all-powerful government to mankind. It was over eighteen hundred years ago that God had His holy Bible completed, and thereby finished giving the last of His promises and prophecies regarding the sure coming of that flawless and all-necessary kingdom. Whereas both devil and man have failed to give the people such a government and its benefits, God is fully able to supply such a government. Nothing that devil or man can do will prevent Jehovah God from taking away the present burdensome, unsuccessful ruling powers under Satan, and giving the people a divine, righteous ruling power. Many centuries ago God gave His word to provide it; now in our days He will maintain His own integrity and fulfil His word. “The last days” of Satan’s activities and systems are here. The “perilous times” are come. This is the time at which, God gave promise, He will fulfil His Word. His kingdom is here. Through it Jehovah God will provide life even for those buried in the graves, and will provide the living with all that they will ever need throughout their eternal life on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Tithing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By F. W. Gibson</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is no scripture in the New Testament to prove the tithing system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tithing was given to the Jews only, through the law; not to the Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law was nailed to the tree with Jesus. —Col. 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The law and the prophets were until John the Baptist.—Luke 16:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.”—Gal. 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pharisees pictured the clergy of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—1 Cor. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus always reproved the Pharisees in their forcing tithes. (Luke 18:11-14; Matt. 23:23; Luke 11:42) They should have preached the love of God and looked after judgment; but, instead, they were looking after theii' own selfish gain, just as the clergy of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul never took anything from any of the churches for his services by asking for it as do the clergy of our day. (1 Cor. 9:14,15) In 1 Corinthians 9:18 he states: “What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.” Paul had no certain dwelling place, and was hungry, thirsty and naked, and he worked with his hands to provide things for himself; and he applied these conditions to all the apostles. (1 Cor. 4: 9-12) The clergy of today do not preach the gospel, and that is the reason they refuse to undergo the hardships as the apostles did. Jesus said they (the clergy) want the best and easy places. —Matt. 23:4-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul coveted no man’s silver or gold; and he worked to support himself.—Acts 20: 33-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul was a tent-maker, and not a collector of tithes.—Acts 18: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peter states that one should not preach for money.—1 Pet. 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul tells us that if any man would not work neither should he eat.—2 Thess. 3:8-10; 1 Thess. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul states that wages for preaching is the same as robbery; and then the wages which he accepted was not used for himself, but was used to help the church at Corinth. Paul was burdensome to no church.—2 Cor. 11: 7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The tithing system is burdensome to the poor and honest people of the church systems.—Matt. 23:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy teach things which they should not, and that for filthy lucre’s sake. (Titus 1:11) The tithing is only for the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah, the most high God, tells us that the preachers are ignorant, lazy, greedy, and can never have enough.—Isa. 56:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the clergy were comforting the people and telling them the truth, the people would freely give without being tithers.</span></p>
