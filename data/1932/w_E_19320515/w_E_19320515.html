<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization, and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 6</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Ascribe ye strength unto God; over Israel is his majesty, and his strength in the skies.’’—Ps. 68: 34, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH is the Almighty, the Most High, and the Giver of every thing that is good. This great truth all who get life must come to know, believe and fully accept. The rebellious ones will be compelled to receive notice of this great truth, and, they refusing to hear and give heed thereto, the responsibility will be upon their own heads. Now is the time when the remnant who are the witnesses of Jehovah must publish these great truths in order that they may meet their obligation toward Jehovah and maintain their integrity toward him. Therefore the psalmist addresses God’s “faithful servant” class in this Psalm (68:28), which reads: “Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, 0 God, that which thou hast wrought for us. ’ ’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah has commandeered all the strength of his “servant” class at this time, hence such must love him with all their strength; but such is not the main point expressed by the psalmist in this verse. According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> the text reads: “The strength, 0 God, which thou hast wrought for’us.” This shows that all credit for the truth and for what work has been done to make the truth known to others, and that all that has been accomplished and that is yet to be accomplished, must be ascribed to Jehovah God, and not to any creature. This matter is emphasized time and again in the Scriptures, thus showing its importance and the great necessity for God’s anointed people to take heed thereto and deport themselves accordingly. It is written: “For thou also hast wrought all our works in us.” (Isa. 26:12) Those who have responded to the call to the kingdom, and who have been favored with a knowledge of the kingdom and who then exercise common sense, will refrain from giving credit to men for the truth and the work done in connection therewith; and if such are truly and fully devoted to God they will give to Jehovah God all credit and honor for the truth and what it has accomplished. “And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.” (Ps. 90:17) All such will have the proper appreciation of the words of Jesus, who declared that the exaltation of men in the sight of Jehovah God is an abomination to the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> That which God wrought for Israel in David’s day was the kingdom which he brought out of the tribe of Judah; and he set David upon God’s throne on his holy hill in Zion, represented by the presence of the ark of the covenant there. (1 Chron. 14:2; 16:1) That which ‘God hath wrought for us’, his anointed people in this present day, is ‘the birth of the man-child , the kingdom, the setting of his King upon his holy hill in Zion, and the interest of which kingdom, represented by “his goods”, the King, the Lord Jesus, since coming to his temple, has committed into the hands of his “faithful and wise servant”. The “servant” class must be strengthened and must go forward in the strength of the Lord and in the power of his might. Therefore the remnant prays, in the language of the Psalm, for the increase of the kingdom and interest thereof on the earth; and Jehovah gives strength to them, as it is written: “Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”— Isa. 9:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> “Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.” (Vs. 29) While the tabernacle of the Lord remained at Gibcon the priests of Israel offered sacrifice there. (1 Chron. 16:39-42) At the time this Psalm-Song (68) was composed and sung, the ark of the covenant was in the tent on Mount Zion at Jerusalem, where David had caused it to be installed. This suggests that, as far as Zion is concerned, the real temple of God was not set up until 1918, when the Lord Jesus came and the faithful sleeping saints were raised and brought into Zion, and the faithful ones remaining on the earth were also brought into the temple. From that time forward the praises of Jehovah must begin and must be sung throughout the nations even within the hearing of the present rulers of the earth. Such is the reason why the vigorous witness work began after 1918, and particularly from 1922 forward.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Who, then, are the “kings [that] bring presents unto thee’’, as stated in this twenty-ninth verse of the Psalm ? Surely not the kings of Satan's organization, because they do nothing of the kind. The words of the Psalm, therefore, must refer to the remnant, anointed to the kingdom with Christ Jesus. This conclusion is supported by Revelation 21: 24, to wit: “And the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.” Members of the faithful remnant class are in the covenant for the kingdom and are now bringing presents unto the Lord, in this, that they present themselves living sacrifices to bring honor and praise to the name and to the kingdom of the Most High. No other kind of presents could be brought into the temple. “Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth [satanic earth].”—Ps. 76:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> God’s people have long been persecuted, scattered and peeled, and now we are in that time or day which the Lord has made for his own and he has brought them into his place of safety. “In that time shall the present be brought unto the Lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion. ’ ’—Isa. 18: 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REBUKE THE WILD BEASTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> rendering of verse thirty of the Psalm appears to be faulty. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font3"> is a better rendering of the text. “Rebuke thou the beast of the reeds, the herd of mighty oxen among the calves of the peoples; trampling in mire the favoured ones, refined as silver; scatter thou the peoples who in war take delight.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup>‘The wild beasts of the reeds’ evidently refers to Satan’s organization, pictured by the “dragon” of the Nile river in Egypt. (See Ezekiel 29:3.) These ‘beasts’ particularly represent the commercial-military wing of Satan’s organization which juggle with the finances of the nations of the earth, attempting to maintain a gold standard that they might more easily control the commerce and keep the people in subjection. This same wicked crowd and their allies would destroy God’s anointed people, if the Lord did not shield and protect them. These “wild beasts” represent Satan putting forth his efforts to prevent the publication of the name and kingdom message of Jehovah. “And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, 0 Satan: even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?”—Zech. 3:1,2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Here the Lord is called upon to rebuke Satan. Jehovah did rebuke this crowd of “beasts” when he brought his faithful ones under the robe of righteousness and thus showed his approval of them. Jehovah’s mighty hand of protection is over his remnant while they utter the words he has placed in their mouths. (Isa. 51:16) This is another rebuke to the “wild beasts”. The worst rebuke to them, however, will be administered at Armageddon, when their rebuke will be lasting. The text mentions “the multitude of the bulls”. These are like the bulls of Bashan and represent the oppressive and wicked organization of Satan which the Lord will destroy and concerning which the prophet writes: “For the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea. And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.” (Isa. 34:6,7) These bulls have persecuted God’s anointed people and attempted to destroy them. In harmony with this it is written: “Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.” (Ps. 22:12) These bulls, however, soon shall bite the dust.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Further the language of verse thirty is: “The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> renders these last words “among the calves of the peoples ’ ’; and this seems to be more particularly in harmony with the facts. The mighty ones of Satan's organization push, crowd and horn the common people, who are here likened unto calves amongst the arrogant bulls. The common people are now dreadfully oppressed, half-starved, and shuddering with cold; but they must hear the message concerning God's kingdom, which is their only hope. They must be told that after Armageddon the common people need no longer fear the bulls, because then there will be no bulls to do the horning and pushing. Those who now hear the message of the Lord, and who take their stand on the side of Jehovah, may have hope and grow up to be fat, sleek calves, well groomed, as God’s prophet expresses it: “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings: and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.” (Mal. 4:2) Stall calves are kept clean; therefore this indicates that the peoples of the earth must clean themselves up, put themselves fully on the side of the Lord, and prepare for the “highway” leading into his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The words of the Psalm ‘ ‘ trampling under foot the pieces of silver” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> also refer to Satan’s organization and to the higher ones therein. They have no consideration or appreciation of the value such as silver represents in the Scriptures. Literally, they trampled silver under foot when they adopted the single gold standard, and now they are beginning to reap some of the results of their selfish act. In the Scriptures silver symbolizes or represents divine words of truth. The strong-headed bulls do not value these truths as anything, but, on the contrary, they arrogantly stamp them in the mire with their feet. In recent days the Word of the Lord concerning Jehovah and his kingdom has been presented to many of these bulls, particularly the clergy, as well as other bulls of Satan’s organization, and many of these “bull-headed” ones have stamped the truth literally under their feet. Like swine they have trampled under their feet the precious things of the Lord and then turned to rend Jehovah’s witnesses. (Matt. 7: 6) While it would have been out of place before the coming of the Lord to his temple for any of the followers of Christ Jesus to cast the truth before these “swine”, as it is now done, yet now is the day of the judgment of God. Christ is at his temple for judgment, and God has commanded that these “bulls” and “swine” must be served with notice of his purpose to rid the earth of them.—Isa. 61:2; Ezek. 3:4,11.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> The words of the subtitle above quoted are the latter part of the thirtieth verse of the Psalm and also refer to members of Satan’s organization. They do not mean, however, the war that arises between nations, but war that Satan's organization makes upon Zion, which is Jehovah’s organization, and the members of which yet on earth are commanded to make publication of the name of Jehovah. Satan is directing this warfare for the purpose of destroying God’s remnant. (Rev. 12:17) Those who “delight in war” must of necessity include “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” the “evil servant” class, which by innuendo, deceit and misrepresentation and lies continue to assault the remnant. Their speech is soft, and their words oily, but deceit is in their hearts; and, like the padded foot of the tiger cat, they rub softly their victim until the opportunity comes to scratch and rend. ‘ ‘ The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.” (Ps. 55:21) This crowd of the enemy is anti-God, anti-kingdom, anti-Christ, and therefore against the remnant of God, and are a part of Satan's organization which God will destroy. Especially is the working of the “man of sin” like unto his father Satan’s, who employs fraud and deceit and openly claims to be for God and God’s people and vehemently denies that such are in a conspiracy against God’s people, yet carrying forward their work to hinder that which the Lord is doing with his anointed on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SEEKING ZION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> The psalmist then describes the class of people that come out of the world of which Egypt was a type. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font3"> of verse thirty-one reads: “Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. ” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham, </span><span class="font3">instead of using the word “princes”, says “high messengers”. The word must refe'r to some people that have been of the world but have come out of it, a people that have been subjected to Satan's organization but do not form an official part of it. The Lord caused the Prophet Isaiah to write concerning this class of people who will be subject to the rulers in Satan’s organization but who after Armageddon will be seeking to come unto Jehovah and join themselves to his organization; thus the prophet wrote: “And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. And the Lord shall smite Egypt; he shall smite and heal it; and they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be entreated of them, and shall heal them. In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria; and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall serve [the Lord] with the Assyrians . . . ; whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.”— Isa. 19:21-25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> It now seems certain that the fulfilment of this prophecy will be after the battle at Armageddon. Satan's forces will not conclude that Jehovah’s mighty army is too much for Satan and his forces and will therefore not make any attempt at peace terms. (Luke 14:31,32) Every part of Satan’s organization must ‘drink the cup of Jehovah’s wrath’. (Jer. 25:19-26) This particularly refers to the official part of their government or nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The psalmist, therefore, in the language above quoted, must refer to the people of sjunbolic Egypt or Ethiopia, the world, who are under the oppressive hand of Satan's organization but who have no sympathy with it, and particularly no sympathy with those of the enemy organization that delight to “war” against God’s people. There are millions of such now on earth, among whom there are some who are higher than others of their company. Hence these “high messengers” must be representatives of the poor and oppressed people over whom Satan’s official tools have cruelly misruled. Even at the present time some of the poor, both literally and in spirit, “haste to stretch out [their] hands” for the literature which tells them of Jehovah God and of his kingdom. For instance, Germany is one of the most greatly oppressed peoples of “Christendom”, and in that land, where there is so much suffering and oppression, in one week in the latter part of 1931 there were placed in the hands of the people one million, one hundred and fifty-six thousand, nine hundred and forty-one copies of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, The Hope of the World.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> When Armageddon has completely wrecked Satan’s wicked organization, and the bulls and those who delight in war lie dead upon the ground, the common people will know that the hand of Jehovah God has done this mighty work; and then, according to the prophecy uttered by the psalmist the “high messengers’’ shall come out of Egypt, and which people will then be seeking the way to Zion. (Jer. 50:5) Members of the remnant class then left on the earth will be privileged by the grace of the Lord to render valuable help to such as are honestly seeking the way to Zion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INVITATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> ‘ ‘ Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord.” (Vs. 32) Jehovah’s witnesses now, in obedience to his commandment, give the warning and the invitation advising the people to flee from Satan's organization and join in the praise to Jehovah’s name. (Ps. 2:10,12) The ruling powers of the world refuse to heed this warning and will not join in the song of praise to Jehovah. This is particularly true with reference to the high-up religious leaders, the clergy, and those who are the principal ones in their flocks and who desire to keep the flock together for a selfish purpose. This verse (thirty-two) of the sixty-eighth Psalm is further proof that the message of warning and testimony must be delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses to the ruling factors of the earth and also to the common people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The arrogant, haughty and austere will continue to go on in their wicked course, and it will be only those of good will amongst the common people who will take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and join in the song, ‘giving praise unto God.’ The Lord clearly shows his people in advance what shall come to pass. Therefore they know that this work of delivering the testimony and warning is not done according to the wisdom of man, but is commanded and directed by the Lord and must be done according to his will. The faithful remnant delight in doing it, because it is the expressed will of God and because it looks to the vindication of his name. They invite the kings and rulers and the peoples of the earth to join in the song, and will continue thus to do until God directs that it is finished.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THRONE CHARIOT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The day of deliverance is here, and it is a time for action. Seeing the progress of his glorious kingdom the remnant sing: “To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old: lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.” (Vs. 33) Jehovah is not now on a stationary throne, but, as the psalmist says, he is pictured in his ‘throne car’, moving forward and leading his organization. He is riding in his ‘throne chariot’ straight onward to meet the assault of Satan’s organization, which is mobilizing for Armageddon. Jehovah comes not alone. He rides upon the “ancient heavens”, “which were of old,” or “heavens of aforetime”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.,</span><span class="font3"> margin) Satan leads a company of traitors or rebels against God. Not all of the heavens have rebelled against God, however; but, on the contrary, there are myriads of heavenly companies that have remained true and ateadfast, maintaining their integrity toward God from the time of antiquity, and these are in his army. Jehovah rides ‘upon the heaven of the heavens’, meaning doubtless the capital or highest part of Jehovah’s organization, to wit, Christ Jesus, the King of glory. Since Christ was foreshadowed by Mel-chizedek and is Jehovah's Chief Officer and Priest after the order of Melchizedek, he is therefore the chief of the “heavens of antiquity”. (Prov. 8: 22-30) Jehovah rides upon all, because he is the Most High and because the Head of Christ is God.—1 Cor. 11: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Says the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version:</span><span class="font3"> “Lo, he uttereth his voice, and that a mighty voice.” It is the message of warning and the battle cry: “The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.” (Ps. 46:6) It is the battle cry that strikes terror to the enemy, because it means the enemy’s destruction. “The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.”—Jer. 25:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> This voice of warning he sounds just preceding the great battle of Armageddon. Jehovah now uses his instruments whom he has anointed, and into whose mouths he has put his words, to speak or publish his words, and to that degree they utter Jehovah’s voice or message. Each year the Lord has increased the strength of his message by sending a greater amount thereof into the hands of the people, and this he has done by the feeble efforts of hands of his witnesses to whom Jehovah has given strength. The archangel of Jehovah, who is his Chief Executive Officer, leads his mighty army, invisible indeed to man, but it joins in the voice of Jehovah God and which is now recognized by his faithful ones. (1 Thess. 4:16) The great battle of the day of God Almighty rapidly approaches. Let all take warning.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ALMIGHTY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> There is no power rightfully used except that which proceeds from Jehovah God. He is the Almighty; therefore the psalmist (68:34, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> says: “Ascribe ye strength unto God; his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies.” The anointed remnant now do this. These now say: “In the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.” (Isa. 26:4) On the contrary, the kings of the earth, upon the advice of the clergy, who are the religious officers of Satan’s organization, join together in a League of Nations and trust in that and in the ingenuity of man to deliver the perplexed and suffering world out of its present dilemma. These arrogant ones would perpetuate themselves, but they are certain to fall. Those who are wise ascribe all strength and power unto the Almighty God. “Give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength.” (Ps. 29:1) How unwise, how very foolish, are those who claim to know and to love God, and who tiien persist in giving honor and praise and exaltation to men! </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is written and published by the hand of men, but there is not a word of truth contained in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> that can properly be credited to any man. It is Jehovah God who gave the word or message and who feeds his people upon food that is convenient for them. Not one of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">faithful remnant </span><span class="font3">will henceforth say: “Brother Highway James certainly wrote that article for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and what a wonderful man he is! I am no fool; and he wrote it, I know, because I have sufficient wisdom to recognize his language.” Let none of God’s people be now given to foolishness. This is a time for serious study and action concerning God’s Word. Those in the past who have fallen because of pride or exaltation of men should be of sufficient notice to all who now claim to be serving God to walk before him in meekness and humility. Jesus refused to give any one, aside from Jehovah, credit for the truth. All of the faithful ones will now do likewise. “Over Israel is his majesty.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah God gave to his covenant people Israel the name Jeshurun, and the name means “upright”. “There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.” (Deut. 33:26) “Israel” in this text refers to the Christ, and there is one like the God of the Christ. The faithful remnant recognize this and joyfully proclaim it. Jehovah now rides majestically, and his excellency is over and above all, and including Christ, and hence Christ speaks of him as “the King of Eternity, my God and my King”. Now that Jehovah has come to his temple and has covered his faithful remnant with the shadow of his hands, his excellency is fully over the Israel of God for protection, and therefore ‘the glory of God is risen upon thee’; hence the Psalm says: “Ascribe ye strength unto God, his excellency is over Israel.” (Ps. 91:1) Jehovah speaks of his sanctified ones as ‘them that rejoice in my name’. (Isa. 13:3) God’s Israel on earth, his “faithful servant” class, delight to proclaim his name and rejoice therein.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The latter part of the thirty-fourth verse, according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font3"> reads: “And his strength is in the skies.” This means that he is high above all powers and there is none besides him. ‘ ‘ Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which arc higher than thou.” (Job 35:5) “Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten lookingglass?” (Job 37:18) The proper conclusion drawn from the words “his strength is in the clouds” or “in the skies” manifestly is that the great demonstration of Jehovah’s power will take place in the beclouded skies and will be seen by all creation. Clouds symbolize the presence of the Lord. Jehovah will be present at Armageddon, particularly represented by Christ Jesus, his Chief Executive Officer. Necessarily Armageddon must and will be such an open demonstration of Jehovah’s power that all creation may see and know that it is Jehovah God that is performing this wonderful and strange act.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> In support of this conclusion, it is written, in Revelation 1:7: “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.” The Greek word here used to translate “see”, according to accredited authority, means “to gaze with wide open eyes at something remarkable”. The “strange act” mentioned by the prophet will be remarkable and wonderful to behold. (Isa. 28:21) That strange act will take place, as the Scriptures show, at Armageddon. Then the people will realize that the faithful remnant are “the feet of him”, and whom they have helped to pierce, and all the peoples of earth will smite themselves and wail because of the terrible and remarkable things they shall then see. Jehovah by his prophet says: “The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad. The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. ’ ’—Ps. 77:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> The flood of Noah's day foreshadowed the great and terrible day of God Almighty, and that flood was a manifestation of God's power in the clouds. “When he established the clouds above; when he strengthened the fountains of the deep [above the earth].” (Prov. 8:28) It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that at the battle of Armageddon there will be such a demonstration in the skies of Jehovah's power that terror will lay hold upon all. ‘ ‘ He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his secret place: his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.” (Ps. 18:9-12) Thus the Lord’s presence will be manifested in the clouds or skies in the terrible time of trouble, and all eyes of the universe shall behold it, and all the tribes of earth will mourn because of it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TERRIBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The Psalm-Song (sixty-eight) concludes with the words of verse thirty-five: “0 God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places; the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.” Jehovah God has now come to his holyplace, his sanctuary or temple on Zion, and this text proves that he will reveal himself therefrom or out therefrom in terrifying acts at the battle of Armageddon, when such acts can ‘make the hair of the ilesh stand up’, as it did on one of Job’s tormentors. (Job 4:14,15) At the inauguration of the law covenant at Sinai the scene which was beheld by all eyes there was a terrible one, so terrible that all cried out with fear. (Heb. 12:19) At or immediately preceding the inauguration of the new covenant that which the people will behold will be equally terrible as or even more so than that at Mount Sinai. (Ex. 34:10) The time must come when the peoples of earth will realize that Jehovah is the only true God. “For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.” (Ps. 47:2) Then the enemies of God shall know that he is Jehovah. (Ezek. 6:10) “Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee. . . . Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.” (Ps. 66: 3-5) The rulers of the earth must go down, and they will know immediately before this takes place that the hand of God is pulling them down. “He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.”—Ps. 76:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> It is worse than foolishness, then, to conclude that the word “terrible” mentioned in this text, and other texts mentioning the terrible battle of Jehovah, means merely “inspiring reverence”. The organization which Jehovah will bring against the enemy is compared by Ezekiel to the “worst of the heathen [nations] ’ ’. This indicates that it will be the most terrible thing thaf human eyes have ever beheld. That time the Prophet Joel describes as ‘ ‘ the great and the terrible day of Jehovah”, and it must be so. (Joel 2:31) The prophet gives a description of Armageddon, which shows that the people will look upon it with indescribable terror. (Ilab. 3:1-14) Moses was terrified at what his eyes beheld at Sinai. “And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake.” (Heb. 12:21) It will be even so with the remnant of Mount Zion at Armageddon. These will be terror-stricken, even though they will know that by the grace of God they are saved. Christ Jesus, the Executive Officer of Jehovah, will execute “these terrible deeds”, as the psalmist states: “And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand [Jehovah] shall teach thee terrible things.” (Ps. 45:4) “The coming of the Lord Jesus” to the battle of Armageddon, therefore, will be in clouds, and every eye shall gaze with terror on what they shall behold.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> “The God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.” &quot;Without his strength the anointed could not stand for one moment; therefore they sing: “Jehovah is my strength and my song.” (Isa. 12:2) “The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.” (Ps. 28:8) “In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.” (Ps. 138: 3) The day approaches for the great fight, and Jehovah calls to his anointed remnant, which forms a part of his organization, and says: “Awake, awake, put on thy strength, 0 Zion.” Jehovah God will give strength to his people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The faithful remnant are near the end of their earthly pilgrimage. Soon these shall see the manifestation of Jehovah’s power for the vindication of his name. The enemy is putting forth his greatest efforts against the remnant; and the apostle, looking down especially to this day, wrote concerning it: “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.” (Eph. 6:10) Those who remain true and steadfast and maintain their integrity toward God need have no fear, because his promise is: “The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace. ’ ’—Ps. 29:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> There is much work for Jehovah's witnesses to do in the publication of the name and kingdom of God. Were it otherwise, Jehovah would be wasting strength and power on his people; and we know that Jehovah is not a waster. His expressed purpose is to give the enemy full warning before destroying him and his organization, and also to serve notice upon the people in order that they of good will may take their stand on his side and live. This work he has graciously committed to the remnant on earth, who are a people taken out from the world for his name to show forth his praises. The company of the remnant is small in number and of little strength. They are weak in body, and they have little of earthly possessions and very small influence amongst men; but they are anointed to the service of Jehovah, and he supplies their strength. Having these things in mind the apostle wrote: “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us.” (2 Cor. 4:7) “My strength is made perfect in weakness. ’ ’—2 Cor. 12: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Let no one of Jehovah’s witnesses become discouraged or faint-hearted. The greatest favor ever conferred upon creatures is to be faithful and true witnesses for Jehovah. This favor to us is greatly enhanced when we realize that God has chosen the weak things, which have nothing, that he might bring to nothing the things that now are. (1 Cor. 1:28) Our part in this great work is ‘to preach this gospel of the kingdom as a witness to all the nations’, and when this work is done Armageddon will be upon the enemy and shall sweep him and his organization out of existence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> For many centuries the people have suffered under the cruel hand of the oppressor. The day of suffering and oppression now grows worse, and Satan by his agents attempts to induce the people to believe that all their sufferings proceed from God because they have been negligent of their church obligations, his purpose being to turn the people away from Jehovah and cause them to curse him. God commands his witnesses, therefore, to go and tell the people that their present woe and suffering proceed from the Devil, because he has been cast down to earth, and that he knows that his time for the preparation for the final war is very short. (Rev. 12:12) He commands them to inform the people that Jehovah is the only God and that his kingdom is here, and that soon his kingdom will destroy the enemy and establish righteousness on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;<sup>3</sup> Long ago God caused to be written this sixtyeighth Psalm; and now he shows his people what marvelous truths are hidden therein by revealing the same to those who love him. Thus he feeds his people upon the food convenient for them and gives them all the needed strength to carry forward the work to which he has assigned them. Considering this Psalm-Song, and the deep truths therein contained, God’s faithful remnant spontaneously exclaim, as in the language of the psalmist: “Blessed be God.’’ The “faithful servant” class blesses (that is, praises) Jehovah by publishing to the world his greatness and his name. To do this they must work. “All thy works shall praise thee, 0 Lord; and .thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.”—Ps. 145:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> The time has come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. His kingdom will accomplish that work. The present work assigned to the “faithful servant” class, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, is to publicly proclaim his name and his kingdom. The climax of the whole matter will be that in due time all the peoples of the earth, and all creation, in fact everything that has and will maintain the breath of life, will be praising Jehovah God. “My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.” (Ps. 145: 21) “Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord. Praise ye the Lord.”— Ps. 150:6.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>OBEDIENCE BRINGS APPROVAL</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">F</span><span class="font3">ROM the time of his birth until he reached the age of thirty years very little is said about Jesus. At that age he had reached his majority, and there his work in the earth began. He proceeded immediately to John and requested John to baptize him in the waters of the Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Anointing is a symbol of delegated power and authority. When Jehovah would signify that he had conferred authority upon David as king he caused his prophet to anoint David with oil. (1 Sam. 16:13) “I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him.” (Ps. 89:20) “And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul. ’ ’—2 Sam. 12: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wherever the Scriptures speak of “the Lord’s anointed” that term almost exclusively refers to the ruler or governor. (Ps. 2:2; Lam. 4:20) The titles Messiah and Christ mean “the Anointed One”. The title is used particularly with reference to rulership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Daniel the prophet spoke of Messiah, or the Anointed One, as “the Prince” or ruling One. (Dan. 9: 25) The Jews so understood the term Messiah to mean ‘He who should rule’. The Jews were looking for a king or ruler who should relieve them from the Roman yoke and establish a just and righteous government. When some of the faithful Jews had learned from John concerning Jesus and had seen Jesus they spoke to their brethren and said: “We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ” (the Anointed [One], margin). (John 1:41) God’s prophet testified that the Anointed One is the rightful Ruler of the earth: “I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. ’ ’—Dan. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7:</span><span class="font3">13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The baptism of Jesus in the waters of the Jordan symbolically testified that he had agreed to be entirely submissive to the will of Jehovah God. God there announced his approval of Jesus. “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: and, lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matt. 3:16,17) Soon thereafter he was anointed by Jehovah with his spirit and power. The Scriptural proof is that his anointing showed that he was clothed with power in due time to destroy the wicked organization of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the holy spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him.” (Acts 10:38) “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of Ged was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”—1 John 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time of the anointing of Jesus God conferred upon him the authority and power to be God's Priest and Prince. He was there appointed to the office of Priest and Prince for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110: 4; Heb. 6: 20; 7:17) Let the fact be kept in mind that Melchizedek was a priest upon his throne. As a priest he was a servant of the Most High, and therefore the Most High’s special officer; and as a prince he was a ruler or king acting by authority from the Most High. Melchizedek was a type of the great Ruler who shall rule the world by divine right and authority. It was at the time of the baptism of Jesus that the authority to be King or Ruler was conferred upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The anointing of Jesus carried with it the power and authority and obligation to tell the people who would hear, of and concerning the government that God would erect and how the people could be relieved from Satan’s rule. Shortly after his anointing at the Jordan he said in the presence of the Pharisees and people: “The spirit of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font3"> is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.” (Luke 4:18,19) On that occasion he was quoting from the Prophet Isaiah, who had foretold what should be done by the Anointed of the Lord when on earth. (Isa. 61:1-3) He stated on that occasion that on that day he began the fulfilment of that prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4:17) During the three and one-half years of his ministry that followed, Christ Jesus emphasized the fact of God’s kingdom or government of righteousness that should be established for the benefit of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now let us examine the purpose of the temptation of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There must be a preparatory work concerning himself as earth’s rightful Ruler. At the very outset of his work Jesus was subjected to great temptation or test. He had been forty days and nights in the wilderness without food. It was at the end of those forty days of fasting that the temptation came to him. Why had he gone to that place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures answer: “Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil.” (Matt. 4:1) To be sure, it was the spirit of Jehovah that led Jesus into the wilderness, because he had agreed to do Jehovah’s will and was being led</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">by the power of Jehovah. But why should Jehovah God even permit his beloved Son to be beset by Satan the Devil and subjected to temptation? Briefly, the answer is that Jesus by withstanding this temptation or trial might prove his loyalty and faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be tempted means to be put to a test. Jehovah would anoint his Son Jesus to be King or Ruler, and before so anointing him God would prove his Son by a severe test. Jesus had always been loyal and true to his Father, but now he was to be anointed to be God’s great Prince and King to rule the world, and God would prove his Son by actual experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of Satan, of course, in placing the temptation before Jesus was to induce Jesus to break his agreement with Jehovah, which would have resulted in his (Jesus’) own destruction. If Jesus would break his agreement with God to be obedient to him, he would die and of course would not take the office of Ruler over the world. If Jesus would prove his faithfulness and loyalty to God under the test, he would prove himself entirely worthy to be trusted with the great authority and power, as Ruler of the world. Therefore God permitted the enemy Satan to apply the test, and God saw to it that that test resulted to his own praise and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The subtle and wily enemy Satan put the temptation before Jesus. He knew that Jesus, having fasted forty days, was hungry. He said to him: “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” The reply of Jesus was: “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” Moses had in substance said the same thing to the Israelites, that their life depended upon faithfulness in the keeping of their covenant with God. (Deut. 8:3) Jesus was holding firmly to that rule. He resisted the Tempter and proved his faithfulness to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan, knowing God purposed to anoint Jesus to be Ruler, and knowing the opposition that Jesus would have among the Pharisees, thought to entrap Jesus by inducing him to perform some daring and spectacular feat. He thought to appeal to his pride. The enemy, therefore, in substance said to Jesus: ‘Why don’t you go up on the temple and jump off into the valley? God's angels will bear you up so that you won’t be hurt; and the people, seeing this miracle, will be convinced that you arc more than an ordinary man and they will more readily support you.’ That proposition was seductive, diplomatic, politic and cruel. Jesus replied: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil then and there laid claim to rulership of all the kingdoms of the world. Jesus did not dispute that claim. In fact, Satan was then the god of the whole world. The Devil then proposed to Jesus that he would abdicate and turn over the rulership of the world to Jesus provided Jesus would worship the Devil. Had Jesus done so, he would have shown his disloyalty and unfaithfulness to God and would have been destroyed. His reply to Satan was: “Thou shalt worship [Jehovah] thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this great test Satan had lost. Jesus had won, and God had proven his Son to be loyal, faithful and true. (Ma“. 4:1-10; Luke 4:1-13) Then the Devil left Jesus for a season. Never during the three and one-half years that Jesus was on earth did Satan miss an opportunity to try to entrap Jesus and destroy him. The temptations that he put before him were divers and numerous and were advanced in a subtle and wily manner. Through them all Jesus proved his full devotion to his Father. This was a part of the preparatory work for rulership.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>CREATION OF LUCIFER AND MAN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font3">MONGST the mighty creatures of Jehovah God is the one who at first was called “Lucifer”. His name means light-bearer or “morning star”. God’s prophet Isaiah (14:12) speaks of him as the “son of the morning”. It would be difficult to find words more descriptive of beauty. Lucifer belonged to the heavenly realm and was therefore in the holy kingdom of God and a part of his organization, and the prophetic description of him shows that he was shining forth amongst the others of that glorious place. This description indicates that he was more showy than the other creatures of heaven. Of him it is written that “every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.”—Ezek. 28:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Logos, the active agent of Jehovah God in the creation of all things, of course, created Lucifer; for the Apostle John so states, saying: “In the beginning was the Word [The Logos], and the Word [The Logos] was with God, and the Word [The Logos] was [a] god. [According to the Greek text] The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him [The Logos]; and without him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1:1-3) These two creatures of God, Lucifer and the Logos, are designated in the Scriptures as ‘ ‘ the morning stars”. The Logos was always the delight of the great Eternal One because of his faithfulness. Since the inspired Scriptures declare that all the creation of God is perfect (Deut. 32:4), the presumption must be indulged that all these creatures in heaven were beautiful and glorious, dwelling together in peace and in harmony, and all giving glory and praise to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the course of time it pleased the Almighty Eternal One to prepare a place for the habitation of man, whom he then purposed to create. The sacred record is: ‘‘In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” and he ‘‘made the cloud the garment [of the earth during creation], and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it”. (Job 38:4,9) In heaven these creatures, namely, the Logos and Lucifer, and the cherubim, seraphim, and angels, no doubt were informed that the planet earth was being prepared as a place for the habitation of the creature man whom God would create in his own image, and this knowledge must have greatly delighted God’s heavenly creatures. It is recorded that when God laid the foundation of the earth for man’s habitation “the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy”.—Job 38:4-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures clearly teach that there were two mighty creatures designated “morning stars”, to wit, The Logos and Lucifer. There must have been a great convocation of the glorious creatures of heaven at the beginning of the creation of earth, and it was at this convocation that the creatures were advised by the Creator of his purpose to prepare a habitation for man and to create man; and there these two mighty ones, “the morning stars,” sang together a song of praise to the Eternal One, and every one of the sons of God was so thrilled by the song that they shouted together for joy. So far as men know there is no other planet that is inhabited. The creation of the earth for man would be of most profound interest to the creatures of the heavenly realm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The earth was created; and upon it were placed the plants and the herbs, the beast and the fowl, the fruits and the flowers. But there was no man to till the ground nor to enjoy the produce thereof. (Gen. 2:5) God must have spoken to someone of his purpose to create man, and it is reasonable that the Logos, the only begotten Son of God, would have been the one to whom he spoke. It is recorded: “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of .the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”—Gen. 1:26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems quite clear that the expressions “image” and “likeness” here do not mean form or organism. The four divine primary attributes possessed by Jehovah forever are wisdom, justice, love and power. The perfect man, the intelligent creature, must have been endowed with these attributes; and as God has dominion over the universe, so man was given dominion over the creatures of the earth and was clothed with power to produce his species, fill the earth and subdue the planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God did not create man and then give him an immortal soul, as many have been induced to believe. The words “soul”, “creature” and “man” mean the same thing. Every man is a soul, but no man can possess a soul. The statement or method of creation is plainly set forth in the Scriptures; it reads: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”—Gen. 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then God caused all the, beasts and the fowl to pass before Adam, and he gave each one its name. Each beast and each fowl found its mate or kind. “But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.” “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make him an help meet for him.” (Gen. 2:  18-20) Then the woman was made and brought unto the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That part of the earth where man first saw the light must have been surpassingly beautiful. The name “Eden” means a paradise. It was on the eastern side of Eden that God planted a garden, and there he put man, whom he had formed, to dress and to keep it. This was the home of Adam and his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Taking as a basis this brief record, which we know is true because made under divine supervision, we may draw upon the imagination for a moment. In heaven there was a great and happy multitude of angels, strong, vigorous and beautiful. There were the cherubim and seraphim, holding responsible positions of trust and confidence. There was Lucifer, the bright shining one, who surpassed the others in show and beauty. And there was the Logos, the great and mighty right arm of Jehovah God, by whom all things were created that were made. All these creatures were the delight of the Mighty Creator, and especially was that true of the Logos. Up to that time all were loyal and true to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the earth now was the perfect man, strong, vigorous and handsome; with eyes so keen that they knew no dimness, and with the agility and swiftness of the hind. And with him was his wife, possessing grace and surpassing beauty such as no man now on this earth has ever beheld, for she was perfect. Without doubt there was some means of communication established between those of heaven and the perfect creatures of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The man and the woman were endowed with power and authority to bring forth children and to fill the earth with their descendants, and the heavenly creatures must have observed this with the keenest interest and joy. There is no evidence that any of the heavenly creatures were endowed with power to produce any offspring. The propagation of the race on earth was then new and novel, and all the heavenly hosts must have waited and watched with deepest concern for the time to come when man would fill the earth with a joyful race of people, all of whom would worship and praise the great Jehovah God. Happiness reigned in heaven and happiness reigned on earth. The environment was beautiful, pleasing to the eye, a joy to the heart, and all to the praise of the Eternal God, the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every perfect creature must be a free moral agent. The creature must have the liberty to exercise his power for good or evil as he may choose. In no other way could he be tested and proven. God could have made all his creatures so that they could not do evil, but, had he done so, that would have prevented them from exercising freely their attributes and God would thereby preclude himself from testing and proving his creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The heart is the seat of affection or motive. It is that faculty of the creature which induces action. If impurity enters the heart, impurity of action is almost certain to follow. Hence it is written: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life. ’ ’—Prov. 4: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Love is one of the divine attributes. Love is the perfect expression of unselfishness. Selfishness, the very antithesis of love, begins in the secret intent of the heart. Selfishness expels love. With love gone the heart becomes malicious. The creature possessing a malicious heart is one who is extremely selfish, having no regard for duty or obligation to others and fatally bent on accomplishing his purposes regardless of great wrong that may result to others</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The glory and beauty of the heavenly creatures, the perfection of the human pair in their Eden home, and the power and authority of man to fill the earth with his kind, furnished the opportunity for exercising either selfishness or love. The test came, and some of the mighty creatures of heaven fell under the test. The joy of heaven and earth was turned into great woe. But not for ever. For then not only did justice divine step in to render judgment, but God's love and wisdom originated his great purpose for the vindication of his name and word by the reestablishment in his own due time of peace and order and joy in heaven and in earth and by the destruction of all the wicked who resist his will. This grand vindication the Almighty God will perform through his kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Sister Jernigan and I are both workers with the Norfolk company and in full harmony with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> The article in the December 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> ‘‘The Decisive Test,” is sufficient to show that no half-hearted devotion can be acceptable to the Lord at this time. It is my earnest prayer that I may forever be ready and willing to do his will joyfully, as he may indicate it to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">pray that Jehovah will continue to give you strength and courage, and bless you in your unselfish labor of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By his grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RENEWED STRENGTH AND ZEAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of February there were held four meetings, which were each attended by five brethren. We have finished the study of the ‘‘Esther and Mordecai” articles. These articles have been indeed very interesting and encouraging to us, giving us renewed strength and zeal for the great ‘Kingdom’ campaign in which we are about to engage. It is grand to see the manifestation of God’s wisdom and love in providing the book of Esther for the benefit of his people now living on earth. For all this we give praise and honor to the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the Lord continue to bless you and your labor of love. I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Your sister and coworker by His grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">H. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anz, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary, Tallinn, Esihonta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WORK AND JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Friends :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the time of the Columbus com ention practically all of the Columbus friends v.ere present and voted for the resolution to adopt the new name, ‘‘Jehovah’s witnesses.” However, we have decided that we should go on record as accepting the new name; so at the business meeting held recently this was done by unanimous rising vote of the company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Columbus convention was a great blessing to us. There have been about seventeen who have symbolized their consecration since the convention. Our hall is filled on Sunday night, many new faces appearing. The workers can see a great ‘ division of the waters’: the people taking a more firm stand for 01 against Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are getting great joy through the meat in due season, appearing in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font2"> books, I </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">indication</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love and joy, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Columbus</span><span class="font2"> (Ohio) </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCOURAGED TO TESTIFY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Greetings in Jehovah’s name!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">have just completed reading the January 15 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tower, </span><span class="font2">‘‘Faint-hearted or Faithful.” Anyone who reads this article, and very carefully studies it, and then does not go out and testify surely has not the love of the truth. Every </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">article seems more precious and certainly is an encouragement to us to testify to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have the privilege of being director here and every friend is in full harmony with the service. All the elders go out to testify. Some of them who are not able to go during the week go out on Sunday, and usually travel about 50 or 75 miles one way to the territory. They are generally out from eight to ten hours, and they certainly rejoice for this wonderful privilege. No one can seive as an elder for the Pueblo company of Jehovah’s witnesses unless he is in full harmony with the work as the Society informs us it is to be carried out and he goes out in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We certainly rejoiced when we were informed that we were to change our name to ‘‘Jehovah’s witnesses”. By unanimous vote we adopted the new name immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We set our quota for 50,000 testimonies and 12,000 books and booklets, and with the Lord’s help we will try to exceed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother and fellow servant in Zion,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> F. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Suckle, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Colo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INCENTIVE TO GREATER ACTIVITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Co-laborers at Bethel,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Gary (Ind.) company of Jehovah’s witnesses desires that a line be sent to you in assurance of our whole-hearted cooperation with you in giving forth this wonderful message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have companies here of five different tongues (English, Lithuanian, Polish, Slavic, and Greek), all working as one body to the glory of Jehovah’s word and name. We were all very glad to accept the new name, ‘ ‘ Jehovah’s witnesses, ’ ’ and our desire is to be worthy of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The food given us through the later books and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Towers </span><span class="font2">is most gratifying, and an incentive spurring us on to greater activity in witnessing for and concerning </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah God</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS KINGDOM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We continually pray the Lord’s blessing on your efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DELIGHT TO FEED AND PASS TRUTH ON</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In February we have had five meetings on Mondays. Forty-two members in attendance. Bro. Oman has been leading all the meetings. Next Monday we shall have to study ‘‘Fourth Trumpet”, Revelation 8, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font2"> We delight to feed upon the truth and also to pass it on to otheis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tomorrow the Norwegian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, The Hope of the World,</span><span class="font2"> will be in our possession. The friends look forward with pleasure to it and have made preparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All in the office send you their love and hearty greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your sister in the Lord,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ottilie Mydland, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Norway.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SERVICE LEADERS AND REGIONAL SERVICE DIRECTORS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font3">N MAY of each year the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States have been asked to renew their requests for service leaders for the ensuing year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is no longer sending out the service leaders, except in a very limited way and at irregular intervals. Regional service directors, however, serve all the companies and “sharpshooters” in the United States that are organized for service, at least once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All being members of one body, anointed to serve the Lord, it is the desire of the Society to keep in touch with every company. To this end we request that the secretary bring this matter to the attention of the company, and furnish us with the following information, answering all questions if possible, and send the answers to the Service Department. Isolated brethren and “sharpshooters” are requested to do likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Number each answer to correspond with the number of the question. Write plainty, and give the street address where possible, as telegrams cannot be delivered to a post office box.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(a) State the number in your company who are in harmony with the Society and the work it is doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(b) Are weekly meetings held?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(c) At what hours are Sunday meetings held?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(d) Are conditions such that your company can entertain a service leader or regional service director?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(c) Are those interested in the Kingdom work organized for service?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(f) If not, would you like the assistance of a regional service director to help you organize?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(g) Give full name and street address of the company secretary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(h) Give name and address of another to whom we could send notice.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(i) Give the name of your railway station.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(j) If in the country, state distance from station and if the brother will be met.</span></p></li></ul>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>GOOD HOPES FOR 1932-1933</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the preaching of the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom. Every consecrated child of God is privileged to participate in this work. Since the organization of the Society the work during the year has always been outlined in proportion as the Lord provided the money through his consecrated children. We continue to follow that example, as appropriate in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each one who has been enlightened by the truth appreciates the fact that this blessing came to him as a gracious gift; and as he has a zeal for the Lord he appreciates his privileges of using time, energy, and money in telling the message to others. Some who are doing as much house-to-house witness work as their conditions allow are also blessed with some money which they desire to use in the Lord’s service, to the end that hungry souls which they cannot personally reach might be fed upon the precious kingdom-gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The custom of setting aside each week so much to be used in the Lord’s service has always proved beneficial to the giver. A notice to the Society that you hope to give so much, enables us to outline the work, based upon what is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upon receipt of this issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">kindly write two cards, exactly alike. One of these put aside for your own record of what you have promised; the other send to us. Or, if you prefer, put it in the form of a letter, keeping a copy of the letter for your own convenience. We suggest that it be brief and that nothing be written except the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the Lord’s grace I hope to be able to give to his work for spreading the gospel during the ensuing year the amount of $------------------- I will remit in such amounts and at</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">such times as I can find convenient, according as the Lord prospers me. (Signature)-------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kindly address this card to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Financial Department,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brethren residing outside of the United States should write their respective offices in the countries where they reside, and remit their “Good Hopes” to such offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of our own selves we can do nothing, but we are assured that the prayers of the righteous avail much. Hence we ask the brethren to present us daily before the throne of heavenly grace, that we may be given wisdom and grace to use the money to the best advantage in spreading the gospel to the Lord’s glory, and to do the work entrusted to us.</span></p>
