<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Debate by Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">P</span><span class="font6">REVIOUS issues oE this magazine have published the tacts concerning the persecution oE humble men and women because they were engaged in the same work that Jesus and the apostles did, to wit, going from house to house with the gospel or good news of God’s kingdom and informing the people. Many good citizens have become so incensed and grieved because of the unjust treatment of these harmless persons that Judge Rutherford was requested to broadcast by radio the answer to the question, “Why are Jehovah’s witnesses persecuted?” On May 1 a number of radio stations in the East were linked together in a chain broadcast and used by Judge Rutherford in a forty-minute speech in answer to the question. We set out that speech in full in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford declared that the combined clergy in the land are the real persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. Furthermore, he charged that the clergy claimed to represent Jehovah God but in fact represent the Devil, and are against the best interests of the people. In the course of his radio speech Judge Rutherford called upon all the clergymen to jointly agree upon and select one man as their spokesman to engage in a nation-wide debate by radio. He promised that Jehovah’s witnesses would select a man to take the other side of the debate, and suggested that each side pay one-half the cost. He also named the questions that should be debated in the interest of the people, which questions are set out in his speech published below. He requested those who favored the debate’s being had to write him and that he would submit the letters to the public press. On May 12 the editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> called upon Judge Rutherford and requested that he might examine some of the letters the people had sent in. This request was gladly granted and a pile of letters were handed over, with the understanding that any newspaper may have access to them if desired for the purpose of informing the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately following the speech of Judge Rutherford, as herein set out, we publish a few of these letters, which are good samples of the many that have been received. Although twelve days had elapsed since the challenge was broadcast, no clergyman or company of clergymen had come forward and signified that the challenge would be accepted. An interview of one clergyman was published in a two-by-four newspaper in New Jersey in which he is reported as saying: “The charge of Judge Rutherford is trivial and not worthy of notice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> asked Judge Rutherford the following questions, and his answers appear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. You suggested that each side pay one-half the expense of the radio debate. Is the side that you represent in a position to pay one-half the expense?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. I am fully assured by good and honest persons who desire to see righteousness in the land that the money for one-half of this expense is ready to be paid over when requested. I do not favor taking up a collection for this purpose or soliciting money, and t find that such will not be necessary, so far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned, because those who loxe righteousness have volunteered and agreed to finance this side of the debate. A radio station in every state should be tied into the chain and all the people of America and Canada be given an opportunity to hear mid then to decide for themselves what is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Is it your purpose to try to convert the people and to advertise yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. No, I am making no attempt to convert people and induce them to join something; and as for making a reputation for myself, the opinion of man concerning me is of little value so far as this controversy is concerned. My sole purpose is to aid tho people to hear the truth, that they may have an opportunity to know who is Jehovah God and His purposes, and to take their stand on the side of righteousness and live and receive God’s blessings. This is a time of the greatest crisis in the world's history, and hence the people should hear.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">B15</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Q. Would you expect the debate to reform the clergymen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.A. No, there is not one chance for that to be the result. They are set in their ways, and there they will remain. I am interested in the vindication of Jehovah's name for the welfare of ilie people. I have no desire to do injury to the clergymen; I would not harm a hair of their heads; but I am certain that they are blind, and, as Jesus said, they are blind guides trying to lead the people for a. selfish purpose and the people should be informed of the trulli. The clergy greatly defame Jehovah's name and they are misleading the people. It appears that God's due time has come when the people shall have an opportunity to hear the truth. My opinion is that the truth of and concerning Jehovah's kingdom is of the greatest importance. The radio is the best means of communicating the truth to the people. The Radio Act provides that stations should broadcast that which is of public interest, convenience and necessity. Convenience means that which is upbuilding and helpful to the people. Nothing, therefore, could be more convenient than the truth. Such information is of greatest interest to all thinking persons and surely is of the greatest necessity in this time of stress. For that reason the radio should be employed to quickly convey the truth to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Q. Are you of the opinion that the clergy will accept that challenge for this radio debate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A. Of course I cannot answer that question with entire certainty at this time, but I am of the opinion that they will not accept it. I am a firm believer, as you doubtless know, of what the prophets of God have prophesied and which prophecies are set forth in the Bible. These prophecies were written for the benefit of men and women now on earth who love God and righteousness. “Babylon” is one of the names given to the Devil's organization, in which organization false religion is particularly emphasized. The men of ancient Babylon foreshadowed the clergy of modern Babylon, which is “organized Christianity”, so called, or otherwise called “Christendom”. God's prophet Jeremiah prophesied concerning Babylon, which prophecy applies in those days to the clergy of “Christendom”. The big clergymen of the Catholic and Protestant organizations, including the Federation of Churches, the prophet of God ironically speaks of as “mighty men”. They are mighty, as you know, in their own estimation, and they love to convince the people of their greatness. These men have swaggered about amongst the people and induced many to believe that they are really important men and arc the only safe spiritual guides for mankind. Yet the Scriptures indicate that they are not willing to defend their position when put to the test. Concerning them it is written, in Jeremiah’s prophecy (51:30), these words: “The mighty men of Babylon have for-born to fight, they have remained in their holds; their might hath failed; they became as women.” You can judge from that the real situation. The prophet could not have more accurately described the present situation. The fact that these “mighty men” have remained silent for two weeks following the challenge is very persuasive evidence that they do not intend to come out of their strongholds and meet the issue. I hope the people, however, will not be further deceived by them but will individually seek a knowledge of the truth for their own welfare. There is but one hope for the people, and that is God’s kingdom, and they must be informed about it before they can receive the benefits thereof.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses: Why Persecuted? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Jitdyc J. F. Rutherford</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Chain broadcast Sunday May 1, I'.U’.e, Key station The Watch Tower, WBBIt, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rpTIE purpose of this speech is to tell the pco-pie the truth that is of vital importance to them and which they are entitled to hoar. The purpose is not to provoke a controversy; but if the truth can be told only by having a controversy with those who oppose the truth, then the responsibility for that controversy is upon the opposers or wrongdoers. Ultimately these opposers will have to answer before the court of the Almighty God for their wrongdoing in opposing the proclamation of the message of Uis kingdom. They are not fighting against men merely, but against the King of Eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently in the towns of Bergenfield, Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, and in divers places in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, and other places, good men and women while engaged in an effort to do good, and while bringing comfort to the people now in distress, have been ruthlessly arrested, cursed and abused by officers, and otherwise illtrealed and thrown into dungeons. Thousands of other fair-minded persons, shocked and stunned by such wrongful acts on the part of public officers, have made inquiry as to why these harmless men and women are thus persecuted. I have been asked to broadcast the answer to that question and I am thankful for the opportunity so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These men and women who have been thus arrested and persecuted are Jehovah's witnesses engaged in the performance of their lawful and rightful duties. Who is Jehovah? He is the great God of the universe, the Creator of heaven and earth, the Giver of everything that is good, and whom every person must know and obey in order that they might live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nineteen hundred years ago, when the babe Jesus was born at Bethlehem, Jehovah’s angel from heaven declared this message: ‘Behold, I bring you good news of great joy which shall be unto all people; He who is to be the King of the world is born and He will bring peace on earth and good will toward men.’ (Luke 2:9-11) Since then those who love God and His righteous government have looked forward to the day of His kingdom and have rejoiced to tell others of its coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time for the Kingdom is now come. How may we know that fact? The Bible, at Matthew twenty-four, and at Luke twenty-one, gives the language of the Lord, who said that His coming and His kingdom would be ushered in at the time of great distress and perplexity on the earth, when men’s hearts are failing them for fear of what they see approaching, and that at such time wickedness would run riot. Everyone knows that exactly these conditions now exist all over the earth. In this connection and concerning this same time the Lord commanded His witnesses, saying to them: ‘This gospel of the Kingdom must now be preached or told to the people as a testimony to them.’ Those who love God and obey His commandments have no alternative. Their life depends upon faithfully doing God’s will. They must tell the people the good news of the Kingdom, and they must and will do this as Jehovah’s witnesses, even at the cost of their lives.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>How?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">How are Jehovah’s witnesses to preach the gospel? In these latter days God has brought forward the radio, and by reason thereof some of the people are enabled to remain at their homes and hear a portion of the message concerning the Kingdom broadcast to them. The people are anxious to learn more, and to this end to apply themselves to study. To enable the people to get a better understanding of Jehovah’s purpose to set up a righteous government and bless mankind the gospel or good news is printed in book form, and in obedience to His commandment and because of their love for God, and their desire to help the people, Jehovah’s witnesses now go from house to house and exhibit to the people books containing this message and thus afford the people an opportunity to study and to understand the Bible. In the same way Jesus and the apostles went from house to house teaching the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These witnesses of Jehovah receive from the people a small amount of money for the books to enable them to publish more books of the same kind. Are these men and women engaged in a book-selling scheme for pecuniary profit? Most assuredly not! They work in their shops or fields to earn their bread. They live in a frugal manner and then give all the time and money that they can spare to the preaching of the gospel of God's kingdom. The cost of production and delivery is far in excess of the money received for the books. This deficit is made up by voluntary contributions by men and women who are anxious to do what they can to enlighten the people concerning God’s kingdom. It has been charged that I make a profit from the ‘sale’ of these books, which charge is wholly untrue. Because I have written these books the copyright is taken in my name and then immediately assigned to the publishing company without one cent of royalty to me, the consideration being that the message shall be delivered to the people at the least possible cost to them and that the poor shall receive the message of truth without money and without price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses are not rich in this world’s coin, and therefore cannot make and supply so many books entirely free. The opportunity is therefore given to all who can, and who so desire, to use some of their own money to further the work of making known to their fellow man the good news of God’s kingdom. Every person who hears this good news and who has a sincere desire to see a righteous government for the people on earth wants to have some part in spreading this good news to others. This is one of the reasons why more than one hundred million of these books have been placed with the families of the people during the past ten years and many in these families have been greatly comforted and refreshed by this good news. There has never been a work on earth that has brought so much comfort to the people as this, for the reason that it is a work of bringing to the people the truth concerning Jehovah God’s kingdom, which Kingdom is the only hope of relief for the world's suffering millions. It is not a propaganda movement to obtain joiners, but wholly an educational work for the general welfare of the people.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Kingdom Benefits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Why is God's kingdom so important to the people? In brief I answer that long ago God created man perfect. Man was induced to do wrong by God's enemy, and which wrongdoing brought suffering and death into the world and all men have suffered since. Throughout the centuries a few of the strong have ruled and oppressed the weaker. The unrighteous have wielded the scepter of power and the meek have been compelled to submit. That unrighteous rule has reached a climax and today in all nations the people are suffering. Nineteen centuries ago God provided redemption for mankind through the lifeblood of His beloved Son Jesus. Jehovah God gave His Word of promise that in His due time He would set up a government of righteousness for man and that in that righteous government wrongdoing would be restrained and wickedness destroyed and that all who would learn the truth and obey the law of God’s kingdom shall be restored to perfect health in body and mind, be provided with homes and plenty, and dwell in peace and prosperity upon the earth for ever. For this reason those who have believed the Bible have looked forward with great expectation to the time of God's kingdom on earth. That time is here and now Jehovah sends forth His witnesses with His message of truth that the people might learn and be comforted and have hope. The importance of this message, therefore, cannot be overstated.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Opposers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It is these humble men and women who love God and righteousness, and who as His witnesses are going from house to house with His message of hope, that are abused, arrested and persecuted. They are being thus wrongfully treated because they are the representatives and servants of Jehovah and are messengers of peace concerning His righteous government. It was Satan the Devil who induced man to sin. Satan is the opposer of God and of righteousness and has long been the invisible ruler of the governments of this world. lie declared his ability to induce all creation to turn against Jehovah. God accepted Satan's challenge, at the same time declaring that He would in His own due time establish a righteous government on earth under Christ, which righteous government would completely destroy Satan’s rule. For this reason He declared that He would put enmity between Satan and the seed of God's kingdom. The issue was thus joined and since has been: “Who is supreme, Jehovah God or Satan?’’ Jehovah has permitted Satan to go his limit in wickedness and misrule and oppression of the people, and now the end thereof has come. Satan knows this, and he uses his every power to blind the people to the truth and turn them against Jehovah God. Jehovah now sends forth His witnesses to serve notice upon the rulers of the world of His purpose shortly to destroy Satan's rule and organization, and He commands His witnesses to tell the people the good news of their complete deliverance and blessing that shall shortly follow by and through the administration of His righteous government under Christ. Satan the Devil and all his agents therefore violently oppose those who represent Jehovah God and His kingdom, and for this reason Jehovah’s witnesses are being persecuted and thrown into prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In proof of the fact that Satan the Devil has long been and is the invisible prince or ruler of the nations of this world, and has induced his earthly representatives to persecute the servants of Jehovah God, I submit the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus was a mere babe the then ruler of Palestine attempted to kill Him. That ruler was a representative of the Devil. Had he been a representative of God he would not have tried to kill God's beloved Son Jesus. When Jesus began His earthly ministry, as the Scriptures set forth, Satan tried to induce Jesus to violate God's law and thereby bring about His own destruction. Failing in this he set about to cause Jesus to be persecuted in every possible manner. Jesus the Holy and Righteous One was accused and charged with almost every crime known to the calendar. Finally lie was arrested upon a false charge, and without warrant, haled before a corrupt and prejudiced court, unlawfully tried and convicted upon hired and perjured testimony, and wickedly put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just a few days before His death Jesus told His disciples, as is set forth in the fourteenth chapter of John, that He would shortly be violently taken away and that Satan the prince or invisible ruler of this world would be the chief actor in that crime. At the same time Jesus said to His faithful followers, as recorded in John 15: ‘Because I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember this, the servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you.’ The indisputable facts show that from that day till now every person who has been true and faithful in his service to God as a follower of Christ Jesus has suffered persecution at the hands of rulers and hypocritical religionists, who are Satan’s agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is stated, in 2 Corinthians 4, that Satan is the god or invisible ruler of the nations of this world and that he makes every effort to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. The visible rulers of the world are, to wit: Big Business that robs the people and corrupts the politicians; the professional politicians that yield to improper influence for selfish reasons; and big preachers or religious leaders. These last named are the chief representatives of Satan on earth, for the reason that they claim to teach the Bible but neither believe it nor teach it. They have used the Bible and religion as a screen behind which Big Business and corrupt politicians have operated their misrule. Instead of teaching the people the Bible truths, the clergy have used all their influence to keep the people in ignorance thereof. Every place where Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested and persecuted this has been done at the instance of preachers, either by directing the police officers to make such arrests or by inducing some member of their flock to cause the arrest. The fundamental law of America provides that there shall be no alliance between church and state; but such alliance does in fact exist. At Asbury Park Jehovah’s witnesses were informed by an official in the city office, acting in an official capacity, that they could not go from house to house with their Bible books until they had first received a permit duly approved by the ministers or clergymen of the town. Ocean Grove is chartered as a religious corporation, and it was there that the ministerial or clergy company that controls the city recently caused the arrest of men because they were preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. If these alleged offenders had been going from house to house selling bread or meat, would those clergymen have interested themselves and caused their arrest? Most assuredly not. But when these men go to the people with the message of truth of and concerning Jehovah God’s kingdom they immediately become offenders and violators of the law in the eyes of the clergymen who hypocritically claim to preach God's Word. And why? Because the clergymen do not want the people to know and to understand the truth. Judge, then, whom they represent, God or Satan !</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As an evidence that the clergy do not wish the people to hear the truth, only yesterday a number of Jehovah’s witnesses, while distributing in the town of Bergenfield only an announcement of this radio chain broadcast, were arrested and thrown into prison and held until they could be bailed out. Without a doubt this was done at the instance of the Catholic priests, who think it is their business to direct how the town should be governed and who shall hear the truth and who shall not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, it will be said that surely the ministers or clergymen would not be opposed to the proclamation of the truth as contained in the Bible. The facts show, however, that they are the chief opposers and the ones who induce the strong arm of the law to interfere with the spreading of the truth contained in the Bible. Should the true followers of Christ Jesus be surprised at the clergymen's conduct? No, rather should they accept it, for the reason that it has ever been thus since Jesus’ time. The Pharisees or priests were the clergy at the time Jesus was on earth. Those clergymen made loud claims that they represented God, just as the clergymen of the present time claim to represent God. The persecutors of Jesus were those same clergymen. After they had made repeated attempts to kill Jesus He confronted them and told those clergymen, who claimed to be the seed of Abraham and representatives of God, that they were in fact the representatives of the Devil. I quote the language of Jesus appearing at John 8:40-45: “But now ye seek to kill me. a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.&quot;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the clergymen today who induce the people to burn the books which contain God's message of truth, and it is the same class of clergymen who cause the arrest and persecution and imprisonment of Jehovah's witnesses who bear the message of truth to the people. Jesus definitely identified them and marked them as the seed or representatives of the Devil, and the opposers of God and Ilis kingdom. For that reason Jehovah's witnesses are persecuted by these hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have no desire to do injury to any man. I am not seeking a controversy with the clergymen, nor with anyone else, but when men who pose before the people as God's representatives and ministers of Christ, call to their aid the strong-arm scpiad of the law to prevent the people from receiving the truth at the hands of Jehovah's true witnesses, then it becomes my duty to use plainness of speech that the people may have a proper understanding of the issue. I charge that the clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant, are deliberately hindering the people from receiving the truth and hence are keeping the people in ignorance of the real cause of the distress that is now upon the world and what is the true remedy therefor. In doing this the clergymen call to their aid officers of the law, who are allied with them, to arrest and imprison Jehovah’s witnesses and do injury to all the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah's witnesses, in obedience to God's commandment, are now telling the people the truth as contained in the Bible, to wit, that the kingdoms of this world are oppressive because Satan is the invisible ruler, and that within a short time God will completely destroy Satan's organization, and that a righteous rule under Christ is the only hope for the world, and that God's kingdom of righteousness will bring peace, prosperity, happiness, liberty, and everlasting life to the peoples of the earth, and that the obedient ones shall then dwell for ever on the earth. The clergymen deny that such truth is contained in the Bible. The people have a right to know, and must therefore have a right to hear, whether or not this is truth. If the message Jehovah’s witnesses are bringing to the people is true, then it is of the greatest importance to mankind. If it is false, then it is the duty of the clergymen who thus claim to come boldly forward and plainly tell the people wherein that message is false. The radio is the best means to thus reach the people at large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I therefore invite the organization known as the Federation of Churches of Christ in America, together with all Catholic and Protestant organizations, to confer together and to jointly agree upon and select one man to be their spokesman in a nation-wide debate by radio. Let them pay one half of the expense. Jehovah’s witnesses will supply the money for the other half. Jehovah’s witnesses will select a man to be their spokesman in this debate. Give the people a fair opportunity to hear and to determine for themselves what is the truth. I charge that the clergymen are hindering the people from learning the truth, and I therefore name the following issues for debate, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved, (1) That the clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant, do not represent Jehovah God and Christ, but that they do represent and serve Satan the Devil;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) That the clergymen do not teach the people the truth as contained in the Bible concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom, and that therefore they and their church organizations are a detriment to the best interests of the people;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(3) That the Scriptures clearly teach that within the present generation Jehovah God will completely destroy Satan's organization, including present governments on earth, and that only those people who seek meekness and righteousness by taking their stand on the side of God and His kingdom may hope to be saved in that trouble, and that those who do serve and obey the law of God’s kingdom will be granted everlasting life on earth in peace and prosperity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(4) That those who are opposed to the message which Jehovah’s witnesses are now carrying to the people by radio and in printed form are fighting against God and will receive a just recompense at the hands of the Lord for so doing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">I ask this radio audience to demand that the clergymen accept this challenge and arrange for this debate or else to admit to the people that they are wrong and to cease for ever from the persecution of Jehovah's witnesses. Let all who are for or against Jehovah’s witnesses write a letter to me, in care of your station, demanding that such public discussion be had in the interest of the people. I will furnish these letters to the public press, that the people may know what is being done.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Right</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses claim the right to preach the gospel of God's kingdom by carrying the printed message from house to house because it is a God-given right. Recognizing that no state or municipality could properly interfere with that right, the framers of the Constitution of the United States inserted therein the provision for religious freedom and that it is the right and privilege of everyone to worship God in his own way without interference or hindrance. No state, city or municipality can enact and enforce a law that contravenes the Constitution of the United States. Jehovah’s witnesses do not ask permission to preach the gospel because of such constitutional right, but they do claim and insist that the fundamental law of the nation and states completely estops all law officers and others from rightfully interfering with the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in so preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has commanded His witnesses now on earth to declare the day of His vengeance upon Satan’s organization and to preach the good news of His kingdom for the comfort of those that mourn. Some of these positive commandments as set forth in the Bible, I quote: (Isaiah 43:12) “Ye are mv witnesses . . . that I am God.” (Psalm 145:20) ‘All the wicked God will destroy.’ (Isaiah 61:2) ‘Declare the day of the vengeance of God.’ This means that those who have agreed to do the will of God must tell the people that Jehovah is God, that the Devil and his organization are God’s enemies and will be destroyed for the relief of mankind. “Christendom” is that religious element that fraudulently claims to represent Christ but which in fact is a part of Satan’s organization. To His witnesses Jehovah gives this commandment, as recorded in Ezekiel 3: 8-11: ‘Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. As an adamant, harder than flint, have I made thy forehead; fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house. And go, speak to them and tell them, Thus saith the Lord, Whether they hear or refuse to hear.’ In Matthew 24 the commandment is given to preach the gospel and then it states that when this witness work is done there shall immediately follow the worst trouble that the world has ever known. It is to Jehovah’s witnesses that the testimony of Jesus Christ has been committed, and for this reason Satan and his agents attempt to destroy them and their work. This is plainly stated in Revelation 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The apostles of Jesus were ordered out of town, persecuted and imprisoned because they preached the gospel at that time. Peter, one of the defendants in that case, replied to the court: ‘Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than to God, judge ye. . . . We will obey God, and not man? (Acts 4:19: 5:29) So now say Jehovah’s witnesses to those who would hinder them in preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In all kindness, but with firmness and without fear of man or devil, I now say to the judges of the courts, to the police officers, and to the hypocritical clergymen and their henchmen who attempt to hide behind the law of the land, that Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom in the manner and by the means which Jehovah God has provided and commanded and thus they will do at the cost of their own lifeblood if necessary. The time has arrived for the great issue as to who shall rule the world, Jehovah or Satan, to be settled, and this issue must be for ever settled. God will settle it right, and before doing so it is His will and command that notice of His purpose shall be served upon the rulers and the message be given for the comfort of the people. What is puny man, that he can fight against Jehovah God? As human creatures Jehovah's witnesses are of small importance, but Jehovah and His kingdom are of supreme importance. Jehovah God is sending forth Uis message by His witnesses. He who opposes will do so at his peril. Let all such take warning. If you officers of the law wish to be further tricked by the hypocritical clergymen and thus induced to stop the proclamation of God’s message of truth by arresting, persecuting and imprisoning Jehovah’s witnesses, you must take the responsibility. You will not take it, however, without due notice. As one of Jehovah’s witnesses I now remind you of the counsel given at Psalm 2: 8-12. Jehovah there declares His purpose to destroy all who oppose the forward march of His kingdom, and then adds: ‘Be wise now, therefore, O ye kings [rulers] ; be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling; . . . lest ye perish when his wrath is kindled but a little.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I advise all people who love righteousness and who desire to see righteousness established in the earth to now take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and llis kingdom under Christ. That the people might be informed as to what to do, Jehovah’s witnesses are coining to you with the message of God's truth in book form. If possible provide yourself with these books and together with your Bible learn of God, because it is written, in John 17:3, that all who will ever get life everlasting must know God and Christ and obey the law of llis kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am reliably informed that the organized clergy of America have expressed their determination to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. A clergyman at Asbury Park recently made this statement: “All of this bunch [Jehovah’s witnesses] should be put in jail and Judge Rutherford should be electrocuted.” Satan and his agents have declared war against those whom Jehovah God sends forth to boar His testimony. Let them do their worst. He who is for us is stronger than all that can be against us. To Jehovah’s witnesses, my brethren, I therefore speak calling attention to His commandment given them as recorded in Zephaniah 3:16, which says: Tn that day fear not, and let not thine hands be slack.’ Proceed with your work of bearing God’s testimony to the people regardless of what the enemy may do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today there are millions of people in the land of “Christendom” who are of good will and who sigh and cry because of the abominable and unchristian things done by the clergy in the churches and outside of them. Remember God’s commandments given to you as set forth in Ezekiel 9:4, which says: ‘Go through the midst of “Christendom” and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.’ This marking upon the foreheads is giving the people an intelligent understanding of God’s purposes by putting them in contact with His message of truth. Millions of good people are in sore distress because they see the clergy repudiating the Bible and conniving at the destruction of those faithful men and women who teach the Bible. The good people are in great need of the truth and they want to hear it. I bid you, therefore, go forth in the full confidence, trust and strength of Jehovah God, and lift up His standard for the people, that they may see the true way of relief and deliverance for them and that you may have some part in the vindication of the great and holy name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THE LETTERS AND TELEGRAMS RECEIVED ; ORIGINALS ARE ON FILE IN OUR OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Camden, N. J. (Addressed to Federal Council of Churches) “I am sure you are aware of the fact that a challenge was offered to you, with Jehovah’s witnesses, by Judge J. F. Rutherford. Why not accept this and have it out, as they will pay half of the expenses? I urge you to accept the same, that the people at large may be enabled to know which is the truth.” W. I. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Maybrook, N. Y. “We heartily approve of your challenge for a debate. You have nothing to lose, and all to gain. The organized churches and clergymen are as large criminals as the gangster, to stand by and allow any officer of the law to arrest a person for distributing literature pertaining to the Bible, which is the Word of truth. These people are within their constitutional rights and should not be molested. The clergymen and the police who have acted illegally are the ones that should be put in the dungeon. Continue on in defiance of this band of racketeers.” Mr. and Mrs. E. B. Ivyland, Pa. “Would welcome a debate with Federation of Churches. Heard your talk last Sunday and think it dreadful that one cannot speak his own mind without being thrown in jail.” Mrs. H. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. (Addressed to Gimbel Brothers) “I heard the Watchtower program on your station yesterday and enjoyed it immensely. Rutherford certainly has the goods on those ministers. I think he is right in everything he said. Be sure and arrange for that debate which he offered. That will be real interesting. I have some of the Watchtower publications and I find more truth and common sense in them than all the churches put together.” W. M. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cambridge, Mass. (Addressed to Station WNAC) “The address by Judge Rutherford this morning seemed to me a masterpiece. I do not happen to be a church-goer, but these Jehovah’s witnesses, as they call themselves, appear to have something that the other churches do not have. I would like to listen to a debate as suggested by Judge Rutherford this morning. Whatever a man’s religion is, there is only </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font6"> truth.” II. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Woburn, Mass. “I am an old fellow, practically out of the race, physically weak but mentally stronger than ever. You have spoken fundamental truths. I certainly would like a debate, just to find on what grounds anyone dares to interfere with followers of God, whoever and wherever they be. My faith is tolerance; I have no sect or creed. As our Lord ■was persecuted, so are His followers.” O. D. V. Boston, Mass. “I was very much surprised to hear that the so-called ‘ministers of the gospel’ are willing to put you in the electric chair for such a righteous cause as you stand for. They ought to hang themselves, and I believe they will. Anxiously awaiting the debate. More power to you.” A. N. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Woodbury, N. J. “We listened to your talk yesterday over station WIP. It was the best we ever heard, and we would both love to hear the debate which you challenged the clergy to take up. We have read some of your books and think they are great. We both wish you well, and may the Lord bless you for the good you are doing.” Mr. and Mrs. L. D. E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cambridge, Mass. “Your hundreds of thousands of listeners are no doubt grieved deeply to hear of the treatment of those brave men and •women who have been so ill-treated at the hands of these unprincipled whelps. Keep up the good work, Judge, and the good Lord will bless and reward you manifold, as well as your splendid assistants.” J. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jersey City, N. J. “Thank you for explaining over the radio this morning ‘Why Jehovah’s witnesses Persecuted?’ I send this letter to you to tender to the public press, to have them ask the clergy of ‘Christendom’ to have a nation-wide debate about the Bible. I am not a member of your organization, but believe in Jehovah God. Your books, which you distribute for so little, are a great help in understanding the Bible and the purposes of God’s kingdom on earth.” L. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. “I listened to your remarkable lecture on the radio yesterday; it was wonderful, and I would like to hear your debate with the ministers and priests. If they can put up anything as sensible as that it certainly will be great. Let us have the debate, by all means.” M. II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Camden, Me. “I had the extreme pleasure of listening to you last Sunday and I sincerely approve of your plan to call the bluff of the clergy in their dastardly way of trying to prevent the delivery of the Word of God to the people that are hungering for it. It is the work of Satan's organization, and I will be glad when the time comes that he is tied up in chains and put where he will not be able to do any more harm to the human race.” E. T. McC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Killingworth, Conn. “We listened to your wonderful service on the radio today. This was not the first time; we have listened to it many times. We also have eight or ten of your books and find them very interesting. I just wanted to write and say that we would greatly appreciate a debate on the radio between Jehovah’s witnesses and the Federal Council of Churches. I think it would enlighten many people and show up what most of the churches are. I am so sorry’ to hear that our state was one included in the persecution of your people. I hope that when the debate is on we will also hear about it, so that we can listen in. We live away<sup>7</sup> out in the country and do not get our mail more than once or twice a week.” Mrs. K. R. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lake Como, N. J. “I listened to you this morning. Yes, by<sup>7</sup> all means, I agree there must be freedom for all religions. I too agree that if the ministers, both Protestant and Romanist, would preach the coming of our Lord, the country would profit by it. I do not think they read their Bible. If they do, their eyes are blinded by<sup>7</sup> Satan. I wish you success in your work for Jehovah.” L. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paterson, N. J. “I heard your radio lecture Sunday<sup>7</sup> ‘Why Jehovah’s witnesses Persecuted?’ and your challenge to the leaders of‘organized Christianity<sup>7</sup>’ to a radio debate. At a time like this, when there is so much confusion and misunderstanding, it would be most appropriate if the religious leaders of Christianity would come out in the open and demonstrate or prove their right to continue as leaders and instructors of the people.” M. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Audubon, N. J. “We feel greatly blessed that we were among those who were able to hear* your voice over the radio yesterday. May God give you more power to carry on your good work. Who are Jehovah’s witnesses in our vicinity? It would be a blessing and great privilege to meet them.” Mr. and Mrs. L. 13. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Telford, Pa. “I listened to all of your address at 10: 00 a.m. over station WIP. I agree. Anyone that thinks you are committing wrongs should be glad for the opportunity to debate with you. I am a member of a church, but I do want a square deal for all. That is what Jesus taught us.” H. N. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Preakness, N. J. “I am very much for the debate. I am for Jehovah's Government.” Mrs. C. N. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Atlantic City, N. J. “Your lecture came in over WPG wonderfully without a break in the program. Here is hoping the debate goes on the air against the Devil’s most capable representative that he can select.” J. L. E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long Island City, N. Y. “After listening to your most inspiring and comforting message over the radio I am firmly resolved from today to sever my connections from all religious organizations. If a Catholic priest can utter such a remark as ‘Electrocute Judge Rutherford’ I can plainly see the hatred in his heart, and I can also understand that he has forgotten the fourth commandment, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ Keep up your good work. Consider me one who is in favor of a debate, and if the time comes and I am financially able I want to contribute toward the expense of the debate. You can use this letter for your contemplated publication.” W. II. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brookline, Mass. “We express our sympathy for you and your loyal witnesses. Is it not possible to sue for false arrest ? Surely such terrible action on the part of the Romanist priest will not go unpunished. Surely the fall of the Roman tyrants is near at hand, judging from reports from Spain and Mexico. We are unable to help but little on account of great losses recently, but should your faithful witnesses call at our door a small amount will be ready. Or, shall I send it along? We were greatly inspired by your beautifully expressed broadcast, as were many other listeners’, and we are looking forward to hear you speak God’s message next Sunday.” Mr. and Mrs. E. D. and son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Westwood, Mass. “Say, Judge, if the Federation of Churches ignore your challenge or fail to come on the radio with you, they are hypocrites and cowards. I have said many times that the world would be bettei* off without the churches, and if they ignore your challenge I shall fully believe I was right. Here is a dollar to help on the expense of the debate.” G. E. IL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">East Williston, N. Y. “I have for a long time been a listener to your radio lectures and learned from them many things I did not know. Your challenge to the ministry last Sunday struck me as being one of the best means of putting the issues forcibly and plainly before the people. I am sending herewith a check which represents one-tenth of a sum I recently received, to help defray the expense of your proposed radio debate, or you might use it in any other way you see fit in spreading the good news of God’s kingdom.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">R. G. W. </span><span class="font6">Norwich, Conn. (Addressed to station WCAP, Asbury Park) “This morning I heard over your station, and enjoyed in particular, the program put on by the Watchtower. I find these Bible talks very interesting and educational. My father was born, lived and died a Catholic. My mother was a Lutheran, and I was brought up in that faith. But in all the years I was with my parents I never learned from either my father or my mother, nor from the Lutheran church, the wonderful truths, and the interesting explanations of Bible prophecy, that I have heard from Judge Rutherford.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hawthorne, N. J. “Your masterful address championing the cause of Jehovah’s witnesses came in clear and strong. The time has come for the people to know Jehovah, and also those who represent Him. We therefore trust that the leaders of ‘organized Christianity’ will accept your challenge to a radio debate. They have fooled the public long enough. We hope they will have backbone enough to come out in the open.” C. R. II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arlington, Mass. “Your ringing challenge to Satan’s crowd great cause for rejoicing.” AV. B. F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shelburne Falls, Mass. “Reception excellent; back you in challenge.” J. G. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Washington, D. C. “Lecture thrilling. Every word distinct. Many thanks. We request debate.” A. F. and AV. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">North Pembroke, Mass. (Addressed to station AVNAC) “I was much interested in the lecture given by Judge Rutherford over &quot;WNAC Sunday May 1, sponsored by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. lie was some speaker. He certainly put forth some challenge to the whole world of mankind in every walk of life, and to the clergy to give their time against bis in a debate to prove lie is wrong or for ever to hold their peace. Now if the systems he mentioned, namely Big Business, the guardians of the law, and the clergy, will have the courage<sup>1</sup> he had and get on the air and give us the debate he called for, perhaps we can rid our minds of a lot of hate and worry and come into a perfect harmony, with peace as a result. If no debate is forthcoming, it will prove to the whole world that this man is wholly right in his declaration, and that, as he said, we are walking around with a ringin our nose, led by a lot of hypocrites and bloodsuckers. It is about time we had someone to say something for humanity, and he has the real courage to stand for what is right. And who dares to even try to prove he is wrong? I am just another taxpayer and I guess we got the truth from this man. At least, he has the courage to tell the truth. Let us have the debate of the aforesaid challenge. I will be listening further for the wheels of understanding.” A. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Devon, Conn. “We enjoyed your broadcast on May 1 from W1CC, Bridgeport, Conn., very much. &quot;Would be very pleased indeed to hear such a debate as you mentioned, and deem it of real public interest and an absolute necessity that such a debate should be held, that the people might be able to see the contrast. The cpiestions involved will probably prove to be too much for the Federal Council of Churches, but our hope is that they will have backbone enough to come out in the open and face the challenge.” Mr. and Mrs. J. A. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Walden, Mass. “Your lecture of Sunday, May 1, was certainly thrilling, and if the Federation of Churches have anything to dispute they now have the opportunity to come forward and accept your offer of a debate. I am very anxious to see this debate come through, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">would be willing to contribute a little money toward the expense of it. If you will accept money toward a fund for that purpose, please advise me and I will send in my donation.” Lavallette, N. J. (Addressed to station WPG) “I would like to say a word about the Watchtower programs that I have been listening to over your station for some time. I enjoy listening to them more than any other programs you put on the air, and am very glad to know that your management is not under the thumb of the clergy, as is evidently the case with the big NBC chain of stations. It is a great wonder to me that the officials of many towns such as Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, South Amboy and Bergenfield, N. J., have not ‘wised up’ to the fact that they are being made the ‘goat’ for the clergy, when they go so far as to try to suppress religious freedom by the arrest of men and women who teach only the Bible teachings. Do these officials forget the fundamental principles of the constitutions of our state and country ? I heard Judge Rutherford's personal challenge to the clergy and Federal Council of Churches over your station last Sunday morning. I do not see how they can ignore this challenge.” G. D. II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. “I venture to state that the lecture broadcast by you on Sunday last, May 1, was the most fearless lecture ever delivered by any man over the air, barring none. I heartily endorse all that was said. Surely the treatment Jehovah’s witnesses have been and are receiving is a disgrace to the civilization and good name of the United States of America. I sincerely hope that the challenge made by you to the Federation of Churches will be taken up by them. I strongly urge that the proposed debate be arranged for the near future and be broadcast over a circuit of radio stations, half the expense to be borne by the Federation of Churches.” P. N. Z. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jersey City, N. J. “Having listened with keenest interest to your radio broadcast of May 1 I wish to express my sincere appreciation of the bold and fearless stand which you have taken against all the sham and hypocrisy now posing before the people in the guise of religion. The persecution of Jehovah's witnesses has caused much perplexity in the; minds of many good, honest people, and I therefore submit that your challenge for a debate with a representative of the church federation is timely and of the greatest importance. I cast my vote in favor of yourself as the representative of Jehovah's witnesses in such a debate.” J. Y. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Beading, Pa. “I listened to your talk over the radio on the subject ‘Why Jehovah’s witnesses Persecuted?’ with great interest. When wickedness is so great, surely there is some reason for it. I have all your hooks. I wish to say they are a wonderful help. I heard you issue a challenge to all the clergymen to debate, but I doubt whether your challenge will be accepted. If not, I wish to encourage you to take legal steps to force them to stop causing the arrest of these witnesses who go from door to door with the message of God's kingdom.” E. P. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bywood, Pa. (Addressed to station WFAN) “Relative to the challenge issued by Judge Rutherford to the various creeds of ‘Christendom’ for a debate covering the truth of the statements he made in last Sunday’s broadcast over your station: The people are weary unto death with the multitude of doctrines. Judge Rutherford bases every statement he makes upon the only infallible guide we have, the Bible, and unless the ministers, priests and others who claim to teach God’s word accept that challenge, the masses will know they have been misled and deceived, and church-ianity will collapse in utter ruin. This is a serious matter; it is imperative that the people know who is right, who wrong. We demand that this challenge be accepted, no more side-stepping. 'We want the truth.” P. H. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Washington, D. C. “After hearing your lecture, given over station WPG, Atlantic City, N.J., setting forth a clear, concise statement of facts, as they exist today, and calling upon the radio audience for an expression of their sentiments, I wish to state that I am heartily in favor of a debate in order that the whole world may know the facts and what the Scriptures plainly teach.” J. F. J.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. (Addressed to station WIP) “I was extremely pleased and interested by the Watchtower program of yesterday. It was one that certainly ought to make all people, honest and dishonest alike, sit up and take notice. Accordingly, I certainly agree that the clergy should accept the challenge and show the public in general where they stand in these very important matters or else admit that they are in the wrong and want to dishonestly and hypocritically roost under cover while they have others, police and judges, do their dirty work for them.” F. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Huntington, Pa. “I am very much surprised to hear that the clergymen of this country have had the nerve to interfere with the preaching of God’s Word, and am very glad that Judge Rutherford had the nerve to stand up and tell the people the truth about the matter. Without a doubt it is a splendid idea to bring before the people both sides of the question, in order that they may see the truth. Let someone come forth and meet this great challenge, or keep quiet and admit it is the truth. Truth is what the people need to know, and it never was as important to reveal it as it is now.” J. P. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lakewood, R. I. “Your program of May 1 was well received and we enjoyed it very much. We agree with you that a debate should be had on the subject you stated, and would like to hear it.” G. E. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn, X. Y. “Your address of last Sunday morning, ‘Why Jehovah's witnesses Persecuted ?’ Heard over WBBR, was much appreciated. Your challenge to the Federal Council of Churches to a nation-wide radio debate is a challenge which unquestionably they must openly meet in some way or lose what little respect they may have with the audience that was fortunate enough to listen to you. I hope that this debate can be brought about, and without a doubt it will be for the best interests and convenience of the radio public. A debate of this kind without the frills and mob outbursts of a visible audience can but appeal favorably to the common sense of the listeners. They will not be handicapped or prejudiced by their fellow listeners, for in most instances they will be hearing the debate alone, or with other members of the family, and thus be better able to personally think over what is said.” R. J. IT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Germantown, Pa. (Addressed to station WIP) “It was my privilege to enjoy a Watchtowek broadcast of Judge Rutherford this morning between ten and eleven a.m. Permit me to endorse the idea expressed by Judge Rutherford of a national radio debate with those who oppose the work of Jehovah’s witnesses at this time. Let those who desire to oppose this work now come out into the open and present to the people their proof that they represent Jehovah God and support His Word, the Bible. If they are unable to submit proof, then let them forever hold their peace.” R. J. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn, N. Y. ‘‘Your speech of May 1 on ‘Why Jehovah’s witnesses Persecuted&quot;?’ thrilled me. Your challenge to the representatives of so-called ‘organized religion’ certainly seems a fair one. The people should hear the truth. I am for the debate you proposed.” A. K. AV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bridgeport, Conn. (Addressedto Station WICC) ‘‘We listened in on the special program over your station Sunday, May 1, 1932, at ten o’clock, and became intensely interested in what the speaker’ had to say. It was the most thrilling talk we have heard in some time and we are anxious to know if your station will be included in the national hookup the speaker mentioned. We are losing faith in the clergymen as teachers and leaders of the spiritual affairs of the people and would appreciate any literature you care to send about this man Rutherford and what he stands for. It seems good to hear a speaker expose the hypocrisy that seems to be behind the churchmen of today and to hear the Bible cproted in such a practical way. We hope WICC continues to champion the cause of the common people.” Mr. and Mrs. J. AV. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Phillipsburg, N. J. “I am very much interested in the lecture given over station AVIP last Sunday, as to why Jehovah's witnesses are persecuted. To me it seems inconceivable that anyone should object to the message taken to the people as is being done by these in the interest of their fellow men. I join you in the request that this matter be debated over the radio by the representative of Jehovah’s witnesses and a representative of the church federation.” F. E. McP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everett, Mass. (Addressed to station AA'NAC) “I listened to Judge Rutherford's lecture over your station yesterday with profound and thrilling interest. He has a message for the people which should be heralded widely. I shall be most interested to hear the debate of which he made mention. His offer evidences sincerity and conviction on his part, and I trust those to whom he extended the invitation will be as equally broad and unprejudiced in their response to his invitation, or challenge. May I congratulate your station for lending your support in the broadcast of such an outstanding message at such a crucial hour. Others have spoken to me of their marked interest in the lecture. Could you broadcast more of his lectures ?” G. M. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. “Your lecture over AVIP May 1 was wonderful. As you suggest, to have a debate over the radio with one of these clergymen to prove which is right would be the very thing. These clergymen remind me of sparrows. There are plenty of them around, they cannot sing, only chirp, and eat everything in sight. I hope they get their wings clipped soon.” L. M. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Easton, Pa. “T listened in on your lecture over the air yesterday and was amazed to learn that men and women are being persecuted for their belief in the Bible in this our enlightened age, and especially in the states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, supposed to rank very high in Christianity, education and refinement. I enjoyed your talk throughout, and was especially impressed with the idea of having a debate over the air. If the churches believe the Bible, and understand it, then they ought to tell the people something about God's purposes, and thus bring comfort to them in these terribly distressing times. If they do not understand the Bible or believe that God is going to bring relief tc the groaning creation, then the people should know it, so that they may pay attention to those who put forth an honest effort to teach them. I do hope that this debate will be forthcoming.” C. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yonkers, N. Y. “In view of the confusion that exists in the world today, I am heartily in accord with Judge Rutherford’s challenge to the clergy for a debate on the subject mentioned by him Sunday morning, May 1. If the clergy are honest and have the welfare of the people at heart, they will accept.” II. J. 0.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Olney, Pa. “In times of war the clergy are in favor of war. In times of peace they favor peace. Now that Air. Rutherford has exposed their duplicity I would appreciate hearing a debate between him and one of theii* representatives.” A. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Malden, Mass. “As one of the many listeners-in on Judge Rutherford’s broadcast today, I would like to see a fulfilment of his request for a debate between the federation of churches representative and one chosen by Jehovah's witnesses. This is a question vital to the people today. His lecture was certainly a masterpiece. The truth is what all real men and women should wish to hear at this time, and they certainly are not getting it in the church systems.” AA<sup>7</sup>. H. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn, N. Y. “I heard your lecture Sunday morning, May 1, over radio station WBBR, bringing up an issue that has caused considerable controversy in this area. Regardless of my personal beliefs or prejudices I think the position that you have taken in this issue is just and fair. It makes a provision for the people as a whole to hear both sides of this argument. If the clergy who condemn you and the teachings of your organization so vehemently have a Scriptural ground for their position, they should have no difficulty in choosing a man who could champion their position on a radio hook-up such as you suggest. I would be intensely interested in hearing such a debate, and if I may be permitted to make a suggestion, I would like to suggest that you yourself be the representative of Jehovah’s witnesses in this issue. Therefore, in the interest of fair play and for the benefit of the people who are anxious to know the truth, I sincerely hope that this debate can be arranged.” T. J. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">North Quincy, Mass. (Addressed to station WNAC) “I wish to state that I listened in to Judge Rutherford’s lecture this morning over your station and was very much impressed. I would be glad to hear the nation-wide debate that was suggested by the speaker, if it can be arranged. Surely 'organized Christianity’ should be glad to take up the issue. Certainly they cannot afford to let this challenge go unaccepted. Questions such as those raised by Judge Rutherford should be settled in the minds of the people; and what better way could be used than a radio debate?” G. F. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Haledon, N. J. “Your very interesting lecture was very much appreciated by me. Your challenge to those who set themselves up as the spiritual leaders of the people is very timely. I say, Let the clergy come out in the open and prove their right to continue as such, leaving all fair-minded people to be the judges as to what is truth in this day of trouble and distress upon the nations.” L. 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Haverhill, Mass. “I wish to go on record as endorsing your proposition to the clergy that they appoint one of their number to discuss with you over the radio the reasons why or why not this most vital matter concerning the establishment of God's righteous kingdom upon the earth should not now be presented to the people.” A. M. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Darby, Pa. “I want to thank you for the fearless lecture which you gave over WIP on Sunday, May 1. It is what this country needs very badly: the Truth. I would like to see a debate between you and some of the advocates of the sects; it would show them up in their true colors. They get good money for trying to perpetuate Dark Age lies, which only does the people harm. More power to you in your spread of the truth of the Bible. I shall be glad to assist in any way possible to bring about a debate which would show up the clergy and their crooked bedfellows, the politicians and financiers.” A. V. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. “The amazing disclosures, in your radio lecture yesterday morning, of the intolerant activities of the modern Pharisees, impel me to join in what I hope will be a veritable flood of protests against their operations. Regardless of what one’s religious tendencies may be, no one appreciating our Constitutional provisions for freedom of worship can stand idly by while these guarantees are imperiled. I endorse fully your demand that the clergy either cease their efforts to hinder Jehovah's witnesses from performing what they construe to be their proper devotions to God, or that they debate with you the questions at issue.” M. E. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Paterson, N. J. “Iliad the privilege of listening to your lecture of May 1, ‘Why Jehovah’s witnesses Persecuted ?’ I heartily agree with your challenge calling on the denominations to appoint one of their leaders to debate the question as to why they are persecuting these Christians who are preaching the Gospel from door to door, and prove their stand by the Scriptures.” V. K. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wilkes-Barre, Pa. (Addressed to radio station WIP) “We have been Watchtowek listeners for a couple of years, and we want to state at this point that we are anxious to dare any religious prognosticator to dare to take that challenge. We happened to be reared and horn Catholics.” J. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Philadelphia, Pa. “To say that we were thrilled with what you had to say, and particularly your challenge to the clergy, is putting it mildly. There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that the world is facing the worst crisis in history, and that the time has come for a show-down. Not only are the people in distress, but are being oppressed more and more and don't know where to turn for relief. The issue clearly is “Who is Jehovah?” and who are His representatives ? and therefore we demand that the preachers face the issue and through their chosen representative debate the subjects propounded by you this morning and let the people hear both sides of the question by means of an international hook-up, well advertised, 50 percent of the cost of same to be borne by the Federation of Churches. It is a fair challenge, and we would like to see it accepted, and, God willing, may you be chosen as His witness in the debate.” F. E. K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yonkers, X. Y. “Your broadcast heard over WBBR at ten o’clock this morning was just what is needed. If only you could compel the clergymen to declare themselves for or against God’s Word, what a wonderful thing that would he, a boon to humanity that cannot be overestimated! Not only do the clergymen hide behind civil authorities, but, what is still worse, they make use of the awful and ruthless weapon, fear, to force their respective followers to remain under them.” M. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rahway, N. J. “In answer to your invitation to write in, I am doing so. Your lecture was fine and you told them the truth. Yes, let them bring their wise men and put their case on the air. And their houses of worship will be desolate unto them that much quicker. I vote ‘Yes’ for a debate.” I). R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bridgeport, Conn. (Addressed to station WICC) “I wish to complement your staff for putting on such a wonderful broadcast as Judge Rutherford gave this morning. Is there not some way in which we could hear him more often? There was a roomful here and I am writing the sentiments of all present. We hope the challenge will be accepted by those mentioned, as it is about time we have a showdown. More power to Judge Rutherford and Jehovah’s witnesses, of whom he spoke.” M. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Revere, Mass, “I heard the broadcast by Judge Rutherford last Sunday and must say it was to the point. I would like nothing better than to know of someone that would accept the challenge, in the very near future, while the issue is fresh in the minds of the people.” H. R. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alden, Pa. “Your challenge to the Federated church systems to debate certain questions so vital to every one who claims to be a Christian should not be ignored. The charge made that the clergy are unfaithful and the whole church system is of the Devil is so strong that in justice to the church members the challenge should be accepted and a debate arranged for.” W. II. G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will&lt;es-Barre, Pa. “I listened with great interest and pleasure to your very enlightening lecture this morning over station WIP between 9: 00 and 10: 00 o’clock standard time. I am writing to endorse whole-heartedly the proposition that the religionists of ‘organized Christianity’ get together and choose a spokesman to debate the issues suggested over a nation-wide broadcast. I do not know that there could be a better method of enabling all parties and all people concerned to decide and act upon issues of such vital importance than to have the opportunity to hear them discussed from all angles. Trusting that your challenge for such a debate may result in the arranging of such an opportunity for the uncovering of erroi* and dispensing of truth, I remain, yours for truth, J. W. A.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reading, Pa. (Addressed to radio station WIP) “How my wife and I enjoyed the radio lecture of Judge J. F. Rutherford over your station this morning! There is a fearless man who knows the truth and has the courage to tell it. Please forward this letter to him, because we want to encourage him, and especially do we consider it important that a debate be arranged for as he suggested in his lecture this morning. This will bring out the facts, and that is what we want.” G. A. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Frankford, Pa. “Your frank Scriptural lecture of May 1 over WIP aroused in me a desire to hear a debate on the subject named. This would, it seems to me, be a great enlightenment to the people who still pay to have their thinking done for them by the clergy. The terms of the debate are fair, and the subject matter vital. I, for one, would be in favor of the debate, and sincerely hope these gentlemen are brave enough to accept your challenge.” I. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Milltown, N. B. “I have just listened to your* broadcast through WNAC, Boston. This is the most marvelous statement of truth, to my mind, which has ever gone over the air. The challenge sounded a death-note to the hypocritical rulers and their henchmen. I hope the warning will reach around the earth.” A. N. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New York, X. Y. “Listening to your most enlightening and instructive lecture Sunday I was impressed with the fact that you told me the truth as to what we need, and that is a government of righteousness. I was thrilled with your challenge Hung into the hypocritical preachers’ teeth to either give up or shut up, and I am one that wants to DEMAND that they answer your challenge and debate you or admit they are liars. I believe this is the THIRD TIME you have challenged these hypocrites, but they seem to fear you. Why ? Please do as you promised and let the public press know how the people feel about this; they want to know why the clergy do not take this up and tell the people the truth or admit they are hypocritical. Keep up the good work.” B. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hackensack, N. J. “Your lecture over the radio yesterday was one of the best I have heard you make. May God give you courage and strength to keep up the great witness work you are doing. It is my wish that your challenge be accepted to debate the questions you mentioned. Your arguments cannot be refuted. The opposition have no case, in my opinion, if they adhere to the Bible.” G. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wind Gap, Pa. “We listened in on your chain program Sunday, May 1, and found a world of comfort in your message. Also, we want to say that we are on Jehovah’s side and make a demand that the preachers prove their side or get out of the way.” J. L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mt. Vernon, N. Y. “I heard your address over the radio May 1. I am glad to send my letter of protest to you, and hope it will help save good, peace-loving people from being hunted like wild animals and thrown into jail.” A. C. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Springfield, Vt. “I am glad I sprained my ankle Saturday afternoon and stayed home from church Sunday, because I heard your program. I heard a while ago of one of your people being arrested for selling a Bible on Sunday, but did not know much about you before yesterday. This letter is to let you know that I'm for helping people to know the truth, as it is in the Bible, the one book we can depend on to tell no lies. I have known that the Catholic priests try to keep their people ignorant, as I've heard so many testimonies from converted Catholics and all of them were so happy that at last they had found the truth in spite of their priests.” A.

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>“John Doe” at Asbury Park</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">N INSPIRING thing happened at Asbury Park on March 27, the day when three hundred of Jehovah's witnesses called at every home in that city and in Ocean Grove, distributing Judge Rutherford’s books to those who are interested, contributors and others. Among these distributors was a certain young man who elects to remain nameless. We shall call him by his ‘‘legal” nom de plume, “John Doe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lie called at the home of a policeman who was off duty. After he had introduced himself as one of Jehovah's witnesses he told the officer that he had come to inform him that God's due time has come to provide the people with a righteous government that will bring them lasting peace, prosperity, health, happiness and everlasting life on earth. He told the officer that he was preaching the gospel or good news of the kingdom by putting books on the Bible in the hands of the people which books explain and prove the entire matter beyond any doubt, and that ho was giving tne people an opportunity to contribute money to help carry on this benevolent work. Phen he was asked by the policeman if he had a license. He replied that he was fully authorized to preach the gospel of Jehovah's kingdom. Thereupon the policeman invited him in. Our man declined, saying that he had other calls to make; and as he started to leave the porch, because he saw there was no interest for his message in that home, the officer reached out, very forcibly took him by the shoulder and pulled him into the house and ordered his wife to call police headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When locked up at police headquarters, for high moral reasons he declined to make his name known. His consistent answer to every inquiry on that point was, “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” He was denied bail and denied the right of consulting counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next day, when his lawyer made an effort to speak a few words with his client before the trial, he was brushed aside by a burly officer and rebuked by a husky policewoman, for they have women for such purposes in that highly religious city, that grotesquely amusing city, that city that is looking for trouble and gets what it is looking for, Asbury Park, that “dangerous place” (to use the words of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram)</span><span class="font6"> “founded several generations ago for* the God-fearing and named in honor of Bishop Asbury, Wesleyan clergyman who was the first Methodist bishop in this country”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The trial before the magistrate was set for nine o'clock, but did not begin until after ten. They were not quite through with their conspiracy against God’s servants at nine, for there was much conferring during that hour in the rear room of the court among the magistrate, the police chief of Asbury Park, the police chief and police justice of Ocean Grove, policemen, detectives and others who came and went. Finally the acting police judge of Asbury Park mounted the bench.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This “official”, Thomas L. Shebell, an Italian Roman Catholic, assumed an attitude of great haste. He obviously feared he would suffer a fate similar to Magistrate Tumen’s, whose viciousness and presumption on a previous occasion were exposed over several radio stations. In his fright Shebell made a desperate attempt to avoid furnishing any material for another exhibit of the Asbury Park police court, which had already become notorious enough. Throughout the proceedings he rode roughshod over all formalities, flung aside all good manners becoming a man, and attempted to jump over all legal fences. As a result of his folly he got caught in the barbed wire, and now this “guardian of the law” himself is exposed as utterly incompetent and a deliberate transgressor of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shebell demanded that the man plead guilty or not guilty. He remained silent, and the attorney appearing in his behalf informed the court </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font6"> the defendant stood mute. Thereupon the judge repeatedly demanded that the defendant give his name. Counsel respectfully responded, “The defendant stands mute, because this court has no jurisdiction, due to the complaint's being insufficient. It does not show the commission of an offense, and he is therefore not on trial at the present time. He doesn’t need to give his name.’’ But for this the judge maliciously imposed upon him a line of ten dollars for contempt of court, and then, at the last minute, apparently realizing he had gone too far in his hurry to dispose of the case, he re-ascended the bench after the trial had been closed and the court room cleared and revoked the fine imposed for contempt of court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Police Officer William Truex, who had made the arrest, was sworn, and testified falsely that when the defendant called at his home he displayed books /or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">sale.</span><span class="font6"> The policeman further deliberately and maliciously lied, testifying that he told “John Doe’’ to go away and tried to close the door, but that “John Doe’’ took hold of the knob, opened the door and walked into the house. Furthermore, on the witness stand the hypocrite was brazen enough to say, “It’s a pity that a man can't be safe in his own house anymore.” Ue is a burly policeman, and armed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When counsel for “John Doe” undertook to cross-examine the complaining officer, he was arbitrarily prohibited from doing so by the Court, and denied the right to be heard in any way in the matter. Without further evidence or circumstance, the Court found “John Doe” “guilty” and fined him two dollars. Because he refused to pay the fine, again on high moral grounds, he would have been compelled to spend ten days in jail, had not his attorney obtained temporary release by a writ of habeas corpus the day after his imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When, in a day or two, the matter was brought to a conclusion in the Court of Chancery at Newark, the vice-chancellor wisely and justly decided that “John Doe” (and the man remains nameless to this day) had been illegally restrained of his liberty because at the time of his arrest he was disseminating Bible truths, and, furthermore, that the trial was unconstitutional because the “due process” clauses of both the federal and state constitutions had been grossly violated. As a consequence “John Doe” is at liberty vigorously pursuing his lawful duties as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the clergy and the lying police and inefficient magistrates of Asbury Park are in the contempt in which they rightfully belong.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Wooden Heads in the Land of Wooden Nutmegs</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS hard to believe some of the things they do up in Connecticut. Now, take the story of the charter oak. Today nobody knows if there was one charter or were two that disappeared and mysteriously reappeared after the tyrant Andros had gone: nobody knows if the man who received the money for hiding the charter was the one who really made away with it from the darkened council room; and nobody knows if it was hid in one of the several private homes, or in an old elm, or in an oak. Yet there have been enough pieces of the charter oak sold to build an ark. See any good encyclopedia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course, the story about Connecticut Yankees’ making and trying to sell wooden nutmegs is only a joke, but some of their legislation, and state police administration, and judicial acts show that the historical interest in things wooden is not misplaced in the “land of steady habits”, but seems rather accentuated since the state became the birthplace of the Knights of Columbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be merely a coincidence that the Knights have their headquarters in Connecticut and that in that state in 1930 a law was passed that “no person shall solicit money, services, subscriptions or any valuable thing for any alleged religious, charitable or philanthropic cause, from other than a member of the organization for whose benefit such a person is soliciting or within the county in which such person or organization is located unless such cause shall have been approved by the secretary of the department of public welfare”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may or may not have been a coincidence, that the effect of such a law is to make the secretary of the department of public welfare the Inquisitor General of the State of Connecticut. If Jesus and I lis apostles were in the flesh and were to have a common purse, as they had in Palestine, and were to accept contributions as they did in Palestine, the Inquisitor General of Connecticut would want to know about His work, and pass on it, and the state police (largely members of the Knights of Columbus and affiliated orders) would interest themselves hugely in His work; and when they heard Him say, “Call no man father upon the earth,” and they were egged on by “father” Flaherty and “father” O'Toole, they would no doubt try to lock Him up and hold Him for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And if Paul, one of the apostles of Jesus Christ, came around and word got out that he was accepting contributions for the relief of the poor saints at Jerusalem he would get the. same treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But that wouldn’t be all, at least not if we may judge of what happened to two of Jehovah’s witnesses, George F. W. Thomson and his wife, Olga Thomson, at Rockville, Conn. Originally arrested last January on the foolish charge that preaching the gospel is violating a hawkers’ ordinance, they were pounced upon by a squad of state police and detectives who grilled them from the afternoon of one day till one o’clock the next morning in the effort to force an admission from them that they had stolen a fur coat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effort did not succeed, but it shows what grand uses the modern Inquisition can make of members of the various police forces that are. at the same time members of or related to the Knights of Columbus. It all works together in line shape. But it has its drawbacks in a land only 15-percent Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Thomsons case came up on appeal in the Superior Court the original complaint was amended, so that it was charged that the defendants had not come before the Inquisitor General of the State of Connecticut (the secretary of the department of public welfare above referred to), and an opportunity was provided by that gentleman to allow him to gently horn in on the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He was even willing, so he said, to come to Brooklyn on Sunday, if necessary, so that he could determine for himself whether the work Jehovah God is doing now in the earth is fit to be “approved” by the Inquisitor General of the State of Connecticut. The “offer” was, of course, ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because we know it will be enjoyed by our readers, we present herewith the Defendants’ Memorandum, read in open court by Clarence Scott, of counsel for the defense.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"># # # # «</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">To the Court</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This case originated in the police court of the city of Rockville, was brought to this court on appeal by the defendants and was heard on April 14 1932 and was thence continued to this date [April 19 1932] for final decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The defendants and each of them contended that on the twenty-first day of January 1932 and at the time of said hearing they, as Jehovah’s witnesses, were fully commissioned servants of the God of heaven and earth; that they were also duly appointed and authorized representatives and members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, an organization duly incorporated in 1884 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“the dissemination of Bible Truths in va-“rious languages by means of the publica-“tion of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other “religious documents, and by the use of all “other lawful means ... for the further-“ance of the purpose stated;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That at the time the acts complained of were alleged to have been done, these defendants and each of them were, as such ministers and representatives, in truth and in fact performing entirely and only their bounden and lawfully assigned duty to preach the good news of the Kingdom of Jehovah by oral communication and by dissemination of printed messages from house to house among the people, in obedience and submission to the mandate of the Eternal Creator; and that said printed messages consist of books and booklets wholly dedicated to Jehovah God and which are expositions of the Holy Scriptures,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(a) explaining the fulfilment of the prophecies recorded by Jehovah’s witnesses of the past, (b) announcing the establishment on earth at this time of the eternal Kingdom of Jehovah, the hope of all peoples, through and by His Son Christ Jesus, the King of kings,</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(c) showing forth the Divine purpose in the very near future utterly to overthrow and destroy the entire organization, both visible and invisible, of Satan the god of this world, and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(d) clearly pointing out the privilege and responsibility now resting with each individual who acquires or has opportunity to acquire knowledge of the purposes and present requirements of the Most High God;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">That the defendants gave to any and all persons interested in learning about the Kingdom of Jehov-vah opportunity to share in this work of disseminating Bible truths in the manner stated;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That these defendants and each of them, having voluntarily entered into a covenant with and by invitation of Jehovah through Christ Jesus, and also with their associate members of the Watch Tower Bible and Traet Society, to perform said work of disseminating Bible truths, did and do such work without pecuniary profit and with neither desire for nor expectation of pecuniary gain, strictly and only because it is their conscientious understanding and belief of the Divine requirement, and their privilege and duty so to do in obedience to the commandment of the Almighty God as clearly set forth in Holy Writ for the guidance of Jehovah's witnesses;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That evidence was submitted by the defendants in support of these contentions, which evidence has not been controverted by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The defendants furthermore reminded the court of the privileges, immunities and guarantees of the supreme law of Connecticut, which to all persons assures freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience and without discrimination as to mode of worship, consistent with peace and safety and the public welfare; and that the constitution of this state also declares that no law shall be passed to curtail or restrain the liberties retained by and inherent in the people, or to create </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> discrimination as to the right of persons freely to choose and practice a mode of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, therefore, these defendants and each of them earnestly and most emphatically protest against the attempted degradation of their work to the level of hawker or peddler, as charged by the state; and they do likewise protest against any attempt on the part of the state to subject their cause and work to the inquisitorial investigations and determinations of any officer or agent of the department of public welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In obedience to the command of Jehovah, and with all due respect, the defendants do now submit to the court, and invite thoughtful consideration of, the happenings involving Jehovah’s witnesses, namely, Peter and his fellow apostles of Jesus Christ, who anciently were brought before the supreme council-court of Jewry, as portrayed in the Record at Acts, chapter five, verses thirty-three to thirty-seven inclusive; and particularly the speech finally addressed to that august tribunal by one Gamaliel, learned counsellor of the time, namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ Refrain from these men, and let them alone: “for if this counsel or this work be of men, “it will come to nought: but if it be of God, “ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be “found even to fight against God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise attention is invited to the record (Daniel, chapter three) concerning three of Jehovah’s witnesses whom Nebuehednezzar, an ancient king of Babylon, did in rage and fury command to be brought before him for their refusal to fall down and worship the golden image which he had set up, they choosing rather to worship and serve only Jehovah, the living God, and to trust in Him to deliver them from a burning fiery furnace into which they were threatened by the king to be thrust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These defendants and each of them, soberly and without malice, do now hereby on their own behalf address to this court words originally spoken by their accused brethren, Peter and John (fellow witnesses and valiant soldiers of Christ Jesus), to tho high council-court in the city of Jerusalem, namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Whether it be right in the sight of God “to hearken unto you more than unto God, “judge ye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Acts, chapter four, verse nineteen.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And lastly, the counsel of the Eternal God, Jehovah himself, in words recorded in the second Psalm, verses ten to twelve, is by these defendants hereby respectfully noticed before this court, namely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Be wise now therefore, 0 ye kings: be in-“strueted, ye judges of the earth. Serve Je-“hovah with fear, and rejoice with trem-“bling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye “perish from the way, when his wrath is “kindled but a little. Blessed are all they “that put their trust in him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The defendants, therefore, in cheerful and voluntary obedience to the terms of their covenant with Jehovah, as His witnesses, and in joyful performance of His mandates, must and, by His grace, will continue to proclaim His name and the good news of His everlasting Kingdom, the hope of all the distressed peoples of earth, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font5"> they will do in such manner as they conscientiously deem to be best suited to the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Responsibility for continuing or removing the restraint now unreasonably and unlawfully imposed and sought to be further imposed by the state upon these defendants rests now, therefore, with this court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respectfully submitted, </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Clarence Scott </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Of counsel for the defendants</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is a hard thing to jump thirteen ways at once, and it is “unlucky”, or supposed to be, and maybe it is a little unlucky for the judge of the Superior Court at Rockville that he did not make it a little clearer just what he had in mind when he shot off the thirteen-barreled decision which we reproduce below. We have numbered the mental positions, so that our readers can trace them and see if they can make head or tail of them, except that the defendants were “judicially<sup>-</sup>’ set at liberty to continue their work of serving Jehovah God according to the dictates of their own consciences, and the instructions which they receive from the headquarters of His work in the earth:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. [Bi/ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the Court:]</span><span class="font5"> Now they were either selling these books from door to door or else they were out seeking contributions. There is no way to get out of that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. I stated last week there was some question about the applicability of the [local] ordinance as to what they were doing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. There is no question in my mind as to what did happen on certain occasions. I think the fair import of what they did was the sale of these pamphlets, these booklets, at least on two or three occasions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. There is no question in my mind that on their own evidence they were seeking contributions, and to do so under the statute they ought to have the approval of the state board of public welfare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. I find them guilty of violation of the state statute.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">6. I have not passed judgment on the violation of the ordinance.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">7. What I have decided to do, however, is to give them the benefit of any question;</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font5">10. They understand, of course, that if they continue to do these things without complying with the ordinary reasonable laws of the state and ordinances of the city they are responsible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">11. That is the disposition of these eases that the Court will make at the present time.</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Yuma Cops and Police Judge Grab Bear by Tail; Wondering How to Let Go</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">(Reprinted from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma County</span><span class="font4"> [Ariz.] </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Farmer)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Y</span><span class="font6">UMA police, the sheriff's office and Police</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge R. I. Winn grabbed a bear by the tail last Sunday, according to reports reaching the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma County Vanner,</span><span class="font6"> and are in a predicament as a result. Ergo:—they have hold of the tail and can’t let go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It's a sad, sad story, mates; especially over at the city hall, where in this matter “His Honor<sup>-</sup>’ occupies a position very much akin to that of Boob McNutt in Rube Goldberg’s cartoons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It all came about when &quot;the powers that be’ rather high-handedly planned to arrest a chap named Dwight Kenyon and his wife last Sunday. With characteristic stupidity they arrested the wrong woman in the person of Mrs. Mark Harris, wife of a Yuma cotton buyer. Shortly afterwards, when Mr. Kenyon visited the jail to find out why Mrs. Harris had been taken into custody he also was placed under arrest. As a result, it is understood, those responsible for the arrests will probably have a damage suit apiece on their hands presently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meanwhile they (‘the powers that be’) have been “seeing” the newspapers in an attempt to “keep the story out of the papers’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems that last Sunday Mr. Kenyon and his wife were doing religious work in Yuma for the International Bible Students Association, of New York, which claims a considerable membership in Yuma. It seems also that the Kenyons were suspected of selling books on Sunday. Local members of the organization say, however, that they do not sell books, but give them away to folks who contribute to the Bible school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyway, Mrs. Harris, mistaken for Mrs. Kenyon, was arrested on Fourth Ave. and unceremoniously hustled off to jail. There, she avers, she was treated with utter lack of consideration. When she wanted to call her husband, it is said, she was curtly told, “We don’t care anything about your husband.” When she protested she was not Mrs. Kenyon, but Mrs. Harris, she was invited to “tell it to the Marines”. Presently Deputy Sheriff Baker came in. Being acquainted with Mrs. Harris he greeted her with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Good,</span><span class="font6"> morning, Mrs. Harris'’. Whereupon the other minions of the law awoke with a start and decided they had arrested the wrong victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meanwhile 3Mr. Kenyon had been told his wife was in jail. He hurried to the Bastile. Upon arrival there somebody said, ‘‘This is the one we want to lock up,” and he was duly seized. However, Mr. Kenyon had not been caught in the act of violating any law, and no warrant for his arrest had been issued. In fact, they had nothing “on him”, so that after they had arrested him they began to wonder WHY they had pinched him. And, seemingly, they are still wondering WHY. There is, of course, no law against “wondering’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make a long story short, they finally released Kenyon on his own recognizance with instructions to appear before the Sultan of Yuma, His Imperial Highness Judge Winn, at 9 a.m. Monday morning. Whether Kenyon was warned “not to ask for a receipt” in case the Sultan fined him, is not known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyway, when Mr. Kenyon appeared before His Majesty Monday morning, the Sultan graciously told him that “they” would not press charges against him. At the same time it was delicately suggested to Mr. Kenyon that he should leave town in consideration of the “favor” being done him. Evidently the powers, upon giving the matter a think, had concluded that they had grabbed a bear’s tail. A moment later they found that they couldn’t let go, when Mr. Kenyon said he would not leave town and neither would he consent to drop the matter. He had been arrested and he INSISTED upon being PROSECUTED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the case was continued until April 28. Meanwhile Mrs. Kenyon collapsed when she heard her husband had been arrested. She required the services of two doctors. Also J. Fred Hoover, attorney, has been retained to look after the interests of those involved in this highhanded proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last development in the case was when a representative of the “powers” called upon a local daily paper Tuesday and asked that the story be “kept out of the papers”.</span></p>

Knapp, editor of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yuma County Farmer, </span><span class="font4">Yuma, Arizona, writes us that since the foregoing was published, and probably as a consequence of publishing it, his newspaper plant was burned to the ground; that the fire was clearly incendiary, and two children narrowly escaped cremation.

<p><span class="font5">Di:\K Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am in receipt of your letter of the 8th inst., advising us that you intend to reprint the story I sent you some weeks ago, as to the treatment given in Yuma, to Mr. Kenyon, one of the Golden Age organization workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may interest you to know that the publication by the I’uwui </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">County Farmer</span><span class="font5"> of the story concerning Mr. Kenyon, together with other stories of graft and corruption, resulted last Saturday morning in the complete destruction of our plant by fire. The fire was clearly incendiary, and two children narrowly escaped cremation in the flames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had the second largest circulation in Yuma county. Ours is the people’s paper. We are fighting the power trust and graft and corruption generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A citizens’ committee is trying to raise funds to buy new equipment. Meanwhile, the paper will continue to be published, even tho we have to get it out as a mimeographed handbill, on a mimeograph loaned by a friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The financial condition of our people is such that it is very, very doubtful that enough money can be raised locally. Many poor people are giving from 25 cents to a dollar, and a few give more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps some of your readers would like to help. Ours is the only paper in western Arizona that is open to you and your membership. It is open to all, at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If any of your readers care to help reestablish this paper, and if you are willing to assist, we would suggest you let them send donations to you, to be turned over to us when we have enough money in sight to warrant going ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In my opinion, the recent story about the treatment given Mrs. Harris, who was mistaken for Mrs. Kenyon, wife of one of your workers, was a prime incitant tc the incendiary crime that destroyed our plant last Saturday morning at 4 o’clock. Our loss was about $4,000. We had no insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are fighting one of the rottenest political gangs in the west, and we have been slowly but SURELY killing them off with such satire as the story of which I sent you a copy.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Aluminum Ware Takes a Life at Cumberland College</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6"> LADY sends us two newspaper clippings regarding a death at Cumberland College, Williamsburg, Ky. The first one, dated February 15, after admitting that Miss Eva Wynn, 16 years of age, had passed away, said that “Dr. A. T. McCormack, secretary, and other officers of the state board of health started an investigation into the illness of thirty-one others at the college” and that the hoard had ordered a special serum from Chicago to still further poison the blood of the unfortunates who had been made ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second clipping, dated a day later, stated that Dr. McCormack had said that cerebrospinal meningitis was the cause of the death of Miss Wynn, and then he is alleged to have made the incredible statement that “although Miss Wynn also suffered a slight attack of food poisoning that ailment was not a contributory cause of death”, which statement, of course, is about what you would expect to emanate from a political doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Along with the clippings, the lady sent us the following letter, which we are sure our subscribers will be glad to see, for, despite all efforts of the Kentucky health board and medical “experts” everywhere to the contrary, there will be no more deaths from aluminum poisoning at Cumberland College:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am enclosing some information regarding food poisoning at Cumberland College, Williamsburg, Ky. A lady who brings me farm produce has a daughter attending this college, and she told me of how very ill her daughter had been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I suggested to her that probably the poisoning was due to aluminum cooking utensils, and she said that the authorities had traced it to food that had been left in the frigidairc and that they had had the same trouble once before. But at my suggestion she wrote her daughter about it and received a reply that she need not worry any further about her as they had ordered all aluminum ware removed, and white enameled ware had taken its place, and also that a similar change was to be made in other institutions. She also said that the young lady’s death was really caused by the poison, as a blood vessel in the lungs bursted by vomiting and she smothered to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You will notice, however, from the enclosed newspaper clippings that the secretary of the state board of health pronounced the death cause to be meningitis. I failed to keep the main newspaper article, but probably you have it. I thought this might verify some of the facts, and you can use it as you care in further light upon the subject.</span></p>

Then I was under the impression the bonds had 1o have the approval of the United States Department of State. I never could imagine the Equitable Trust Company, Dillon, Read &amp;&nbsp;Company, Blair &amp;&nbsp;Company, of Wall Street and Broad Street, would put bonds on the market for the American public to buy unless they were a sound investment. Now I know to my sorrow how I have been duped by the big banks and the Secretary of State Department, United States. The bonds I hold have defaulted, and I am broke. My wife don’t own enough to bury me. And I after being so saving. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">enclose the invoices and you can sec what I paid for the bonds, some above par. One thousand dollars in Bogota bonds belong to my son, whom I advised to invest all he had. There have been lots of crooked deals put over the American investors, and I suppose all crooks will go free. The different houses that issued the bonds have transferred their agency to other banks, some once and some twice. I am completely at a loss to know how and where I can get some reliable information as to the policy of Colombia, Antioquia Department, CHy of Bogota, Government of Bolivia and Hungarian bonds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Xavier, dead 400 years, was exposed for adoration at Old Goa, India. It is claimed that 30,000 people filed past the open coffin and kissed the feet of the corpse. A picture of the cadaver belies the statement that it is in perfect preservation. A cautious statement is made that “the consensus of opinion is that the body will be in quite a fit state ten years hence”. One reason why they might wish to have another exhibition ten years hence is conveyed in the following paragraph from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of India, of December 7, 1931:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not possible to say what amount in cash the pilgrims contribute directly to the church through this channel, but it runs into lakhs of rupees, while to the Portuguese colony of Goa the income also runs into several lakhs. The pilgrim is taxed at every turn— small sums, certainly, but amounting in the aggregate to an appreciable item in the expense of the pilgrimage. He pays a transport tax, entering and leaving the country, varying from two annas up to twelve. Every package of luggage means two annas. Every time he goes by bus or car to or from Old Goa he pays two annas more. There is a special license to bo paid by the bus or car owner for the privilege of running to Old Goa. This is, of course, passed on to the passenger. Hotel charges are advanced fifty percent, while the pilgrim who decides to camp at Old Goa and purchase his food has to pay extra for it to meet the heavy charges made to the stall-holders for the plots they occupy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not wish to do anything to break in on the happiness of those who find pleasure in kissing old people's feet, and more particularly those who have had no chance to wash them for four hundred years, in a hot climate like India, and especially where they have had a good thing out of it in church contributions, transport taxes, luggage taxes, hotel rake-offs, food gouges and stall concessions extracted from others, but we just point out, as a matter of duty, that on the day the feet-kissing began, “his excellency,” the visiting “apostolic delegate”, blessed the new pier at Goa with the same kind of blessing that was bestowed upon Cervera’s fleet and Nobile’s airship, and we think that means that Old Goa has had its last feet-kissing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">S MANY of the readers of THE GOLDEN AGE know, -f*- Judge Rutherford's sole interest in the work in which he is engaged is to spread the knowledge of the kingdom of God shortly to be established upon the earth. His books have reached a circulation of over 120,000,000 copies in the past twelve years and are the most widely read of all books, the Bible only excepted. Neither are the publishers of these books, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, interested in any pecuniary gain from the distribution of these books. They are placed in the hands of the people at the cost of production and distribution. This organization is interested solely in dispensing the Bible truth to the people, telling them concerning the end of the wicked, oppressive organizations of the earth, as prophesied in the Bible, and showing further that prophecies which are now being fulfilled are clear evidence that the present “disorder” of things will make way for God’s kingdom, his government of righteousness, which is the desire of all the order-loving people of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford sets forth these facts so clearly in his ten books that we feel everyone should read them all. In view of the statement made above, that neither Judge Rutherford nor the publishers receive any pecuniary gain from the distribution of these books, it can truthfully be said that these ten books can be had for the usual price of one, namely $2.50. Mailed anywhere, postpaid, upon receipt of money order for that amount, or, if you wish, they will be sent C.O.D. Use the Coupon.</span></p>
