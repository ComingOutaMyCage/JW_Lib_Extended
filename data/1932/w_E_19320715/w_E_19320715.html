<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>JEHOVAH’S EXECUTIONER</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.”—John 5:22,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH’S law of retribution is just and right. Like violence must be requited with like violence. ‘An eye for an eye; a life for a life.’ (Ex. 21: 24;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Deut. 19:21) It was the duty of Lucifer to worship Jehovah; but instead he set up a worship for himself, and this led him to commit murder. Satan and his organization for centuries has continued to reproach Jehovah’s name and to shed innocent blood. It was the duty of Ahab to worship God; but he adopted and practiced the Devil religion, which led him to commit murder. God has declared that Satan and his organization shall be destroyed and all of his possessions transferred to Christ Jesus. God’s decree that Ahab and Jezebel and all their house should be destroyed and that the kingdom should be transferred to Jehu foreshadows transferring the possession of the earth to Christ. When Elijah was at Mount Horeb God had instructed him to anoint Jehu to the kingdom. The slaying of Ahab and Jezebel would meet the requirements of God’s law for the murder of Naboth; therefore it was doubtless because of the introduction of Baal worship into Israel that God decreed that the kingdom should be taken away from Ahab and given to Jehu. Elijah, without doubt under the direction of the Lord, withheld from Ahab the information that the kingdom should be transferred to Jehu, who then and there was present; because, had Ahab been given that knowledge, he and Jezebel would have tried to kill Jehu and probably would have done so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> More than fourteen years elapsed from the time Elijah was directed to anoint Jehu until the anointing was actually performed. Immediately thereafter Jehu went forth and drove furiously or with madness in the execution of Jehovah’s purpose against the enemy. This pictured how Jesus must wait until God’s due time for him to begin action against the enemy and how as soon as he received the order from Jehovah Jesus did proceed to the execution of that order by ousting Satan from heaven and is proceeding now to the further execution of his orders.—Ps. 110:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’Doubtless Elijah and Elisha often wondered as to when Jehovah would issue orders to proceed with the anointing of Jehu and to the execution of the work he was to do. Those of the church pictured by Elijah and Elisha have often wondered what is the meaning of the Jehu work, and when it will begin, and whether or not they will have any part in it. It is consoling to God’s people to know that Jehovah in his own good time directs his anointed people to proceed with his work. His work is done according to his will, not according to the will of man. In harmony with this it is written: “And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.”—Rev. 10:4; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font4">Book One, pages 177,178.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHU ANOINTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> In due time the day arrived for the anointing of Jehu and the Lord directed Elisha to act. Therefore Elisha sent a young man, one of the children of the prophets, to perform the work of anointing Jehu. This occurred at a time when Jehu was warring at Ramoth-gilead. This name, Ramoth-gilead, means “heights of the heap of the witness (or testimony)”. (2 Ki. 9:1-10) This would seem to suggest that the anointing of Jehu and the beginning of his work would be at a time when God’s people were bearing testimony against Satan’s organization. The anointing of Jehu was done secretly and was unobserved even by- the members of his military staff, and it was done in haste. It was Elisha who sent this young man to do the anointing. So far as the Jehu picture relates to the faithful witnesses of Jehovah on earth this shows that the anointing comes upon the Jehu class during the period of the Elisha work of the church after 1919. The facts indicate that it points to the date of September 1922, which marks the beginning of the pouring out of the seven plagues upon “Christendom”, upon both the church and the state, that is to say, upon the Devil’s organization. As Jehu’s military staff did not know what was taking place, and had to inquire, so likewise the remnant of the Jehu company on earth were having a part in the fulfilment of the prophecy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">by the grace of the Lord, but they were unaware that the anointing had been poured out upon the Jehu class and that the Jehu work was being done and they were participating in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The anointing of Jehu was really done by Jehovah, and Elisha and the young man whom he sent were merely outward symbols of this work. (1 Ki. 19:16; 2 Ki. 9:3-6) The young man here mentioned seems to correspond very well with what Queen Esther pictured, to wit, the bringing of others into the service of Jehovah with Mordecai after Mordecai had been for some time in God’s service. Also, the one performing this work being designated “young man” suggests that it was a time when, according to the prophecy, ‘young men see visions.’ (Joel 2: 28, 29) All this points to the fact that the anointing and the beginning of the Jehu work would take place during the Elisha period or work of the church and during which time God raised up his “young man” for the occasion. It further shows that God would reveal the fact of the anointing and the commission involved therein by means of unfolding and revealing the meaning of his prophecies to those devoted to him. It is well known by God’s people that he has opened up his prophecies to his people within the last few years. Also it suggests that Jehovah is using members of the Elisha class to call this matter to the attention of one another who form the class pictured by Jehu. Christ Jesus is the Head of the Jehu company. We must not, therefore, make the mistake of concluding that the young man doing the anointing would represent the remnant informing Jesus that the time had come to begin the Jehu work. On the contrary, this merely shows that the anointing was made in harmony with God’s will, and the statement of the young man to Jehu was an announcement made calling attention to what was to be done, similar to that made by the angel, as represented in Revelation 14:18. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 340.) It is Jesus who is the Head of the Elisha company, and he gives information to the remnant concerning Jehu, his commission, and the work that is to be done. We must bear in mind that both Elisha and the young man were merely instruments in the hands of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COMMISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> A commission is a formal warrant of authority defining what shall be done by the one to whom it is directed, and grants certain powers and authority to perform the duties therein specified. It is hardly reasonable that Jehovah would anoint and commission one to do something with which the creature was not in sympathy and in harmony. The facts show that during the fourteen or more years following the death of Naboth Jehu had kept in mind the denunciation of Jehovah’s Prophet Elijah against Ahab and Jezebel. When Ahab fought with the Syrians and was killed Jehu had witnessed a partial fulfilment of Jehovah ’s decree against Ahab’s house, as the record shows, but that was not the end of it, by any means. (1 Ki. 22: 37, 38) Jehu must have been against Baal worship; otherwise God would not have anointed and commissioned him to do the work he did. Jehu must have concluded that when God’s due time came he would take his place on the side of Jehovah and do what Jehovah commanded him. Jehovah had said to Elijah that he yet had seven thousand in Israel that had not bowed the knee to Baal, and the course taken by Jehu strongly supports the conclusion that Jehu was one of these seven thousand. This would further support the conclusion that the fulfilment of the Jehu picture includes the remnant, Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth, and who are pictured in the seven thousand. —See Revelation 11:13; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 214.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> The commission or warrant of authority which Jehovah gave to Jehu reads: “And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel. For the whole house of Ahab shall perish; and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel. And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah; and the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her.”—2 Ki. 9:7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehu’s military associates were eager to know the mission of the “young man” who had come and left so hurriedly, and they put the question to Jehu. Upon learning from him that Jehu had been anointed as the ruler in Israel these men hastened to make known the anointing of the king. The words of the prophet, which doubtless Jehu had just repeated to them, were sufficient authority for them to hail him as the king. The facts show that at the Cedar Point convention in 1922, when the eyes of the understanding of God's people were opened to the great truths that Jehovah God had commissioned Christ Jesus to destroy Satan's power and organization in the universe; that Christ Jesus was at the temple of Jehovah for judgment; that judgment had begun and that now there was a great witness work to be done on the earth by the anointed people of God, and that under the direction of the King at the temple, God’s people then and there raised the slogan: “Advertise the King and the kingdom.” Jehu’s military assistants blew long blasts upon their trumpets and shouted: “Jehu is king.” Likewise God’s anointed people in convention, on learning that the King was at the temple, shouted for joy and began immediately to take action accordingly. An organized movement for the giving of the testimony was begun, and those who understood and appreciated what must be done manifested their willingness and eagerness to do their part in this day of the Lord’s power. (Ps. 110: 3) ‘All power in heaven and in earth is given to Christ Jesus,’ and which is his commission, and ineludes full authority and power to destroy the Devil and his organization.—Matt. 28:18; Heb. 2:14;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2 Thess. 2: 8; 1 John 3:8; Rev. 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEGINS WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• Immediately following his anointing and the receipt of his commission Jehu took steps to execute and he did execute the same. He “conspired” with, or, literally, brought to him, others and united them with him in his movement against Joram (or Je-horam). Likewise, immediately upon learning not only of the commission to Christ Jesus but that the time had come for judgment, and that a testimony work must be given in connection therewith, God’s people banded themselves together in an organized movement to do this work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Jehu had his plans laid and he did not want any worshiper of Baal or traitor to interfere with the carrying out of his commission. He determined, therefore, to move secretly and to surprise the enemy. This shows that it is in harmony with God’s will for his people to go about their business without calling attention to themselves. Jehu directed that no one should go forth or be permitted to escape out of the city and go and tell Joram and Jezebel concerning his movement. Jehoram (or Joram) had been in a fight with the Syrians under Hazael, who was also doing some executing work against the wicked Israelites, and Jehoram had got bruised up and had gone down to Jezreel for repairs. He was keeping close to the vineyard that his father had stolen from Naboth by killing him. It is quite likely that that was an elegant place for taking sun baths and Jehoram was indulging in that luxury that he might recuperate from his wounds. This Joram (or Jehoram) was a bad man and he is the same one of whom Elisha said: “This son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head.” (2 Ki. 6:32) During the World War the rulers of “Christendom” got pretty well bruised up, and since then they have been keeping close to their League of Nations, basking in its sunlight and trying to recuperate, even as Joram was doing. But they will not recover.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Ahaziah was then king of Judah at Jerusalem. He was a grandson of Ahab, because Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, had married Jehoram of Jerusalem, the father of Ahaziah. Ahab had a son named Jehoram (or Joram) also, and he succeeded Ahab as king of Samaria. In addition Ahab had seventy sons still living in Samaria. (2 Ki. 10:1) Of course by that time Jezebel was an old granny, but as mean as ever. Ahaziah, king of Judah, had certain princes and sons of his brethren that ministered to him. God’s decree was that all of the house of Ahab, which pictured Satan’s organization, must be cut off. Jehu started out to clean out the whole crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Just at the time Jehu started on his work of executing his commission these two kings of the house of Israel and Judah, that is to say, the king of Judah at Jerusalem, who was Ahaziah, and the king of the ten tribes at Samaria who was Jehoram (or Joram), were together down at Jezreel. Ahaziah had gone down there to visit his uncle because he was sick, and doubtless to console him while he was being patched up. (2 Chron. 22:6) These two kings then and there present constituted the ruling factors of the entire twelve tribes of Israel, and both were unfaithful to the Lord and would walk in the way of their ancestor Ahab. Of Ahaziah, king of Judah, it is written: “Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Athaliah the daughter [granddaughter] of Omri. He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.”—2 Chron. 22:2-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> These two rulers had been influenced by the wicked women Athaliah and Jezebel and had turned the house of the Lord at Jerusalem into a place of worship of Baal. “For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Baalim.” (2 Chron. 24:7; 2 Ki. 8:26) Without doubt God had so ordained the matter that these two&quot; kings would be down at Jezreel together so that Jehu could catch them there and speedily execute his commission against them. This is proof that the Jehu company of which Christ Jesus is the Head will make a clean sweep of the ruling powers of “Christendom” and their allies who are together in a conspiracy against God’s people. And here it is interesting to note how Jehu carried out his commission.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Jehu got into his chariot and, together with his faithful helpers, began his work of execution. “So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.” (2 Ki. 9:16) Evidently Joram was uneasy, because he kept a watchman in the tower to see what might come to pass; but his watchman did not obtain much information for his master except to say that it was Jehu driving. “And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?” (2 Ki. 9:17) This very well corresponds to what the visible ruling powers of “Christendom” are now doing in keeping watch in respect to Jehovah’s witnesses. Doubtless the chief one of the Devil’s crowd having to do with the things of the earth, and under the command of the Devil himself, is having a hand in the matter of watching and arranging the movements of his earthly company.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">A man on horseback is a symbol of military equipment and movement. The king then directed that a man should be sent on horseback to find out the meaning of the advancing of the chariot of Jehu. When this messenger hastened to Jehu and accosted him Jehu made him get to the rear and would not let him return. A second messenger was sent out by Joram to inquire if Jehu was coming in peace or for trouble. And Jehu told him to get out of the way and get to the rear, and he did so. (2 Ki. 9:18,19) The two kings were getting anxious. “And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously [in madness, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin].”</span><span class="font4"> (2 Ki. 9:20) Jehu was now recognized by the rulers, but they were ignorant of the fact that God had anointed Jehu and that their day was at hand. Being guilty of crimes made them uneasy. Their own wickedness made these kings cowards. “The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.”—Prov. 28:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> These two kings, doubtless trembling and uneasy, went out to meet the mad driver Jehu, and the Lord saw to it that they met right at Naboth’s vineyard. “And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel, and Ahaz.iah king of Judah, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.” (2 Ki. 9: 21) When these offspring of the murderers of Naboth approached, doubtless Jehu then had in mind the words of Elijah uttered in denunciation of Ahab. King Joram was anxious to find out Jehu’s mission. “And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her witchcrafts, are so many?” (2 Ki. 9:22) Immediately when these guilty kings saw that Jehu was after them they cried “Treachery!” and fled: “And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah!” (2 Ki. 9:23) This proves that the Devil religion was the chief reason for Jehu’s slaying work, that it brought reproach upon the name of Jehovah; and that the hypocritical practice in “Christendom” has been the chief reason for the reproach upon Jehovah’s name and that such has made possible the wicked political and commercial powers that have ruled and do now rule the world. Jehu called the practice of these kings and that of old Jezebel “whoredoms” and “witchcrafts”; and likewise the Devil’s organization, particularly “Christendom”, is now guilty before God. As these kings fled Jehu picked off Joram first. “And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms; and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.” (2 Ki. 9:24) Mark how well this corresponds with the prophecy concerning the arrows of Jesus that shall pierce the hearts of the enemy. “Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.” (Ps. 45:5) Jehu had a bow, and used it. Likewise the Greater-than-Jehu, Christ Jesus, will use a weapon of destruction: “And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.” (Rev. 6:2) As Jehu was supported by his military staff, so the Lord takes others into the fight with him: “And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”—Rev. 19:14-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> And now here is the proof that Jehu stood near by and heard Elijah denounce Ahab for stealing the vineyard and murdering Naboth: “Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord laid this burden upon him; Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the Lord; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the Lord. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the Lord.” (2 Ki. 9: 25, 26) This also proves that the Lord had selected Jehu at the time he was a commander in Ahab’s army to do the very work that he did on this occasion and that it foreshadows the execution by the Lord Jesus of Satan’s representatives on earth. God had decreed that the dogs and the birds should eat the flesh of the house of Ahab, and doubtless this is what happened to the body of Joram. (1 Ki. 21:19-24) That was a partial fulfilment of the prophecy in vindication of Jehovah’s name, and pictured the beginning of a slaughter work that must be done by the Lord’s army, which Ezekiel pictured under the symbol of ‘six men with slaughter weapons by their sides’. (Ezek. 9:1-6) Jehu was executing Jehovah’s decree; and the Greater-than-Jehu, Christ Jesus, will execute Jehovah’s decree at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Jehu then proceeded to the execution of another one of Ahab’s descendants, ‘the seed of the Serpent.’ Ahaziah had fled and hid himself at Samaria, but he was brought out and killed. “But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house; and Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. ’ ’—2 Ki. 9: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> That this execution was done in righteousness and at Jehovah’s command is made certain by the divine record, which states: “And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram; for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.” (2 Chron. 22:7) This alliance and cooperation of the two kings in their wicked work, and their being killed in close proximity, indicates that the antitypical fulfilment of the prophecy will be upon the combined forces of Satan’s organization, particularly in the land of “Christendom”, and that the execution will take place at the hand of Christ and his army, and that all of the ruling powers shall fall before his victorious march.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EXECUTION CONTINUES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Jehu was not done with the work he was commissioned to do. He had slain two kings, but Ahab had more sons; in fact he had seventy sons by his numerous wives and concubines, all of which were Devil worshipers. By this time it was announced throughout the realm, we may be sure, that Jehu was king and was proceeding to execute the house of Ahab. He would serve notice upon the rulers and these sons to give them a chance to fight. Therefore he sent them word to get ready for what was coming. “And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s children, saying, Now, as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.” —2 Ki. 10:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Jehu would not shirk his duty by avoiding a fight. He was certain that his commission was from Jehovah and that Jehovah would be with his anointed when in the fight and would give him the victory over anyone that disputed his claim to the throne of Israel. He therefore would give his opponents chance to get the best of their men and get ready for the fight that was certain to follow and which he intended to push. Likewise Christ Jesus, the chief one whom Jehu foreshadowed, fought with Satan the Devil and his officers and cast them out of heaven. Also, the course that Jehu took foreshadows that Christ Jesus now permits Satan to assemble his forces and to get ready for the decisive battle at Armageddon which is certain to follow. As Jehu sent letters to the enemy, even so now Jehovah by his anointed King, Christ Jesus, causes the remnant, to whom is committed the obligation of giving the testimony, to serve notice upon Satan’s armies. In harmony with this it is written by the prophet: ‘ ‘ Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong. Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen [nations], and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, 0 Lord.’’-Joel 3: 9-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Christ Jesus has not yet compelled the ruling factors of the world to submit to him. He lets the nations combine in leagues, and then permits them to choose any or all of their best men of the nations to engage in the fight. All of these are sons of the Devil, whom Ahab pictured, and the Lord serves notice on them that he will fight with their strongest, and with any or all of them that raise any question as to his right to the throne of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Jehu’s letters were really a challenge to all comers, and raised the question amongst the people: “ On whose side are you? Are you for the house of Ahab, or do you stand by Jehovah’s anointed king?” The Lord Jesus likewise is flinging a challenge to the enemy and raising the same question now before the nations and rulers of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses form a part of the anointed and elect “servant” of God and they have a part in this work by means of the radio message and millions of books, and house-to-house testimony work, in which the remnant is now engaging. The challenge of the Lord to Satan’s organization is flung out, and the question is raised before the rulers and before the people: “On whose side are you? Who is your God? Whom do you favor as having the right to rule the world?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> When the leaders and rulers mentioned in the foregoing text received Jehu’s letters they were exceedingly afraid, and claimed to be willing to do whatever Jehu said. Jesus declared that following the World War fear would take hold on men who ruled the world: “Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken. ’ ’ (Luke 21:26) This prophecy is now in course of fulfilment. The clergy of “Christendom” and their allies falsely claim to be on the Lord’s side, and so represent themselves before the people, even as the men of Israel claimed to be on the side of Jehu. Mere words counted for nothing with Jehu as long as these seventy sons of Ahab lived. The decrees of Jehovah had gone forth, and now they must be executed. Therefore Jehu wrote another letter to these same elders and rulers, asking them to prove which side they were on. ‘ ‘ Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. (Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.) And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel. And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.” (2 Ki. 10:6-8) We cannot properly construe this text to mean that the people living in “Christendom” are expected to kill the rulers. The matter of vital importance in this picture is the destruction of the house of Ahab, which included these seventy sons and which foreshadowed Satan’s organization which must be destroyed. Jehovah had laid upon Jehu the obligation to see that these seventy sons were slain, and whether Jehu did the slaying in person or caused it to be done was not the material point. It was the action of Jehu in determining that this should be done that led to the slaying of these seventy sons by others. He was prepared for battle, and if they had fought him Jehu would have been victorious and the seventy sons would have been slain together with many others. The real point of this part of the prophetic picture is that the modern brood of Ahab’s house that rules the world must be destroyed either directly or indirectly, and that by Jehovah’s Executioner, Christ Jesus. Whether this be done by Christ Jesus or some members of his army, or even by some of Satan’s own organization, is not of great importance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Another matter of importance in this picture is this: There are in the world today many who have political, commercial and religious connections with Satan’s organization which rules and controls the world. These have the mark of the beast in their foreheads and in their hands. If they mean to take their stand on the Lord’s side they must completely sever their connection with the beastly rule and to them Satan’s organization must become as dead, and their allegiance to his organization must cease, and must be given to the Lord. This course they must take if they would receive the protection of the antitypieal Jehu, Christ Jesus, the great Executioner who will execute Jehovah’s judgments at Armageddon. The slaying of the seventy sons of Ahab well corresponds to the language of the psalmist: ‘ ‘ He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.” (Ps. 110:6) The heads over the divisions of Satan’s organization will be broken by the great Executioner, Christ Jesus. This will be a further vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Jehu declared to the people that Jehovah’s decree would be carried out to the uttermost: “And it eame to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these? Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.”—2 Ki. 10:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> Jehovah had caused his word to be spoken by his prophet Elijah concerning the house of Ahab, and Jehovah would prove that his prophet spoke the truth and this he would do in vindication of his word and his name. There is no record that these seventy sons were given a decent burial, and the presumption is that Jehovah’s decree concerning their flesh’s being consumed by the beasts and the birds was carried out. This exactly fits the declaration of the Lord’s prophet concerning the slaying of Satan’s organization and the disposition to be made of the carcasses. (Ezek. 39:17) Jehu fulfilled his commission by disposing of the entire house of Ahab. “So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.” (2 Ki. 10:11) The Scriptures make it clear that Jehovah God will cause his great Executioner, Christ Jesus, together with his army, to completely wipe out all the ruling powers of the world that have ruled by Satan’s direction and oppressed the human race and that have particularly persecuted his anointed people; not only those pictured by the rulers of Israel, but also those pictured by the rulers of Judah, which rulers also were agents of Satan the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Ahaziah of Judah had turned to Baal worship. He was a grandson of Ahab and Jezebel. Not only was Ahaziah killed, but those who supported him met a like fate. “And he [Jehu] arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way, Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king, and the children of the queen. And he said [to his men], Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.” (2 Ki. 10:12-14) The account of the same matter given in the Chronicles proves beyond a question of doubt that Jehu was there executing Jehovah’s decree and that therefore he foreshadowed Christ and his armies. (2 Chron. 22:8) It is probable that these forty-two corpses described in the above texts were devoured by the dogs and birds in harmony with Jehovah’s decree concerning Ahab’s house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Jehu, by slaying the princely adherents of Judah, might have provoked war with Judah. But evidently he did not consider that seriously or permit it to prevent him from proceeding with doing his duty. He knew only the terms of his commission from Jehovah, and that he was determined to carry out. He knew that God had decreed death to these wicked rulers and Devil worshipers and that the decree must be executed. He was blind to everything else. In this he corresponds with the work of Christ Jesus and of his faithful associates concerning whom it is written: “Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent ? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant? Seeing many things, but thou observes! not; opening the ears, but he hcareth not. The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify his law, and make it honourable.” (Isa. 42:19-21) Jehovah has assigned to his beloved Son the great work of executing the enemy that the name of Jehovah might be completely vindicated, and Christ is blind to everything that would in the least interfere with the complete performance of his commission. The same is true with those who are really devoted to the Lord God and who love and serve him and his kingdom. To boldly declare the truth now tends to bring down the wrath of all of Satan’s agents upon the heads of Jehovah’s witnesses. No personal fear or other selfish interests, however, will deter God’s faithful people from doing their duty as commanded. The testimony must be given by which the foreheads of those that sigh and cry for relief may be marked, and this must be done before the slaughter work begins. In doing this witness work the remnant are having some part in the execution of the judgments of the Lord written, and as soon as the witness work is completed the slaughter work must follow even as the Lord has said must be done by that part of Christ’s army pictured by the six men with slaughter weapons.—Ezek. 9: 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> The name “Ahab” means “brother (that is, friend) of (his) father”. Omri was Ahab’s father, and he is the one that seized the throne of Israel; and he was an exceedingly wicked creature. (1 Ki. 16: 25, 26) He was the servant and representative of the Devil. Ahab’s name therefore clearly points to the fact that the ruling powers of the nations of the world, particularly of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, are the friends of their father the Devil, whose will they do. They are the ‘seed of the Serpent’ which Jehovah by his Executioner will wipe out.—John 8: 44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Now Jehovah has brought his faithful remnant into the temple, given to them the garments of salvation, and brought them under the robe of righteousness, and has given them “a new name, which the mouth of the Lord [has named] ”. Those of the remnant must now be entirely devoted to Jehovah and must proclaim his praises while giving proclamation concerning the judgments of Jehovah written against his enemies. (Ps. 149:6) These faithful ones of the remnant have the Word of God in their hands, which is the sword, and they must wield that sword of truth with force and effect. In this the remnant have a part in the Jehu work by virtue of being in Christ and being a part of Jehovah’s “servant”. It is now the day of Jehovah’s vengeance, and he commands his faithful remnant to declare his truths to the nations of the world. “Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the Lord. ’ ’—Ps. 149: 6-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> In order to appreciate the agencies which the Lord uses to carry out his purposes we must keep in mind always that the question of paramount importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The remaining work of Jehu in executing the commission given to him by Jehovah shows that God’s Greatcr-than-Jehu, of which the remnant is a part, still has a work to do that Jehovah has assigned them to do. The remnant yet has something to do with this work.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>WHY GOVERNMENTS ARE UNRIGHTEOUS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">E</span><span class="font4">VILS prevail in every government of the world, including that of the United States, which is said to be the most nearly ideal of all governments of earth. It must be manifest to all reasonable minds that these evils do not proceed from the great Jehovah God. They are mentioned here for the purpose of showing that the nation or government of the United States is not a Christian nation and that Jehovah is not the god of that nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States government is conducted by imperfect men who are under the influence and control of the invisible ruler, Satan the Devil. This is absolutely true, whether they know it or not. “No man can serve two masters.” (Matt. 6:24) These men cannot serve a wicked government that oppresses and does injustice to the people and at the same time serve God. It is authoritatively written: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Rom. 6:16) God is not responsible for any unrighteous government. If Satan is the invisible ruler of the United States government, which is claimed to be the most nearly ideal, then what can be said about the other governments of earth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Jehovah God is supreme, could he not prevent Satan from exercising evil control over the governments of earth and make it possible for the people to have an upright government? He could do so, and that is exactly what he is now about to do. The purpose here is to lay the facts before the people that they may see what is now taking place and what will be the ultimate result for their good. Attention is called to the evils that rule the world in order to convince the people that Jehovah God is not the god of the nations of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let it be stated with the strongest emphasis that mention is here made of the cruelty and wickedness of the governments of earth, not for the purpose of causing rebellion against those governments, but for the sole purpose of advising the people that the invisible ruler of these nations and governments has been and is Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These things are mentioned for the further purpose of advising the people that their relief must come by turning themselves to Jehovah God and learning and obeying his laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without doubt there arc many men in these various governments of earth that have a sincere desire to see the conditions of the people bettered. They labor under the misapprehension, however, that man himself can bring about that betterment. They are wholly ignorant of the fact that the invisible ruler or god of the world is Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that Satan has influenced the minds of men and turned them away from truth and righteousness is ignored by the leaders of the nations. Millions of people on earth are even ignorant of the existence of the Devil and are ignorant of God’s purposes concerning the establishment of a righteous government on earth. That ignorance has been caused in large measure by the clergymen who have not taught the truth that Satan is the invisible ruler of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of these clergymen are willingly ignorant; but, whether willingly ignorant or not, they have not taught the people God’s Word concerning the common enemy of man. On the contrary, the clergy have taught the people that the leading nations of the earth are Christian and that these nations are properly called the representatives of God. They should have known better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The just, wise, loving and all-powerful Jehovah God would have a just and wise and beneficial government for the people. The fact that the governments are to the very contrary, that they are oppressive and that the people suffer thereunder shows that there is an evil influence exercised over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is written by one of God’s prophets: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” (Ps. 33:12) It is well known that the nations and peoples of the earth are not blessed now, and we know that the nations do not recognize Jehovah as the great God. In fact, few if any of the officials of the governments of earth even know to whom the name Jehovah refers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, after many centuries of laborious effort on the part of man to establish a satisfactory government, the people see that the governments of earth not only are unsatisfactory but are unrighteous. The people must now learn the truth of and concerning the influence that has caused the governments of this earth to be harsh and oppressive and unjust. The Lord’s time has come for them to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There will be some in positions of authority who upon hearing these statements will be inclined to make an effort to suppress that which is stated, that the people may not know it. That action of itself will prove the cruel influence being exercised by Satan. But the Lord will see to it that the people now have a chance to receive the truth; and blessed is the man or men who take it upon themselves to aid the people in understanding the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let those who oppose take fair warning that God will not permit the people longer to be kept in ignorance!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seeing that Jehovah God is supreme, can he exercise his supreme power to restrain Satan and set up a righteous government for the blessing of the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes! And that is what he will do. The people must now be able to see that man has not the ability nor the power to establish a righteous rule upon earth. They must see that some supernatural power must intervene in man’s behalf. God’s due time is at hand when this power shall intervene to establish righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Melchizedek was priest of the Most High God. (Gen. 14:18) “Most High ” means that God is above all. To Abraham God said: “I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. ’ ’ He did not compel Abraham to obey, but he advised Abraham of his supremacy and then invited Abraham to walk before the Lord in righteousness and receive his approval. This establishes the rule that God purposes that mankind shall in due time have a full and complete lesson in righteousness, that men may choose to do that which is right and receive God’s appoval and favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the great Jehovah it is written by his prophet: “Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance; behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; that bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. To Whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. ’ ’—Isa. 40:15,17, 22,23, 25, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures establish beyond any question of doubt the supremacy of Jehovah. The fact that he is all-powerful does not at all mean that he is responsible for the evil of this world. The question of the prevalence of evil is one of great importance to every thoughtful man and woman, and the clear answer to that question may now be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the present, however, it might be asked, Will Almighty God ever establish a just and righteous government for the people? and will he restrain Satan the wicked one that he may not interfere with the operations of a righteous government?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes. The proof is now abundant that God will do that very thing. The proof will enable everyone who seeks the truth to see that 1914 marks the turning point in the affairs of man for man’s betterment. The interests of all the peoples of earth are alike because God made all of one blood to dwell upon the earth. (Acts 17:26) Let the peoples of earth then cease from strife and controversy, lay aside all prejudices and, with a singleness of purpose to learn and know the truth, give diligence to the examination of the facts before them, which facts are now made plain in the light of the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The evidence shows that Jehovah God is the Supreme One and that he is just, wise, loving and allpowerful. Necessarily then, it follows that no righteous government of the people can be established except it be established in the manner God has ordained.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THREE METHODS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">HE great tempter to wickedness is Satan the Devil, who was originally the perfect, holy and godlike cherub named Lucifer. After his own fall into wrongdoing and rebellion against God he sought forthwith to bring about the downfall of others. He succeeded in so doing with Adam and Eve, the first parents of the human race. On that occasion Jehovah God pronounced the decree of destruction against Satan, and then uttered the judgment of death against the guilty Adam. Accordingly Adam was evicted from the garden of Eden. The record of the Lord discloses that only Eden was complete and perfect, and that all other portions of the earth were unfinished. The statement of God’s judgment upon Adam, to wit, “Cursed is the ground for thy sake,” means that the earth is unfinished for your sake. And why for man’s sake ? Because now he must go to that unfinished part of the earth which brought forth thorns and thistles, and by his own labor produce the food that was necessary for him. Work has always been a great favor to man. An idle person is of no good to himself nor to anyone else. It was therefore an act of loving-kindness on the part of God that he provided work for man.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>OF TEMPTATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">God sent man forth from Eden into that unfinished part of the earth and gave him work there for a period of nine hundred and thirty years, and during that time he would have ample opportunity to think about the terrible mistake he had made. Throughout that period he was gradually undergoing a process of death, and at the end thereof he was dead. Of course God could have killed Adam immediately, but it did not please him so to do; and subsequent revelations of God’s purposes show that the gradual death of Adam will ultimately result to the benefit of the human race and to the glory of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Eden there was a tree designated “the tree of life”, because God had named this tree thus; and it is manifest that the creatures whom he should permit to partake of that tree should live and not die. The virtue of life was not in the fruit of the tree. The tree and its fruit were symbols of life, and God’s law was and is that if anyone proves himself worthy to eat of the fruit of the tree of life, then that one shall live forever and not die. Had Adam proven faithful under the test to which he was put, doubtless he would have been permitted, in due time, to eat of the fruit of that tree of life; and thereby God would have testified to him that he was faithful and true and, as such, was entitled to everlasting life on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s law or rule of action never changes. Upon that point the principle of his law is expressed in Revelation, chapter two, verse seven, which reads: “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.” This rule must mean that any of the human family who will ever, under any condition, attain to life everlasting must be put to the test, and must be victors or overcomers in that test, and thereby prove themselves loyal and faithful; and thus gaining the victory they will be entitled to life everlasting. This is further proof that the tree of life is a symbol of life to those who are obedient unto God, and that none except the obedient will ever be granted life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The human organism is of flesh. The mind is the intelligence, or that faculty of the creature by which he reasons and reaches a conclusion. “Will” is that faculty of the creature by which the creature determines to do or not to do a certain thing. The temptation in Eden was presented to Eve in three forms; namely, a test of the flesh, a test of the mind, and a test of the will. She saw that the tree bore good fruit to eat; and she reasoned, ‘That would be good for my body, or organism. I will use my powers now for the gratification and welfare of my flesh.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And she saw that the fruit was pleasant to the eye. It appealed to her fancy, and she was pleased with its external appearance. It was beautiful to look upon and she desired it. Hence she said, ‘I will have this most beautiful fruit. ’ She saw also that it was a tree to be desired to make one wise. It appealed to her pride or her sense of her own importance and worth, and she desired to be wise even though before God’s time. She determined to exercise her will contrary to God’s will. Therefore she said, ‘I will eat and become wiser than other creatures, yea, even as wise as God himself.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Upon all three points Eve was tempted, and upon each one she yielded and fell. She was so impressed with her own importance that she gave the fruit to her husband, and he did eat. He did not want to be separated from her. He knew that what she had done would separate her from God, and he preferred to yield to the desire of his flesh rather than to be obedient to God, and he ate. He saw that she was beautiful, appealed to his eye; and he desired to possess her and to be with her; and he yielded upon this point. He knew that it was the will of God that he should not eat. He knew that he could exercise his own will contrary to God’s will and thus run ahead of Jehovah. Doubtless it was God’s purpose to let him eat of that fruit some time. To exercise his will in a selfish way Adam yielded upon this point. Upon all three of the temptations man fell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Subsequent revelations of God’s Word show that these three methods of temptation God has not hindered, and has permitted Satan to present in a subtle form to every one of the human family that has claimed to be in harmony with God. It is written in his Word; in the first epistle of John, chapter two, verses sixteen and seventeen, “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” This is further proof that anyone of the human family that is ever granted eternal life must be put to the test, and under the test prove his loyalty and faithfulness to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adam and Eve were expelled from their paradise home. They went out in disgrace and under the sentence of death. The Lord set a watch at the entrance of the garden to prevent their return. They had willfully broken the law of God, and now began their punishment which the law inflicted upon them. When in their Eden home their food was perfect. Outside of Eden grew thorns and thistles, and trees which produced poisonous foods. From these by laborious efforts they must obtain the food which in course of time would poison them, overcome them, and cause them to die. It was a dark day for them when they left Eden, and it continued dark. Their long journey of sorrow had begun. At the end of nine hundred and thirty years in darkness and sin Adam went down into the pit, and the earth closed over him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another part of God’s judgment was, as stated in Genesis, chapter three, verse sixteen: ‘ ‘ Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception: in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.” Six thousand years of the suffering of women in giving birth to children abundantly testify to the enforcement of this part of God’s judgment. The Lord had good reason for this punishment, and in due time it will prove a blessing to man. It was there expressed as the law of God that the woman must be subject to the man. There was good reason for that rule also. Because that rule has been so frequently violated, much suffering has resulted, and many families have been disrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Valuable lessons are usually dearly bought. For their own good God would have his creatures learn the lessons which he has provided for them. In due time all men must learn that Jehovah God does everything orderly. They will learn that man is the head of the woman, that Christ Jesus is the Head of his church, which is his bride, and that Jehovah God is Head of Christ and the Most High God over all. The enemy Satan has busied himself to see that this rule has been violated in almost all homes. He has made of the husband a beastly and vicious overlord, and it has thereby been easy to induce the woman to believe that she should not be subject to him. Discord and sorrow have been the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When God created Adam and Eve he said: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.” There he expressed his will that they should produce a race of their own kind, and for such human race he created the earth. When Adam and Eve left Eden they had not exercised this divinely-given function. Later, as Genesis, chapter four, verses one and two, shows, their children began to be born. What kind of children should be expected to be born of imperfect parents under the sentence of death? It must be borne in mind that Adam had no right to life, and therefore he could not transmit to his offspring the right to life. In addition to the absence of a right to life, Adam was undergoing the process of death, and it follows that his offspring under such circumstances could not be perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Both Adam and Eve now were sinners. Therefore their children must of necessity be born in sin. Later one of the prophets of God recorded Jehovah’s rule governing all cases, and this is stated in Psalm fifty-one, verse five, as follows: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” Upon this same point another of God’s inspired witnesses wrote, in Romans, chapter five, verse twelve, as follows: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” These scriptures, stating the rule of Jehovah, explain why all children have been born imperfect and without the right to life, and why in due course of time they become sick and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of this trouble has been caused by sin. And what is sin? First John, chapter three, verse four, replies that sin is a transgression of God’s law. All lawlessness, therefore, is sin. To be lawless means to be disloyal to God. Lucifer knew the law of God and broke it. Adam knew the law of God and he transgressed it. The wages or penalty for sin is death, so says Romans, chapter six, verse twenty-three. There is no departure from these rules, because God changes not. —Mal. 3:6.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark15"></a>LUCIFER AND THE TREE OF LIFE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">L</span><span class="font4">UCIFER was the holy cherub whom Jehovah God placed in the garden of Eden as the invisible overseer and overlord of the perfect man Adam. Becoming ambitious, Lucifer began to meditate how he might exalt and deify himself and make himself like the Most High God, Jehovah. Having carefully planned his crime, he now proceeds to carry it out. To do so he resorts to fraud, deception and lying. When the Logos, God's only begotten Son, was on the earth he stated that Lucifer “is a liar and the father of it [the lie] ” (John 8:44), thereby showing that Lucifer gave utterance to the first lie that was ever told. That lie is, “There is no death”; and the emissaries of the wicked one have been telling that lie to the people ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer employed the serpent to carry out his scheme, because the serpent was more subtle than any other beast of the field which the Lord God had made. Lucifer, therefore, spoke through the serpent and said to the perfect woman Eve: “Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. ’ ’—Gen. 3:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God had given his word that this tree produced a fruit that would increase the knowledge of those that ate it. The result was that when Adam and Eve did eat this forbidden fruit their knowledge was increased in harmony with God's announced law. They were now conscious of the fact that they had done wrong, because they hid themselves amongst the trees in the garden from the presence of the Lord. He brought them before him. They entered a plea of guilty, confessing that they had done wrong, and thereupon God entered against them the following judgment, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee: and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”—Gen. 3:16-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures mention three classes of fruit-bearing trees in the garden of Eden, to wit: (First, as mentioned) every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; (second) the tree of life in the midst of the garden; and (third) the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (Gen. 2:9) God told Adam that he might eat of all the trees that were good for him. The record reads thus: “And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”—Gen. 2:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no evidence that Adam knew anything about the tree of life that was in the midst of Eden. On the contrary, he must have been ignorant of it, because there was no specific command given to him concerning it. Lucifer, as the officer in charge, being clothed with the power of death and entrusted with the high office of overlord of man, would, of course, know all about the tree of life. The fact that God gave Adam command about other trees in the garden and said nothing about the tree of life is evidence that man knew nothing about this tree. The eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil doubtless would open the way so that Adam would shortly know about the tree of life. But now comes the proof showing conclusively that Adam had had no opportunity to eat of the tree of life and that therefore he must have been in ignorance of it until immediately before his expulsion from Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God summoned the guilty parties before him and, upon a full hearing of the facts, pronounced judgment against the woman and against the man and against the serpent which Lucifer (now Satan) had employed to deceive Eve. The final judgment against Lucifer or Satan is set forth in the prophecy of Ezekiel, and it provides that in due time he is to be destroyed and never shall be again. (Ezek. 28:11-19) Immediately following the pronouncement of the judgment against man God addressed someone, then and there present, and it seems almost certain that he was speaking to the Logos, his true and trusted Son. We read: “And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.”</span><span class="font4"> (Gen. 3: 22) Mark the words of Jehovah here recorded: “Man is become as one of us, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to know</span><span class="font4"> good and evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing the situation was critical God seemingly acted immediately, before man had an opportunity to get to the tree of life, and eat of it, and even before Lucifer had time to inform man of the location of the tree. The words addressed to the Logos were cut short; the sentence seemingly stops in the middle without being finished, to wit: “And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:—” Note the record. God did not speak another word, but acted immediately; and his action is recorded in the next verse, which reads: “Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground whence he was taken. So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. ’ ’—Gen. 3: 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was doubtless God’s purpose at some time to permit man to partake of the tree of life and live for ever and, had he proven faithful under the test, that would have been his reward. Lucifer, therefore, caused him to fail in the test, caused him to fail to get life, and caused him to bring upon himself and all of his progeny the great sorrow and distress that has afflicted humankind down through the centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer had manifested his unfaithfulness and treachery and doubtless intended to act as quickly as possible and lead man to the tree of life and let him eat of that fruit. He knew that God had given his word that the fruit of that tree was a fruit of life, and that if man should eat of it he would live and not die. Lucifer, therefore, reasoned that he would be able to prove to Adam and Eve that God was purposely deceiving them and keeping them in ignorance and keeping them away from the opportunity for life; and that he, Lucifer, was telling them the truth and was bringing them a great blessing, and that hence he was entitled to be worshiped by them and by all of their offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had Adam eaten of that fruit of the tree of life immediately he could not have been put to death by Jehovah himself, because God cannot be inconsistent. God had given his word that this is a tree of life; and for him to permit man to eat of it and then put him to death would make void his word, which is impossible for God to do. (Ps. 138:2; Isa. 46:11; 55:11) Therefore, in order that God might keep his word inviolate and enforce his judgment against Adam he immediately expelled him from Eden and set a powerful officer on guard with a flaming sword turning in every direction, to keep man out of Eden and away from the tree of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why did not God kill Lucifer at the time? Other scriptures show that it was and is the purpose of God that all his intelligent creatures shall observe and learn the great truth that he is Jehovah the fountain of life and truth, and that Lucifer and his sin will serve as a means of testing other creatures, to prove their integrity toward God. In due time every intelligent creature of God will have an opportunity under full and fair conditions to follow the course of Lucifer and take the consequences, or to follow the righteous commands of God and receive the reward of being permitted to partake of the tree of life and live for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why did not God kill man forthwith ? Other scriptures show that man at that time had not exercised his powers to beget children. No children were born. Furthermore, the Scriptures show that it is God’s purpose to vindicate his righteous name and to prove to all creation that he can put a man or men on this earth who will maintain their integrity toward him even in an environment of great wickedness, temptation and suffering for righteousness’ sake. Hence Jehovah God permitted Adam to continue on earth nine hundred and thirty years, during which time he begat and brought forth his children. Now he has permitted a sufficient length of time to elapse for the birth of a sufficient number of Adam’s posterity to populate the earth. All of these have suffered from the baneful effects of sin, eventuating in death; but in due time they shall come forth and be brought to a knowledge of the truth, that they may know that the Most High God is Jehovah, and may also know the reason why they have suffered. Then they shall have an opportunity to abide in sin and suffer eternal destruction or to follow the righteous commands of God and live for ever. Otherwise stated, God’s purpose is to teach the entire human race the supreme truth that Jehovah is God alone and the only source of life, that thus his name may be vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adam was sentenced to death. This sentence was enforced against him by compelling him to eat of the fruits of the unfinished part of the earth, which gradually resulted in his death. Within that period of nine hundred and thirty years his children were brought forth. While these were not formally sentenced to death, they were all born sinners. The imperfect Adam, undergoing the death sentence, could not beget perfect children. Hence it is written by the psalmist: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.” (Ps. 51:5) To the same effect is the Apostle Paul’s statement in his letter to the Romans, chapter five, verse twelve: ‘ ‘ Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. ’ ’ Thus are seen the terrible and far-reaching effects of this rebellion. It has brought all the suffering and sorrow, sickness and death, wars, famines and pestilences to which humankind have been heir during the past six thousand years. The very first son that Adam had was a murderer, and Lucifer the Devil induced him to commit the murder; therefore Lucifer was a party to the crime. Lucifer is guilty of every murder that has ever been committed on this earth. In the judgment pronounced in the garden of Eden Jehovah God declared that the end of Lucifer should be utter destruction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Greetings in Zion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have been for some time thinking of sending in our thanks and appreciation of the love and kindness of the Lord shown us, and in his using you as an instrument in his service in presenting the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> to us, and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">My, how wonderful the table of the Lord is filled with food convenient, and that just before Armageddon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We were privileged to be at the Columbus convention and unreservedly adopt the resolution, and by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and of our heavenly Father we joyfully receive and bear the name which Jehovah has given us, “Jehovah’s witnesses. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We will do the Lord’s will in regard to giving the warning to the rulers. We are so thankful that we have the privilege and see our duty in giving the warnings. It has brought on us persecution, but we are so thankful to suffer persecution with our Head. By the Lord’s grace we will be obedient children in keeping his commandments. In so doing we are singing praises to his name, honor and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No doubt the Haman class are now planning our defeat; but there will be no defeat for those who put full confidence in our Lord and Jehovah and look for a full deliverance, even though it means in death we will sing honor and praise to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the year’s Calendar picture we see the two armies standing face to face; and from all appearance the little army of Jehovah is nothing in power, from the natural viewpoint. But when viewed from the spiritual standpoint there is nothing that can move us who are of the Lord’s army. As with Israel in the picture of the Assyrian army that surrounded them, the slaying came over night, we may see the same in this oncoming slaughter. This is a word to show our appreciation of your full allegiance in the service of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We pray for his strength for all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Were it not for one of Jehovah’s witnesses, I would be today in the depths of despair. I buried my dear little three-year-old daughter one year ago; and after three months of grieving, with no minister able to give me one real comforting word, one of these witnesses stopped at my door and with a beautiful smile told me of God’s wonderful purpose. And to think that I had been searching for the truth for twenty years in the churches!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So your books, with mv Bible, have been food for a starving soul; and I keep a full supply of books and booklets on hand at all times, to give to the sad and discouraged and to those who wonder what is wrong with the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Be it resolved that, by the grace of Jehovah, we will gladly cooperate in the witness work now in progress and be ready to join in the service yet to be rendered. We shall be glad to receive instructions from headquarters as to the selection of company leaders, now known as elders, and until then we shall continue our present arrangements.</span></p>
