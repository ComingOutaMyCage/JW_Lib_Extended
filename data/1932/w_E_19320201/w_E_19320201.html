<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark6"></a>THE ROCK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Fear ye not, neither &quot;be afraid: have I not declared unto thee of old, and showed it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.”—Isa. 44:8, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH must from henceforth be made known to his creatures. For many centuries his name has been pushed on the side and a very few amongst men have known him. Even those who have been devoted to God since the days of the apostles have given more consideration to Christ Jesus the Son than to Jehovah the Father. Manifestly, Satan the enemy succeeded in a measure in turning the attention of the true followers of Christ away from God by inducing them to worship the Son to the exclusion of Jehovah. Jesus had told his disciples that they who obtain life must know Jehovah the Father, and Christ Jesus the Son ■ but after the days of the apostles men were quickly caused to ignore Jehovah. (John 17:3) Another step and the adversary had men worshiping imperfect men and praying even to women to the exclusion of God and Christ Jesus. True, many pronounced the name of God and of Christ, but they gave their honor to the man. In these last days Jehovah has revealed himself more fully to his anointed sons on earth, and now it is their duty to bear testimony that Jehovah is God and besides him there is none other. They must give consideration to the Scriptures and then use their knowledge wisely by telling others that Jehovah is the Supreme One and that Christ Jesus is the Chief One of Jehovah’s eternal organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> In many places of the Bible mention is made of a great Rock. The word used to translate “rock” means a great cliff or mass of rock. In the work of creation the great Creator brought forth mountains before the soil was formed, and therefore the mountains were composed of a great mass of rock. Sometimes the word ‘mountains’ is applied to an entire range of mountains. Jehovah is the great Rock of Eternity. The mountain of rock is not only symbolic of Jehovah himself, but also symbolic of his universal organization. Consideration of some proof texts will be profitable in this study. In Deuteronomy Moses wrote: ‘ ‘ Give ear, 0 ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, 0 earth, the words of my mouth. Because I will publish the name of the Lord; ascribe ye greatness unto our God. He is the Rock, his work is perfect ; for all his ways are judgment; a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.”—Deut. 32:1, 3,</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah told the Israelites that he had brought them forth as his people and that they had forsaken him for others. “Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.” (Deut. 32:18) This is further supported by the words at 1 Samuel 2:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font4">: “There is none holy as Jehovah; for there is none besides thee: neither is there any rock like our God.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">* Jehovah is the source of life. Salvation from the enemy is provided by Jehovah. He is the refuge and fortress for those who fully trust in him. When Jehovah had delivered David from the cruel hand of Saul, who represented the enemy Satan and his wicked organization, the spirit of the Lord moved David to write: “I love thee, 0 Jehovah, my strength. Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. I will call upon Jehovah, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.” (Ps. 18:1-3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> David there spoke prophetically of the protection and deliverance from the enemy which Jehovah has provided for his people in the last days, where we now are, and when Satan the enemy is making war against those who keep the commandments of God and to whom is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ. The prophet, further speaking concerning the great servant of Jehovah, of whom the anointed now on earth are privileged to be a part, and referring to the time when the battle is approaching, says: ‘ ‘ For who is God save the Lord ? or who is a rock save our God? It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places. He teachcth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. The Lord liveth: and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, 0 Lord, among the [nations], and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">sing praises unto thy namc.”-Ps. 18: 31-34, 46, 47, 49.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Among the last words that the Prophet David wrote were these: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.” (2 Sam. 23:2,3) In all these texts it will be observed that Jehovah is referred to as the great Rock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The Scriptures show that in these last days Jehovah would enlighten his people concerning himself more fully than heretofore. This he has done in harmony with his promise. In the following texts Jehovah reveals himself as the Rock and fortress, the shield and protection provided for those who are devoted to him. “For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion: in the covert of his tabernacle will he hide me; he will lift me up upon a rock.” (Ps. 27:5, A.R.V.) “Unto thee, 0 Jehovah, will I call: my rock, be not thou deaf unto me; lest, if thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit.” (28:1, A.R.V.) “For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me and guide me.” (31: 3, A.R.V.) “My soul waiteth in silence for God only: from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my high tower; I shall not be moved. With God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.”—62:1,2,6,7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Furthermore, God’s children by his woman, and who therefore form a part of his “servant”, must in these last days show forth the righteousness of Jehovah by bearing testimony of him. These must know that Jehovah is the great Rock and make this known to others. “They are planted in the house of Jehovah ; they shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to show that Jehovah is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.” (Ps. 92:13-15, A.R.V.) Verse fourteen last above quoted refers to the mature followers of Christ Jesus as full of vigor and life, actively representing Jehovah God. With confidence his anointed, who continue faithful to their covenant and commission, in the language of God’s prophet speak of their deliverance from the enemy by their great Rock and say: “They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But Jehovah hath been my high tower, and my God the rock of my refuge. And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, and will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.” (Ps. 94:21-23, A.R.7.) These faithful ones praise their Rock, and thus they sing: “Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.”—Ps. 95:1, A.R.F.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The fact that Jehovah in our day has brought to the attention of his anointed ones that he is the mighty Rock is further circumstantial proof that we are now in the last days and that the faithful sons of God must now be his witnesses in the earth and declare his name and his works to others. The time has come when mankind must know that Jehovah is God. Only the anointed who are Jehovah’s witnesses will now refrain from the worship of men and will magnify the name of Jehovah God, making known to the people that he is the only true and almighty One. The Most High now speaks to his faithful ones through his prophet and says: “Thus saith Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and besides me there is no God. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I established the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare. Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have I not declared unto thee of old, and showed it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God besides me? yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.”—Isa. 44:6-8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> The words of the prophet here show that the time has come to settle the great issue that has been pending for centuries, and therefore the time when all creation must know that Jehovah is the great God and that there is no Rock besides him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> All the creation of Jehovah God is perfect and orderly, and his universal organization, symbolized by the great rock or mountain range composed of a mass of rock, is now by him brought in a forceful way to the attention of his people. He refers to the foundations of his great organization as the “mountains”. “His foundation is in the holy mountains.” (Ps. 87:1) This means that his universal organization is as solid and eternal as the mountain ranges. Lucifer at one time was a part of God’s organization; but he rebelled and became God’s enemy, and God cast him out of his organization, and he (Satan) then built an organization in opposition to that of Jehovah. (Ezek. 28:16-19) Satan’s organization is pictured or symbolized by Egypt. God’s chosen people were residing in Egypt, and the Egyptian ruler as Satan’s representative greatly oppressed them. Moses was chosen by Jehovah to deliver his people out of Egypt and lead them into a place of safety. Jehovah spoke to Moses in Mount Horeb, which is called “the mount of God”. (Ex. 3:1,12; 1 Ki. 19:8) Jehovah told Moses that his chosen people must be brought out of Egypt (Satan’s organization) and that they should come and worship Jehovah “upon this mountain”. This is proof that Mount Horeb was a symbol of God’s organization and meant that God’s people must leave Satan’s organization and come and worship Jehovah, if they would live. It was there at Mount Horeb that God confirmed a covenant with the Israelites; and the New Testament bears testimony to the fact that the mountain pictures Jehovah’s organization or government. (Heb. 12: 24-29) In further support of this it is written: “And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.”— Ps. 78:54.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The Scriptures then show that Jehovah God takes out from his universal organization a “seed” that becomes the chief part or capital of his organization. It is an organization within itself, but is exalted above all other parts of Jehovah’s organization. By his prophet he says: “And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. ’ ’—Isa. 65: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> This high or capital part of the great organization of Jehovah is symbolized by Mount Zion wherein Jehovah dwells and to which he brings men that they might be reconciled to him. “Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.” (Ps. 74:2) “In Judah is God known; his name is great in Israel. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwellingplace in Zion.” (Ps. 76:1,2) “For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.” (Ps. 132:13) Christ Jesus has always been the Chief One of Jehovah’s universal organization and by him Jehovah caused all things to be created that have been created. Jehovah by his prophet announced his purpose to create an organization specifically for his beloved Son, which becomes the capital or ruling part over all of his organization. In other words, Jehovah distinguishes his Son and honors him with a specific creation of which he is the Head and which has rule, as Jehovah’s representative, over all creation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> God caused his prophet Daniel to prophesy concerning Satan’s organization, mentioning it under the figure or symbol of a terrible image. At the same time this prophecy discloses ‘a stone cut out of the mountain without hands and which breaks in pieces’ and destroys that terrible image. That Stone and mighty Rock, which is the express image of the Rock Eternal, is Christ Jesus, God’s anointed King. This is the ‘seed of promise’. To “cut out” means to bring forth something new. This Jehovah God does by taking out from his universal organization (symbolized by the mountain or great Rock) a solid Roek, which grows and becomes a great mountain and fills the whole earth. (Dan. 2: 34-45) That which is taken out of the mass of rock or mountain must of necessity be rock or stone, hence the name “stone” mentioned by the prophet Daniel applies specifically to Christ the King. The cutting out or taking out is not done by hands, but by the will of God. Jehovah purposed it, and he has brought it to pass. The Scriptures disclose the mode of procedure employed by Jehovah in cutting out this Stone from the mountain. He sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth to redeem mankind from death. At the time that Jesus appeared at the Jordan for baptism Jehovah brought him forth and acknowledged him as his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased. Shortly thereafter he anointed Christ Jesus as the Ruler of the world. Christ Jesus there became “The Seed” which Jehovah had caused his prophet to declare should inherit his mountain or become the Ruler of the world and the Head of his great organization; as it is written by the prophet: “An inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.” (Isa. 65:9) At the time of the anointing of Christ Jesus as King, he was thin that ‘Stone cut out of the mountain without hands’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah then caused Jesus Christ to be presented to the Israelites, who were his covenant people. He preached to them exclusively for more than three years concerning the kingdom of God, and then in the prescribed form he presented himself to them as King. This he did near the conclusion of his earthly ministry, and at that time he had been severely tried by the wicked works of the Devil. When he rode into Jerusalem on the ass and presented himself as King, that was the laying of the Stone in Zion which is God’s organization. It was not the complete laying of the Stone, but the miniature laying, the greater taking place later. Concerning this God’s prophet wrote: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste.” (Isa. 28:16) The Israelites there rejected Christ Jesus and caused him to be crucified. By his death the ransom price for man was provided. The death of Christ Jesus did not at all nullify the laying of The Stone in miniature. It was God's purpose to later complete the laying of this great Stone, and which has been done.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah raised up Christ Jesus out of death and exalted him to heaven but did not at that time set him upon the throne of authority. Later he told him that he must wait until the time to make the enemy his footstool. (Ps. 110:1) That period of waiting ended in 1914, and it was then that the prophecy was fulfilled, to wit: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6) It was there and at that time that ‘The Stone cut out of the mountain of God without hands’ began his rule as King. Now this mighty King speaks and announces the decree or judicial determination of Jehovah which had been previously written, to wit: “I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.” (Ps. 2:7,8,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> This prophecy spoken by David corresponds exactly with that of Daniel concerning the cutting out of the Stone from the mountain and its ruling the whole world. Immediately following the time of the beginning of Christ Jesus’ rule a war began in heaven, which war resulted in a victory for Christ and the defeating and easting of Satan out of heaven. (Rev. 12: 7-10) Then this mighty Rock or Stone, the express image of the Rock Eternal, appeared at the temple of the Rock Eternal for judgment. At the same time earth’s rightful Ruler appeared himself as King to all the world that called upon his name. The nations called ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ were in an implied covenant to do the will of God, because of their own course of action. All the truly consecrated on earth were in a covenant to do the will of God, looking for the kingdom. Jehovah God’s sending his beloved Son, the great King and Judge, to his temple for judgment, and the presenting of him as King, was the laying of the Stone in Zion in completion. That Stone was then rejected by Christendom and many who professed to be Christ’s, even as the prophet had foretold and as the Jews had rejected Christ Jesus. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy: “And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel; for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.” (Isa. 8:14) This mighty Rock, earth’s rightful King, and which Jehovah The Rock Eternal had taken out from his “mountain”, then and there became the sanctuary to those found faithful at the beginning of judgment, and also became “a rock of offence” to the hypocrites and selfish ones who had taken the name of Christ. The hypocrisy and selfishness of these made them easy victims to be entrapped by Satan; and their rejection of Christ, The Stone, the great King, and of his kingdom, caused them to stumble and fall, to be ensnared and broken. The Jews stumbled and fell in A.D. 33. The professed followers of Christ stumbled and fell in A.D. 1918. Following the stumbling of the Jews Jerusalem was completely destroyed. It is certain that Christendom will be completely destroyed in the very near future. It is only recently that God’s people have come to an understanding of the meaning of the term “The Rock” and of the ‘Rock cut out of the mountain without hands’; and the hiding of these truths for so long a time has been due to the wicked influence that Satan has exercised over the minds of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S COUNTERFEIT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Satan is the most wily of foes. His cunning and sagacity are unsurpassed. He is unscrupulous and wicked to the superlative degree. He has used false teachers to induce millions of persons who were seeking life to believe that the Apostle Peter is the foundation of the church of God and that the numerous imperfect men who have been exalted to the place of pope of the Roman heirarchy are the successors of Peter in office, and that therefore the pope has primary authority over the church and the sole power to interpret the Scriptures. This counterfeit thing Satan has builded by his cunning and sagacity, fraud and deceit, for the very purpose of blinding the people to the truth. Thus Satan has turned millions of unfortunate creatures away from God and led them into blasphemy and the worship of men. As a basis for this wrongful claim, and as a bait to induce the people to give worshipful support to imperfect men, the agents of Satan have employed the words of Jesus as follows, to wit: “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” —Matt. 16:18,19.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> As proof that these words of Christ Jesus have been woefully misused and the name of God and Christ blasphemed the following is cited. Cardinal Gibbons, a very noted man in the papal church, wrote a book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Faith of Our Fathers.</span><span class="font4"> Commenting on the above text this learned gentleman, in his book, at pages ninety-two and following, says: “Here we find Peter confessing the divinity of Christ, and in reward for that confession he is honored with the promise of the primacy. . . . The Catholic church teaches also that our Lord conferred upon Saint Peter the first place of honor and jurisdiction of the government of his holy church, and that the same spiritual supremacy has always resided in the popes or bishops of Rome as being the successors of Saint Peter. Consequently to be true followers of Christ Jesus all Christians, both among the clergy and the laity, must be in communion with the See of Rome, where Peter rules in the person of his successor. . . . To my mind the New Testament establishes no doctrine unless it satisfies every candid reader that our Lord gave plenipotentiary powers to Peter to govern the whole church.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Blasphemy is properly defined as offering indignity to Jehovah God by claiming for a creature the attributes and authority that belong exclusively to the Lord. The claim that the Lord conferred upon Peter the first place of honor and jurisdiction for the government of the whole church, and conferred upon Peter plenipotentiary powers, and that the popes are the divinely arranged successors of Peter, and that all true Christians must be in communion with the See of Rome, constitutes the very worst kind of blasphemy. It is easy to be seen that the false claim originated with the Devil, whose purpose was and is to induce mankind to worship creatures in order to divert their attention and worship from Jehovah God the great Creator. This has been one of the most subtle schemes by which Satan has led millions into darkness; but it seems that the time has come when many of these now shall have an opportunity to see the light, learn the truth, and take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and give honor and worship to Him to whom honor and worship are due. They must come to know that Jehovah is God. It is important therefore for God’s witnesses to have this matter clearly in mind that they may be able to teach others who want to know the truth, because Jehovah’s witnesses are now made leaders of the people.—Isa. 55: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah God is supreme over the church which is his. It is “the church of the living God”. (1 Tim. 3:15) Jehovah God made Christ Jesus the Head over the church, which is his body. (Eph. 1:17-23) Jehovah God laid Christ Jesus as the foundation or chief corner Stone of the church, and the whole structure is God’s building. (1 Cor. 3:9-11) In the context above cited the apostle declares that “other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Christ Jesus”. Jehovah God sets the members in the body as it pleases him, because it is his building and his organization hewn out from his great Rock, which is his eternal organization.—1 Cor. 12:18; Isa. 51:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The keys which the Lord stated to Peter that he would give him, and which he did give him afterwards, were the keys of knowledge concerning the royal family of heaven, or the elect organization of Jehovah. It was the privilege given to Peter of receiving this knowledge by the power of the spirit of God and then to unlock or make known the mystery of Christ to others. The very language of the text shows there were two keys. The first key he used at Pentecost, when, under the power of the holy spirit, Peter made known to the Jews the mystery of the kingdom of God, showing that Christ is the Head and the foundation. The second key Peter used to unlock and make known the same great truths to the Gentiles, when he was sent to Cornelius. (Acts 2:14-40; 10:1-44) How would it be possible for anyone to be the successor of Peter in this or any other work that was assigned exclusively to him? The fact that the Lord gave Peter this privilege and Peter did the work under the power and direction of the holy spirit, finished and completed it, conclusively proves that Peter could not have a successor. The claim, therefore, that Peter is the foundation stone of the church and is given primary authority over the church, and that the popes are his successors, is entirely false and blasphemous. In order to maintain this false and blasphemous claim it was necessary for Satan to induce the people to believe that this referred to Peter, when he said, “Upon this [stone] I will build my church.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Nor is it correct to say that it was the truth declared by Peter concerning Christ the Son of God upon which the church is built. It was much more than merely a declaration of truth. Whatsoever Peter uttered on that occasion he uttered by the power of the spirit of God. Jesus was giving instruction to his disciples and had warned them to beware of the doctrines of the Pharisees. Then he propounded to all of his disciples this question; “Whom do men say that I . . . am?” Their answers to him were: ‘Some say you are Jeremiah; and some, Elijah; some say you are others.’ Then Jesus propounded this further question to them: ‘But who do ye say that I am?’ The pronoun “ye” in the solemn form here shows that Jesus spoke to the disciples collectively and did not direct his question specifically to Peter. Probably some of the others answered. Peter’s answer was this: “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” The substance of the reply of Jesus to Peter’s statement was this: ‘Peter, no man told you that, but my Father in heaven revealed unto you this truth.’ There is not anything in the language of Jesus to indicate that he conferred any power whatsoever upon Peter except the privilege and power of unlocking the mystery of the kingdom of heaven to the Jews and to the Gentiles and the declaration of Jesus that this would be confirmed in heaven.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TRUE MEANING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> What, then, did Jesus mean to convey to the mind of Peter and to others of his disciples present concerning the Stone, when he used the words “Upon this [stone] I will build my church”? We must assume that the disciples were familiar with what Moses and the prophets had written, because it was incumbent upon them to learn the text of the Scriptures, and, furthermore, Jesus had been instructing them for some time. After receiving the holy spirit these faithful men bore testimony which shows what Jesus did mean. Moses and the prophets had written that Jehovah God is the Eternal Rock besides whom there is none other. Repeatedly in the Scriptures God had caused to be written that he would send a Seed, which Seed should rule the whole world. By his prophet Daniel he had told that he would cut out of his great mass of rock, his mountain, a Stone, which Stone should grow and rule the whole world. The Seed and the ‘Stone cut out of the mountain without hands’ were one and the same. At the time of the conversation between Jesus and his disciples that Stone had already been cut out of God’s universal organization, because Jesus at that time was the anointed King. Necessarily Jesus would have in inind these prophetic statements written in the Scriptures at the time he made the statement to his disciples. Jesus, therefore, said to his disciples, in substance: ‘I am that great promised Stone, because my Father in heaven sent me and he has anointed me as King and has made me the foundation and Chief One of his royal family; and upon myself, as the anointed King of Jehovah God, I will build my church which is my body. These shall constitute the kingdom, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’ While he was with his disciples on earth Jesus further said to them: ‘My Father has made a covenant with me to give me the kingdom; and now I invite you into the covenant, that you may share the kingdom with me and become a part of it.’ (Luke 22:28-30) Therefore it was not any declaration of truth that Peter made that constituted the foundation upon which the church was to be built; and certain it is that Peter himself was not referred to as being that Stone, even though Peter’s name signifies ‘a sharp piece of stone’. Jehovah God’s beloved Son, then the anointed King, was the great Stone that had been cut out or taken out of Jehovah’s universal organization, symbolized by his rock mountain, and that Jehovah had made the foundation of the church; and to that Stone thus taken out Jesus referred, when he said: “Upon this rock I will build my church.” Since he made no reference to Peter, it would be utterly impossible for him to have any reference to the popes of Rome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Jesus sent his disciples into the land to be his witnesses, and at least two of them gave testimony as to the true meaning of the words of Jesus concerning the Rock, and this shows what was the understanding of Peter as well as the others. Doubtless Jesus uttered many words of instruction to his disciples, the true meaning of which they could not have until after receiving the holy spirit. Shortly after receiving the holy spirit Peter delivered his testimony. Before the rulers of Jerusalem Peter testified concerning the power by which he was then doing good, and in this testimony he named Christ Jesus the anointed One as the great Stone. “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.” (Acts 4:10,11) Peter did not claim to be the foundation or chief one in the church. He could not so testify, because his testimony would then have been false. He did testify that all the body members of the church are living stones built up into the royal house. “If ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious, ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that belicveth on him shall not be put to shame. For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the head of the corner; and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.”—! Pet. 2:3-8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> In the testimony of Peter last above quoted he quotes from the Prophet Isaiah; and since he said that God had selected this Chief Corner Stone, we must assume that Peter had in mind the words of Moses and of Daniel, that Jehovah is the Rock Eternal, and that he had taken out from his universal organization this Chief Stone to be the foundation and the Head of his own organization, which should be the capital of God’s universal organization and which shall rule the world. God and Christ are one, as Jesus declared, and the body members are likewise one in organization, and therefore are called ‘living stones’ built up into God’s building, and which constitutes his royal family. The testimony of Peter supported by the prophets brands the claim of the papacy as a blasphemous falsehood created and brought forth by the fertile liar Satan and promulgated for the purpose of turning the people away from Jehovah God and blinding them to the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Paul, another witness for the Lord, testified that Jehovah God laid Christ Jesus as the chief foundation Stone in the building of his royal house, the church, and which shall rule the world. His testimony shows that Christ Jesus has supremacy in the church. (Eph. 1:22,23; 5:23; Col. 1:18) Paul also quotes the Prophet Isaiah to show that Christ Jesus is the chief Corner Stone of God’s capital organization. (Rom. 9:33) Further, Paul testified: ‘ ‘ Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.” (Eph. 2:19-22) These two inspired witnesses of Jehovah fully corroborate the words uttered by Jesus to his disciples, that Christ himself is the foundation Rock upon which is builded the church. The apostles are pillars and living stones in that structure, and now all the living stones are being gathered together and made a part of the building which belongs to God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> The papal organization boasts of being the strongest in Christendom in membership and in power; but what a deceived and blinded multitude it is! The strongest amongst men have been inveigled into this masterpiece of the Devil, and these have been used as instruments to blind many millions who really have a desire to see righteousness established in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> But now the time has come when the people must know the truth. It is the time of judgment, and the decree written against Christendom shall shortly be enforced, and then, as Jehovah declares, “they shall know that I am God.” The Eternal Rock has laid in completion his precious Stone in Zion, and now the mighty Christ Jesus is proceeding with his judgment upon the nations. Concerning this time Jehovah’s prophet wrote: “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28:17) The clear and indisputable truths are here symbolized by hail, and which truths are now being hurled at the enemy; and soon all hiding places of lies shall be exposed, and blindness that is upon mankind shall be swept away before the ever rising flood of truth. The people must know that Jehovah is God. He is the Rock Eternal.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPREGNABLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> At the same time that Jesus told his disciples that he was the solid Rock upon which his church shall be built he also said: “And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.” Satan has long had the power of death and has sent millions into hell, or the tomb, the condition of death. (Heb. 2:14) For centuries the Devil has used every known fraudulent scheme and device to turn the people away from God and Christ and to destroy God’s anointed. Now Jehovah has set his King upon the top of his holy mountain and made him the Chief One of his organization. To this mighty mountain or citadel of God Satan now is gathering all of his forces to engage in the great and final battle of Armageddon. Christ Jesus and the 144,000 are gathered together to the Mount of God; that is to say, Christ and his resurrected body members are in heavenly glory in that organization, and the anointed members on earth are his representatives and witnesses here. We are now in the last days, and God’s great Stone is exalted above all the nations and preparation for the great battle of the day of God Almighty proceeds. Before that battle breaks in all of its fury, however, Jehovah God would have the people told of certain great truths. He first calls the attention of his faithful ones, the true followers of Christ Jesus, to these truths and gives them a clear understanding thereof. To these is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ, and it is their privilege and duty to deliver this testimony. To these Jehovah now says: ‘You are my witnesses that I am God. You must bear testimony to the truth and against the enemy organization until the land is utterly made desolate.’ (Isa. 43:10-12; 44: 8; 6: 9-12) The remnant now on earth must carry this testimony of truth to the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Among the truths of first importance that the witnesses of Jehovah must first learn and then tell to others are these: Jehovah is the Eternal Rock that can never be shaken; Jehovah and his organization are the impregnable fortress that the enemy can never successfully assault; out from this eternal organization Jehovah has cut The Stone, which is the Head and foundation upon which the church or kingdom class is builded; and the truth of and concerning the kingdom must now be told to the people. The fraudulent system of papacy has long been the refuge or hiding place of the lies concerning The Rock. The papal organization is one of the strong battering-rams employed by the Devil to assault the fortress of the Lord, but it can never prevail against that impregnable stronghold. The Lord will now use his mighty truth to sweep away the refuge of lies and make known the truth to the people. The “feet” of Christ, the chief Rock, and who are living stones, are now above the kingdoms of this world; but they fear neither man nor devil, because they are standing upon the everlasting foundation. As the prophet declares, they together lift up the voice and sing the song of praise to the name of Jehovah, bringing to the attention of the people the message of salvation and telling the people that God’s kingdom is at hand.—Isa. 52:7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Considered from every viewpoint, the kingdom of Jehovah is the pinnacle of his creation because by and through it the name and Word of The Rock Eternal will be vindicated. That kingdom is now here and has begun to function. The enemy has assembled all ol his power against it, but it is impossible for the combined forces of the'wicked one to prevail against that kingdom. The mighty Rock, cut out from The Rock Eternal, soon will dash to pieces Satan’s forces, and his kingdom supreme shall stand forever. (Dan. 2:44) The kingdom of God under Christ is built upon the solid foundation Stone; it is anchored for ever in the Rock Eternal. The other stones are built up and form a part of the royal family, and these are secure because in the secret place of the Most High and free from all harm. Jehovah will now give to his faithful servant class a knowledge of these facts, and he lays upon such the duty to diligently make known these truths to the peoples of earth and to tell them in particular that there is no Rock besides Jehovah God and that his kingdom will vindicate his name, lift the burdens from the people that have so long weighed them down, and lead them into the way of life everlasting, and that his kingdom, being impregnable and righteous, shall stand forever to his honor and glory.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark8"></a>SOURCE OF MAN’S DELIVERANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">P</span><span class="font4">AUL the apostle was one of the inspired witnesses of God who wrote a portion of the Lord’s Word, the Bible. At the time Paul wrote more than four thousand years had passed since the tragedy of man in the garden of Eden. During that period the peoples had suffered, and continue to suffer, bodily pain and mental anguish, sorrow, sickness and death, being in bondage to the great oppressor, Satan. Knowing of this, and having likewise experienced much of it, Paul wrote: ‘‘For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.” (Rom. 8:22) At the same time, quoting from the Prophet Isaiah (59:20), he said: “There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer.”— Rom. 11:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Zion is the name applied to God’s organization, his universal organization. It is plainly written that out from God’s organization, Zion, shall come the Deliverer of the human race. Hence, if a man really believes that Jehovah God exists and that he is the Almighty God, the Most High, the Creator of heaven and earth, that he is all powerful and is the very expression of love, and that he has promised deliverance to the human race, then why should man look to any other source for deliverance? It is clearly manifest that Satan the enemy, for a selfish purpose, has deceived mankind, and that in selfishness and wickedness he has strenuously opposed every effort looking to man’s relief. It must appeal to every reasonable mind that none other aside from Almighty God, through his organization, can provide deliverance of man from his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Evolutionists teach that the remedy for man’s uplift is by his own efforts, and that he needs no Savior or Deliverer. Such teaching is not only unreasonable, but upon the face of it shows that it emanates from the Devil, and that he puts forth such a theory for the very purpose of deceiving the people and turning them away from God and away from his arrangement for man’s deliverance. Every sane man, from experience as well as from observation, knows that he and all other men are imperfect. Not only that, but every one must know that he is sinful. How ean man be relieved from these imperfections? God answers: “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: Though j’our sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”—Isa. 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that God asked man to reason with him shows that he is not going to arbitrarily deliver man and give to him blessings without man’s consent. If the destiny of man is fixed, without regard to whether he accepts or rejects the provision made for him, then there would be no occasion for him to reason with the Lord. This for ever puts to silence the theory of predestination of every creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, the fact that God invites man to reason upon the question of his salvation is conclusive proof that God’s provision for man’s salvation is reasonable, not a foolish one as some would make it appear. Again, the Devil deceives many who say: ‘No matter what a man believes, just so long as he is honest in his belief, that is sufficient. The belief of one is as good as that of another.’ One man says: ‘My parents were good Catholics, and their religion is good enough for me.’ Another says: ‘My mother was a Methodist, and her religion is good enough for me.’ The parents of both the Catholic and the Methodist may have been equally honest; but it is absolutely certain that not both could have been right, because their theories of salvation are very different. How then should we determine what to do? The Lord answers: ‘Come, reason with me in the light of my Word, and I will show you the way to life.’ Jesus adds: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To reason means to arrive at a just conclusion, by starting at a premise or fixed basis and step by step applying the known facts according to fixed princi-pies or rules of action. A principle is a rule of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question at issue is the salvation of man. The premise is: Man is imperfect, in a dying condition, suffering in his present condition and desiring deliverance therefrom. That is conceded by all. The conclusion is: God’s purpose provides for complete relief, by arranging for deliverance of man from all these disabilities and for his complete restoration to life and happiness. The facts upon which this conclusion is reached are set forth in the Word of God, the Bible, which is true because it is the Word of the Infinite and Eternal One. These facts are supplemented by things that each intelligent person sees and experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The primary attributes that are inherent in Jehovah are wisdom, justice, love and power, working always harmoniously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Man was created in the image and likeness of God, in that God endowed him with these attributes of wisdom, justice, love and power. While it is true that man failed and is greatly degenerated, yet every sane, intelligent man retains in some degree the image of God and possesses in a small degree some justice, some wisdom, some love and some power. These attributes he must learn to exercise harmoniously. He cannot exercise them perfectly, but he can exercise them to some extent nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That which goes to make up every man is mind, will, heart and organism. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mind</span><span class="font4"> is that faculty of the creature by which man searches out facts, weighs and considers those facts, and reaches a conclusion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Will</span><span class="font4"> is that faculty by which man determines to do or not to do certain things. It is the faculty of determination, a determination after the mind has considered the facts and reached a conclusion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heart,</span><span class="font4"> as here used, does not mean the organ which propels the blood through the arteries; but the word is used symbolically, and denotes that faculty of the man which induces action. It is the seat of motive. It is the seat of affection and love. Man is said to have a bad heart when it appears that his motive in acting is wicked. He is said to have a good heart when it appears that his motive in acting is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No creature can exist without an organism. A human body of flesh is the organism of man, and the breath of life in that organism animates the organism and causes all the faculties to function. Hence we read that God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into him the breath of lives, and man became a living soul. (Gen. 2:7) Every man </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font4"> a soul. It has been the fraudulent teachings of Satan and his agencies that have induced men to believe that man </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">possesses</span><span class="font4"> a soul, and that the soul is the immortal part of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wisdom, justice, love and power arc attributes of the creature. They are faculties of the mind. In these attributes man is like unto God. Every man is a character. No man possesses a character, even as he does not possess a soul. When a man is good or bad it is said of him that he is a good character or that he is a bad character, because he is either a good or a bad man. A perfect character is a person possessing all of these four attributes in equal and exact balance. God is The perfect Character. The primary attributes are equally balanced in him, and they always work in exact harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God created man with the purpose of giving him everlasting life on earth. Wisdom provided that man must first be put to the test before being granted the prize of life everlasting. The test was: Would man be true and faithful to God? Adam was put to the test and failed. Justice demanded that Adam forfeit his life because he had violated the law of God, and justice must see to it that the law is enforced. Jian could not be excused for his wilful wrongdoing without violating justice. Justice alone operating would destroy man for ever. Love, which is the perfect expression of unselfishness, provided for man’s redemption and deliverance and that all the obedient ones, under the test, would be given the blessings of restitution to human perfection and be granted life everlasting. Thus it is seen that wisdom, justice and love were acting in exact harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Power carries into operation the purpose of God. The four attributes of Jehovah therefore work always in harmony and always in equal and exact balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It must be conceded that the all-wise Creator had a purpose from the beginning. Satan being the one who for selfish reasons induced man to violate God’s law, it would follow that he would oppose every step in the execution of the Lord’s purpose which looks to the redemption and deliverance of man. Furthermore it would follow that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">every suggested plan for man’s deliverance, which is contrary to God’s purpose, is from the Devil;</span><span class="font4"> and is advanced by him for the very purpose of turning away the minds of men from the arrangement of God. God’s purpose is right and reasonable. None other is reasonable. It is therefore easily seen that all the remedies suggested by men are not only unreasonable but have proceeded from the Devil, and are injected into the minds of men in order to keep men from considering God’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There would be no necessity for more than one line of action for man’s blessing. It is conceded that there are thousands of man-made plans held before the people. The reasonable mind must at once conclude that none of these are right, because they are unreasonable and because they are all different; and when he sees the real reason for them he sees that they are all suggested by the wicked one. This should cause the intelligent man to seek more carefully to understand the divine purpose and its out workings. Therefore God invites man to come and reason with him. He says: If you do this it matters not how wicked you have been, I will show you the right way; and if you follow my way I will make you as white as the bleached wool and as pure as the snow from heaven.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark10"></a>THE WORKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE creation of the earth did not happen by chance, nor did it come into existence by the operation of blind force, as self-constituted savants and wise men claim. Its formation was by the will of God and it was created directly under his supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So it is written in Hebrews 3:4, “ Every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also, in Isaiah 42: 5 we read, “God, Jehovah, . . . created the heavens, and stretched them out; he . . . spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Future ages may witness the other planets of greater size giving glory to the Creator beyond anything that is now revealed to us, but man cannot now conceive of any of them ever being more highly honored than the earth. When man comes to appreciate this fact he will more fully appreciate how he has been favored by the great Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That which lifts the earth into a position of importance beyond anything possible with the other planets is the fact that upon the earth has been staged the great drama of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It must also be kept in mind that the Logos, the glorious Son of God and the active agent in the creation of all things, at the will of Jehovah left the courts of heaven and came to earth, and while on the earth was subjected to the severest testings; that he here proved the perfect man’s proper relationship to Jehovah; that he suffered an ignominious death and was raised out of death and then exalted to the highest place in heaven next to Jehovah. All this was done in order that God, in his due time, might establish his will amongst his creatures on earth and in heaven, and all to the everlasting good of the peoples of earth and to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning this it is written: ‘‘Being found in fashion as a man, he [Jesus] humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” This quotation is from Philippians 2:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The exaltation of Jesus was higher than all others of God’s creation, and aside from Jehovah none other will ever be so high. That exaltation was not be-</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark12"></a>OF JEHOVAH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">cause of something Jesus had developed within himself. It was not because he had developed a character separate and distinct from himself; nor was it because of what he had done before he came to earth; but it was because of his fidelity, as a man while on the earth, to Jehovah in the faithful performance of his covenant and his duties and obligations laid upon him by his Father. The earth was made the place where Jesus gained his victory through faith. The earth was honored above all the other planets by reason of what Jesus did upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because God used the earth and man for his eternal purposes, and because his beloved Son Jesus when a man upon the earth proved his fidelity to God before men and angels, the conclusion must be that the earth is the most favored, and will remain the most favored, in the planetary creation of God and will always be dear to the heart of the Creator. The man who traverses the earth now does not have a proper appreciation of the favors that have been bestowed upon him at the hands of the Creator, but in God’s due time he will come to a proper appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God made the earth suitable for animal life that is found upon it. The animal creation eats and drinks and enjoys existence and in due time perishes. Alan is more than merely an animal to exist and propagate his species. His mind gives him capacity to search out the great truths in God’s arrangement and this lifts him far above the other animal creation. His mind needs food and his gracious Creator has abundantly provided all his ways with food for both body and mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some men now have a sufficient knowledge of things to prove that man may make an endless search into the wonders of the earth, and other great creative works of Jehovah which are related thereto, and that making this search his worshipful adoration toward the Creator will increase. In these marvelous works of creation God displays his wisdom, justice, love and power. When man begins to learn thereof he is filled with wonder, admiration, awe and reverence for the Master Workman. He needs to come to this attitude before he begins to learn wisdom. In fact wisdom is the application of knowledge according to the divine standard; therefore man must know of God and know God, at least to a degree, before he can become in any measure wise. With profound respect and reverence mingled with fear and trembling, man pursues his way in seeking knowledge of the Almighty. As his appreciation of this knowledge of God increases, his affection for Jehovah increases. Then he delights to know more of God’s works, and his pleasure leads him to seek them out. One of the holy prophets of Jehovah, musing upon the wonders of creation, exclaimed: “The works of Jehovah are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.” This is written in Psalm 111: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible is God’s Word expressed and revealed to his creature, man. The general thought amongst men is that the Bible is a confused mass of thoughts expressed. This erroneous conception is due to men who have misrepresented God and his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible shows the clear statement of God’s purposes concerning the earth, and man once made its prince. Its opening chapters show that it was meant for man’s instruction. It discloses that God purposed that man should be the prince of the earth as long as man would remain in full harmony with his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible’s first mention of man and of God’s purposes concerning man is expressed in these words of Genesis 1: 26-28:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Scriptural statement, properly understood, means that God made man to be his representative on the earth. God endowed the perfect man with the faculties of reason and justice, wisdom, love and power, and gave him the freedom to use his will. In these respects man was made in the image and likeness of his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah created the earth, and therefore it is his by right of creation. He set in operation his laws, established by him to produce results, and results followed in harmony with his will. The heavens and the earth were made by the expressed will of God. “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made,” as we read in Psalm 33:6,9, “and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Alienated from God and disregarding his law, men speak of the earth and treat it as though it were man’s by right of discovery and occupancy. The laws adopted by the common consent of nations recognize the right to the possession of the land by reason of supposed discovery. When men braved the storms of the Atlantic and landed upon American shores they planted the flag of their respective rulers upon the land and claimed it. A man flies over the region of the North Pole and drops the flag of his nation and in the name of his sovereign king claims title thereto. But in truth and in fact no right to possession exists by discovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The class of ultraselfish, known as the rulers, mark out a portion of the earth, claim it as their own, and use it as lords; while other men till the soil as their serfs and are permitted to exercise no right of claim or possession thereof. There is no such inherent right in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The earth belongs to Jehovah God, to be used by man in harmony with God’s will. Whether man could have adopted a better system of occupancy and use than has been, is not here the question. The real question here for determination is, To whom does the earth belong?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The answer must be, It belongs to Jehovah, and in his own good time man shall occupy it in harmony with Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God is just. It therefore follows that one class will not occupy the land by the exercise of injustice toward another class. In Psalm 47:2, 4 it is written: “For the Lord most high is terrible [all-powerful] ; he is a great King over all the earth. He shall choose our inheritance for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That man has no right to use the earth contrary to God’s way is shown by the declaration of his law: “The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine.” (Lev. 25: 23) God has permitted man to take his own course. But when the proper relationship between himself and God is understood and appreciated by man, the earth will be used for the common good of all mankind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark14"></a>THE ORGANIZATION OF JEHOVAH GOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">N ANSWER to a question concerning his second presence, the end of the world, and his coming to his own, Jesus Christ the great Prophet said: “And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven.” (Matt. 24:30) It was after the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, the year of the event which the Bible describes as the Lord’s coming to his temple, that the great sign of the Son of man did appear in heaven in fulfilment of the Lord’s prophecy just quoted. What, then, is that sign?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah caused his great Prophet, to whom he gave a revelation, to have these prophetic words written in Revelation, chapter twelve, verse one: “And there appeared a great wonder [or, sign, according to the marginal reading of the Bible] in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” It is quite certain that the sign mentioned in this prophecy is the same one that is mentioned by Jesus in his prophecy. In both instances the word ‘sign’ is translated from the same Greek root word. It is also certain that the sign could not be seen and appreciated until the Lord came to his temple and the temple was opened for the Lord’s service. A sign means an indication or proof given for the purpose of establishing a fact. The “great wonder” or sign must of necessity be something in fulfilment of prophecy. Since this sign is to be seen in heaven, it follows that it would be discernible by those who have a vision of heavenly things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With Jehovah everything is in order and proceeds orderly. With him there is no confusion. First Corinthians, chapter fourteen, verse thirty-three, says: “For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.” He knew the end from the beginning, and therefore everything with him must work exactly in order and come to pass at his fixed time. In his first prophecy, delivered in the garden of Eden, he spoke of the woman that would produce the “seed” or offspring which would be used to accomplish his purposes. That prophecy could not refer to Eve and her child, but must have reference to something prophetically represented by the woman and her seed. The Scriptures furnish the proof that “the seed” is “The Christ”, God’s Anointed or Messiah. (Gal. 3:16, 27-29) In connection with the “seed” it is written in Galatians, chapter four, verse twenty-six, that the city of “Jerusalem which is above ... is the mother of us all”, meaning all who are of that “seed”. The earthly city of Jerusalem must therefore refer to God’s organization above. Therefore in the Scriptures a woman is used to represent symbolically God’s organization. We must know that God has an organization, because everything is done in order, and nothing could be done in order without an organization. Therefore the irresistible conclusion is that the woman mentioned in the afore-quoted prophecy of Revelation, chapter twelve, verse one, is God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It may well be said that God has always had an organization; but since the earth is for man, and the Scriptures were written for men on earth who are being prepared for God’s organization, the prophecy above must have reference to the organization that would have a direct effect upon men. It must have reference to an organization prepared specially for men, and more particularly for those men who are to be taken into God’s temple class and made a part of God’s organization. The great Prophet Jesus uttered a prophecy to his disciples and said: “In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”—John 14:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The word “mansion” used in this scripture means a place to stay or abide, a residence. In God’s organization there are many positions or places to stay or abide. But Jesus’ declaration was that he was going to prepare a place in that organization for his faithful followers on earth. He meant that he would prepare a place in God’s organization for them, that they might be there with him; and that in due time he would return and receive them to himself, that they might abide with him. Since the ascension of Jesus into heaven that which has been the great desire and hope of the true followers of Christ Jesus has been his coming and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was prophesying concerning his coming and his kingdom when he speke of the “sign” of the Son of man appearing in heaven. The time must come, therefore, when his true followers would have the proof and understanding of his kingdom, when it is brought forth, and when it would begin to operate. When a woman gives birth to a child, it means that the child is brought forth that it may begin its actions of life. It is therefore confidently stated that the sign appearing in heaven is the proof or the indication to the temple class that God’s kingdom has begun. (Ps. 2: 6) And this some of the faithful would see before being taken to the Lord in heavenly glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The woman, in the prophecy uttered in Revelation, chapter twelve, verse one, appears “clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet”. God made that sun and the light it gives. (Ps. 74:16) In one of God’s prophecies uttered concerning the kingdom, namely, Psalm eighty-nine, verse thirty-six, it is written: “His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.” Psalm eighty-four, verse eleven, says: “For the Lord God is a sun and shield.” In Psalm one hundred and four, verse two, it is written that Jehovah covers himself with light as with a garment. As to the symbolism of the moon under the woman’s feet, it must be said that the law of God is his expressed will, and those who love him are guided thereby and walk in the right way. Psalm eighty-nine, verse thirty-seven, says: “It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven.” The nineteenth Psalm, verse seven, says: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” And the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm, verse one hundred and five, says: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The woman clothed with the light of the sun and walking in the right way represents God’s organization illuminated by him and moving according to his will. Upon the head of the woman was seen a crown of twelve stars, which prophetically says: ‘The Head of God’s organization is Christ Jesus, the great Prophet, Priest and King and chief executive officer of Jehovah, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth.’ (Matt. 28:18) The ‘twelve stars in the crown’ shows the twelve divisions of the glorious organization of Jehovah, represented in the twelve apostles. (Rev. 7:5-8) It is after the temple is opened in heaven that those of the temple class yet on earth, by reason of the “lightnings” of Jehovah, the flashes of his truth, see this great wonder or sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Psalm one hundred and ten, verse one, when Jesus ascended into heaven he was directed by his Father to “sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool”. Jesus must have been eager to get into action and oust the enemy and vindicate his Father’s name. The time would come, as shown by the prophet, when Jesus would do that very thing. That would mark the beginning or bringing forth of the kingdom or government of the Lord. Therefore the prophecy of Revelation, chapter twelve, verse two, describes God’s organization as ‘a woman with child ready for the birth and pained [or anxious] to be delivered’. The time must come when Jesus Christ would take his power and begin the operation of his kingdom, because God had caused his prophet David to prophesy, in the one hundred and tenth Psalm, verse two, that he would send forth Jesus to rule amongst his enemies. That would mark the fulfilment of Psalm two, verse six, which refers to the time when God would set his King upon his throne. That would represent the birth or bringing forth or beginning of the kingdom, which kingdom is to rule the world. That would be clearly in fulfilment of the prophecy of the fifth verse of chapter twelve of Revelation, which says: “And she [God’s organization] brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “man child” is God’s government which shall rule and dominate all the nations and peoples of the earth and which will not permit any opposition. Thus is shown God’s kingdom which will rule according to his will. That is the kingdom and rule for which Jesus taught his disciples to pray: “Thy kingdom ‘come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matt. 6:10) Therefore the prophecy shows God’s organization represented by the woman clothed with the sun, and giving birth to or bringing forth the kingdom to rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in nineteen hundred and fourteen (A.D.) that Jesus’ period of waiting came to an end. (Heb. 10:13) That marked the time of the end of Satan’s rule, and from that time forward he would not be permitted to go on without hindrance. It was then that the World War began, which marked the fulfilment of the prophecy concerning the Lord’s second presence and the end of the world, as recorded in Matthew’s gospel, chapter twenty-four (7-9). But the true followers of Christ Jesus could not and did not see that “sign in heaven” until after the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, because it was in nineteen hundred and eighteen that the Lord fulfilled the prophecy that he would come to his temple, and he began to give to the temple class greater light upon God’s Word. (Rev. 11:19) By that time the Lord had ‘prepared a place’ for his body members, as he had prophesied; and now he had come to assign them a place in God’s organization and to give them greater light that they might ascertain the will of God concerning them. The birth of the nation or government, the beginning of the Lord’s kingdom by placing the Lord upon his throne, and his coming to his temple, is the key-truth to the unlocking of much of the prophecy which God reveals to his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark16"></a>FROM AFIELD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“FOR CONSIDERATION”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following question is submitted, as much for consideration as for answer, as I presume if the point involved is sound it will be dealt with by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In substance, the apostle says that the holy spirit made the elders overseers of the flock of God. The Lord himself having taken oversight of Zion now, is there justification for the service of elders any longer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expressed differently, was it not the purpose of the Lord to limit the jurisdiction of the elders to the time of the absence from the earth of the Lord Jesus, commencing with his ascension, and the giving of the holy spirit, and ending with the withdrawal of the holy spirit as a guide or teacher, and the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An extraneous evidence of this might lie in that there has been room for considerable criticism of the elders in recent years, particularly since 1922. Called to serve, many of them have been found to be a “thorn in the side” of the Society, the directors, the service organization, and the faithful workers. Their election, presumed to express the “will of the Lord” by the holy spirit, has frequently been found to result in opposition to the “mind of the Lord” as manifest through the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Would not the withdrawal of the holy spirit imply the end of church government from the “ranks up”, and the coming of the King to his temple imply church government from the “throne down”? And, if so, haven’t we a dual organization, governed from the “throne down” and from the “ranks up”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Answered in the affirmative, would it not be in the interests of the kingdom, and Scripturally correct, to dispense with elders and deacons altogether, and substitute teachers in the same manner as are the directors appointed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With warmest Christian love, by His grace, I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Charles Morrell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ontario.</span></p>
