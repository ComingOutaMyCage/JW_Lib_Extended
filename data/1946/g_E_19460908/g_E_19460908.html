<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>ATOM BOMBING AT BIKINI</span></h1>
<p><span class="font12">&quot; OMBS AWAY!&quot; Those were the words thatt were broadcast to the world a few seconds after </span><span class="font11">9 </span><span class="font12">a.ni. on </span><span class="font9">Julv </span><span class="font11">l. </span><span class="font12">Tho::;e were the words uttered </span><span class="font9">from. </span><span class="font12">a B-20 bomber flying some 30,000 feet above the peaceful Bikini atoll located in the </span><span class="font13">P</span><span class="font12">aci</span><span class="font11">f</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font12">c. Far below 42,000 people Jiad assembled to witness the explosion of the fourth atomic bomb as it &quot;burst among 73 naval vessels. &quot;The greatest single experiment in nU history,&quot; It wasas called. No other event, natural or man-made, has ever been so extensively measured, gauged, photographed and reported. No other event evor had such a ljuild-up by radio and press. It wasas </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">great show and the whole world was the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Shortly after Japan was defeated the idea of testing the po</span><span class="font9">w</span><span class="font12">er of the atom bomb on wars</span><span class="font11">hip</span><span class="font12">s was conceived. Elaborate preparations were made during the months thatt followed. By </span><span class="font11">January </span><span class="font12">of this </span><span class="font9">year </span><span class="font12">It wasas announced thatt </span><span class="font9">the </span><span class="font12">Bildni atoll was the stage for this joint army and navy display known as ''Operation Crossroads’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Congressional approval was obtained and May 15 was set as the date of the first test in whieh an atomic bomb would be exploded in the air over various types of warships. President Trti-man later put the first test off until </span><span class="font11">.T </span><span class="font12">uly </span><span class="font11">L </span><span class="font12">The second test was to be </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">shaJlow-water explosion, 18 to 30 feet under the surface. Sometime in 1947 a third test </span><span class="font11">will </span><span class="font12">be held with a deep-sea explosion. Tentatively, the date for this third test, named “Charlie Day&quot;7 is set for March 1, 1947.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">The &quot;guinea pjg&quot; fleet itself consisted of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">7:3</span><span class="font12"> ships totaling 335,000 tons. There were battleships, aircraft </span><span class="font9">c</span><span class="font12">arrie</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font12">s, cruisers, destroyers, submarines and transports; also German and Jap</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font12">nese ships. These were set out within a circle of 4,000 yards radius. In the midd</span><span class="font11">l</span><span class="font12">e was the 30-year-old be</span><span class="font11">t</span><span class="font12">tleship, Nevada, ancli painted an international orange color, it made a fine bull's-eye for the target. In addition to these sacrificial ships were over 100 others used for operational purposes. More thatn 130 airplanes, including helicopters, were also used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Amy equipment such as tanks, ammunition and poison gas was placed on board the ships. Also quartermaster supplies, like canned food, soft drinks, beer, candy bars and clothing were on deck. Cereal seeds, vegetables, Howers and cotton specimens were also included. Insects thati carry yellow fever, spotted fever and dengue were not overlooked. Yes, even hcdhugs were there! Additionnlly tlwre were th ousands of rats nn&lt;l nti(e, and hundreds of goats and pigs distributed on tile vessels as a grisly reminder thatt they were to die instead of men. 1n the waters of the lagoon itself some 400 different kinds of fish were intlucled in the observations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">By J nne 24 all the preliminary arrangements were set and a full-dress rehearsal was held, using a dimiiiiy bomb. The indications were thatt this was to he a $pectncular show, and so every publici ty agency was brought into play. A special ship, the Appalachian, was rigged up with a maze of intercommuni</span><span class="font11">cation </span><span class="font12">equipment. .More thatn 200 journalists and newspapermen were aboard. Representatives from the eleven member nations of the UN security counsel were invited. Space was reserved for 60 members of Congress. All together there were about 6,000 observers thatt were given special polaroid goggles so thatt they could actually look at the blast. And there were radio commentators too. Their job was to feed the four major networks of America as well as the foreign stations . AH together over 1,000 stations devoted </span><span class="font11">48 </span><span class="font12">minut</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font12">s of their time, at a cost of $200,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;Able Day,&quot; the name given July 1, arrived. At dawn the special B-29 called &quot;Dave's Dream&quot; raced down the runway on Kwajalein island and suecessfullv raised its lethatl lond into the air. Meanwhile, at Bikini, the men thatt had been keeping up the pressure </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font12">the boilers of the target ships were removed, but not before the last man on each ship had hoisted a special red and yellow flag indicating thatt none was left on board. The failure of any ship to show the special flag would have caused the test to come to a standstill. Outside the lagoon were 42,000 anxious men, watching and waiting. Admiral Blandy's sh ip, the Mount McKinley, wns 10 to 15 miles away. It wasas the closest. Beyond, in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">18-to-20-mile zone, were the reporters and visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As the listening world waited intently they could bear in the background the ticking of a metronome thatt had been placed before a microphone on the deck of the Nevada. Louder thatn the metronome was the cracking and static and off-stage voices intermingled with the shoutings of nervous radio commentators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The climax bad been reached. Dave's Dream had made two runs over the target to check its radar equipment and get its range. Now It wasas swinging into the third or live run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eyewitness Accounts</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On board the Appalachian miles away some watched the blaHt on the television screen. Others on deck looked through colored glasses as the violence of the </span><span class="font11">atom </span><span class="font12">was released on veteran battleships. For the majority, the show was a disappointment, since many of them had expected to get a thrill similar to thatt received if standing on </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">deck of a battleship when it fires a 16-ineh broadside in a hurricane. But nothing like thatt occurred. First, there was a flash, said by some to be disappointingly faint. Then, a few minutes later the sound like distant rolling thunder. Many :cientists, Congressmen and UN observers expressed their actual feelings and impressions from what they saw and heard, while others were carried away witl; their imagination and told the story as tf they were actually standing on the deck of the Nevada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One observer said thatt It wasas iio more spectacular thatn the colorful cloud thatt accompanies a forest fre in British Columbia. The RusRian representative, pointing at the elond, said: ••Not so much.&quot; A senator first looked at the sun through his colored glas::;es and then at the blast and said: &quot;My estimation of the flash is thati It wasas not as large or as bright as the sun.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In contrast with these statements are the reports of newspapermen like William L. Lawrence, of the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> who wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It wasas an awesome, spine-chilling spectacle, </span><span class="font12">a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">boiling, angry, super-volcano struggling toward the sky, belching enormous masses of iridescent flames and smoke and giant rings of a rainhow, </span><span class="font12">at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">times giving the appearance </span><span class="font12">of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> monster tugghig at the earth in an effort to </span><span class="font12">lift, it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and hurl it into space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The spectacular cloud, made up of billowv, creamy-white clouds streaked with </span><span class="font9">p</span><span class="font12">astel eolors of pnk and saffron and salmon, towered five miles into the stratosphere. At a height of two miles it swelled into a great knot; at three miles there was another knob; and at the top it spread out like a great mushroom or cauliflower head estimated to have been 12,000 feet in dliameter. Meteorologies explained thatt the pecuhar cap was due to the steam cloucVs suddenly freezing at 18,000 feet into ice </span><span class="font9">crystal. </span><span class="font12">First reports were thatt the </span><span class="font9">cimid </span><span class="font12">rose to 50,000 m^ 60,000 feet. Later, these figures were pared down to 24,000 to 35,000 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The high-speed earn eras (there were sixty of tlicm installed on steel towers five and ten miles from the explosion} gave a more accurate picture of what actually happened in thatt split-second when atom particles started splattering the lagoon of Biki </span><span class="font9">ni</span><span class="font12">. These cameras were operated by radio and some of them took 8,000 pictures per second with about onemillionth of a Recond exposure for each. These pictures showed thatt at first streamers of bright light shot out from the center. Then, an instant later, a huge ball of fire, more thatn n mile wide, seared and blaekencd the ships. </span><span class="font9">A </span><span class="font12">moment later this was replaced by a fog bank of steam, ca</span><span class="font13">u</span><span class="font12">sed when water is suddenly heaterl ahowe 3,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Tn the center an atomic tornado of extreme violence was generated which surged upward thousands of feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This caused the wind to rush </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font12">at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">speed of 500 to </span><span class="font11">l </span><span class="font12">,000 miles an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the </span><span class="font9">extremely </span><span class="font12">::;hort time thatt it took the bomb to </span><span class="font9">explode, </span><span class="font12">one-tenth of a millionth of a second, radiant energy was released thatt ltad at the &lt;'enter an estimated temperature of 100,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit, ten thousand times hotter thatn the surface of the S\n. In the first 5000th of the frst second some of this data was recorded. Also spectrographic measurements were captured. </span><span class="font9">A </span><span class="font12">short time later pilotless drone boats and p</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">l</span><span class="font12">anes were steered into the target area to take samples of the radioactive water and air. Thousands of pressure, velocity and temperature gaitges were used to record the effects or the blast. Geiger counters wen,. installed in all the planes and hoats to measure the radioactivity, Individual </span><span class="font9">'‘secur'd y </span><span class="font12">badges</span><span class="font9">&quot; </span><span class="font12">told i{ tlje personnel had </span><span class="font9">once  </span><span class="font12">subjected to overdoses of the deadly rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some of the Damage Done</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The blast slapped the water with such force thatt it momentarily depressed it like a saucer. Great damage was done, though not of such magnitude as predicted. Five ships were sunk; nine were heavily damaged; forty-five others suffered badly. The hlnst &quot;damaged more ships thatn have ever before been damaged by a single explosion&quot;, said the official report. Blandy ::;aid, though, thatt one should not he too hasty in drawing conclusions from these meager facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because few ships were sunk outright and the palm trees and Rteel towers on Bikini islancl three and a Italf miles away withstood tl</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font12">e blaRt, many people were prone to pass it off as a miserable failure. Granted tltat the bomb was not as great as the one dropped on Nagasaki, which was rated ns 15,000 t</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font12">mes thatt of a 500-pound bomb, yet one thing is certain, and thatt is, the atom bomb is still the most monstrous and polf'nt weapon of destruction so far exhibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In time of war the ships would have been crippled to the point of uselessness by losing their radar, radio and fire equipment. Yet more damaging thatn fire and blast pressure were the in</span><span class="font9">v</span><span class="font12">isible rays of radioactive substance, consisting of gamma rays and particles of neutrons, electrons and alpha particles. This form of radiation is equivalent to thatt of thousands of tons of radium. Bomb-burst radiation, milligram radium, is extremely fierce and lasts but a millionth of a second. but death may follow weeks later. Though at 18 miles distance on the Appalachian this radiation amounted only to thatt of one-twentieth of a second exposure under ordinary X-ray, which is harmless to hmnans, yet jf those creatures </span><span class="font13">of </span><span class="font12">flesh and blood who were disappointed at the show had been on board the ships in the target area there would have been a heavy loss of life. Many would have died from the blast within 3,000 yards of the center, and within 1,000 yards few would have survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Lingering radioactivity in the area was somewhat proportional to the distance from the burst. Forty-eight hours after the blast the beach of Bikini was safe for sunbathers. But some ships closer to the blast were still dangerous on July 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">First reports said thatt the bomb was dropped with very good accuracy and thatt ''it could not have been hettet'&quot;. But later It wasas shown thatt the bomb fell 1,500 to 2,000 feet west of the target ship and to its stern. This explains why the transport Gilliam was sunk '‘in a matte</span><span class="font11">r </span><span class="font12">of seconds&quot;', whereas the Nevada escaped. Though Bl8Jidy said thatt the bomb exploded ••at exactly the intended height”, others claimed thatt H did not go off at the intended height. It wasas supposed to have been the same type as thatt used at Nagasaki, thatt is, </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font12">Plutonium bomb instead of a Uranium 235 type as used at Hiroshima, yet It wasas &quot;somewhat less powerful” thatn the Nagasaki bomb. The fact th</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font12">t the cloud did not rise to 60,000 feet was proof of thatt. Nevertlie-less, It wasas terrible enough in its destructive force to set the Saratoga afire two miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No tidal wave was created, and the earth was not shaken as predicted. Magnetic and radioactive gauges stationed in such scattered places as Hudson Bay </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font12">Canada, Peru and Australia failed to respond, and tidal gauges and seismographs in California and Hawaii were not disturbed. This was because an atomic bomb is only oiie-thousandth as powerful as a moderate earthquake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What About the Animals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Only about ten pencent of the goats and pigs were killed outright. So the first corielusions were thatt radioactivity was not as bad as predicted. The second day goats were found munching hay on the forecastle deck of tlte hard-hit Pennsylvania. But mice under the gun turrets on the stern of the Nevada a few hundred feet from the center of the blast were all dead. This led Colonel Wan-en to the belief thatt ships cannot he built thick enough to protect their crews from the lethatl radiation of nearmiss atomic blasts. It wasas also learned thatt white mice flown through the cloud in drone planes after the blast turned brown. Reports showed thatt many of those found alive were sick and later died. Some of the animals were given a special hath to remove the radiation, hut two weeks after Able Dav it \vas reported from the animal sJilp, Burleson, thatt the survivals of the atomic blast were &quot;dying like flies&quot;. Blandy later denied this as an overstatement, and said mortality was at the ''expected rate&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Second Test at Bikini</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Precisely at 8:35 a.m., July 25, called &quot;Baker Day'', tl</span><span class="font11">i</span><span class="font12">e first underwater atomic bomb exploded beneath a fleet of 87 naval vessels of varions types. Thon-sands of mi</span><span class="font11">l</span><span class="font12">e s away the listening world heard by radio w!iat sounded like the continual roar of </span><span class="font11">a </span><span class="font12">pouncling surf, or more accurately descrihed as the amplified sound of esc</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font12">ping excess </span><span class="font11">steam from </span><span class="font12">a ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Once again a great ball of fire lighted the lagoon. Then thousands of tons of water gushed up skyward out of the bowels of the lagoon to </span><span class="font11">n </span><span class="font12">heigh</span><span class="font11">t </span><span class="font12">of </span><span class="font9">5,000 </span><span class="font12">feet. Intermingled with this water </span><span class="font10">w</span><span class="font12">as a gray-blue cloud of radioactive mist and steam. It </span><span class="font12">was peach-colored on the edges and continued to </span><span class="font11">rise to an altitude of two miles. hut </span><span class="font11">was </span><span class="font12">higger at the base thatji former atomic explosions, resembling a gigantic, </span><span class="font9">s</span><span class="font12">himmering </span><span class="font11">mushroom. </span><span class="font12">Estimated </span><span class="font11">to </span><span class="font12">have </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font11">diameter </span><span class="font12">at the base of 2.000 feet, it fogged out and obscured the television scre</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">ns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The wvawes thatt this explosion raised on the lagoon were </span><span class="font9">s</span><span class="font12">aid to he all the way from 2 to </span><span class="font11">10 </span><span class="font12">feet high. Mere ripp les they were compared with the predicted 100-foot </span><span class="font11">waves. </span><span class="font12">nevertheless, this explosi</span><span class="font11">o</span><span class="font12">n was no firecracker affair</span><span class="font11">. </span><span class="font12">Tt tossed giant battle-wagons around as if they were toys, and caused considerable damage. One obBf'rver said thatt the atom </span><span class="font12">bomb No. </span><span class="font13">5 </span><span class="font12">was </span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">qu</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font12">l to 50,000 tons of rNT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The next day early reports indicated ten slrips had been sunk, including a battleship and </span><span class="font11">an </span><span class="font12">aircraft carrier, while six others were badly damaged. No ship survived within a </span><span class="font11">radius of a </span><span class="font12">half a mile of the explosion. Double proof has thus been given to show th</span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font12">t the atomic bomb is a deadly weapon of destruction to both life and ship</span><span class="font11">s</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font12">whether it is </span><span class="font10">ex</span><span class="font12">ploded above or below the surface of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Why </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">These Tests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These atom-bomb tests were no</span><span class="font11">t </span><span class="font12">sponsored by </span><span class="font10">t</span><span class="font12">he UN organization, but were an unde</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font12">taking by the United States only. The pnrpose, Mcording to Admiral Blandy, was </span><span class="font11">primarly </span><span class="font9">to </span><span class="font11">determine </span><span class="font10">t</span><span class="font11">he effects </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font10">atomic bomb npon naval </span><span class="font11">vessels </span><span class="font10">to gain information of value to the national defense </span><span class="font12">. </span><span class="font11">. . Secondary purposes are </span><span class="font10">to afford training for Army Air </span><span class="font11">forces </span><span class="font10">personnel </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font11">attack with </span><span class="font10">the atomic bomb against ships and to determine the </span><span class="font11">effect </span><span class="font10">o£ the atomic bomb upon mJlitary </span><span class="font11">installations </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font11">equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It was &quot;to impro</span><span class="font11">v</span><span class="font12">e the defensive features of combatant ships&quot;', it was </span><span class="font11">&quot;</span><span class="font12">cle</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font12">r</span><span class="font10"></span><span class="font12">ly as a defensive measure”, said the brass-buttoned admirals. Afore is re</span><span class="font10"></span><span class="font12">vealed by these st</span><span class="font9">a.</span><span class="font12">tements </span><span class="font11">than </span><span class="font12">appears </span><span class="font11">on </span><span class="font12">the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To say that the </span><span class="font11">tests </span><span class="font12">were </span><span class="font11">&quot;scientific </span><span class="font12">experiments”, as </span><span class="font9">$o</span><span class="font12">me 8aid they </span><span class="font11">w</span><span class="font12">ere, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Is</span><span class="font12"> not altogether true. Th&lt;' scientists that gave the world </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font12">atom bomb did not approve of these tests, and said </span><span class="font11">that </span><span class="font12">nothing new was to be learned from such. The thousand scientists that took part in the test, it is said</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font12">did so &quot;with heavy hearts and without enthusiasm&quot;. The Federal American Scieuti;ts said that &quot;nothing of scien tific value and lit-tl? of t</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">chnical value to peacetime use of atomic energy'’ would be learned </span><span class="font11">from </span><span class="font12">the tests. The f'cientistR were not enthusiastic about these purely &quot;defensive&quot; tests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Joint Chiefs' Evaluation Board err</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">d when it said that these test</span><span class="font11">s </span><span class="font12">were to enable &quot;the </span><span class="font11">U</span><span class="font12">United States </span><span class="font11">to </span><span class="font12">ret</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font12">in its present position of scientific leadership''. Military leadership is </span><span class="font11">what </span><span class="font12">many believe they meant. Huge amounts of quartermaster supplies were placed </span><span class="font11">on </span><span class="font12">decks </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font12">yessels Just to &quot;see what happens''. No</span><span class="font11">t</span><span class="font12">h</span><span class="font11">-mg </span><span class="font12">was learned </span><span class="font11">ahout </span><span class="font12">the effect radiation had on the grea</span><span class="font11">t </span><span class="font12">stores of valuable material that was destroyed by fire or </span><span class="font11">went down with the </span><span class="font12">sunk ships. </span><span class="font11">Far </span><span class="font12">more scientific control, and heiice more valuable </span><span class="font11">information, </span><span class="font12">could have been obtained by subj</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">cting those materials to radiation in the l</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">b</span><span class="font12">oratory</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font12">and at a fraction of the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And speaking of expense, the navy said that the exp</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">riment would cost onlv about $100,000,000. But others placed the cost mo</span><span class="font11">r</span><span class="font12">e n</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font12">arly where it belonged, around a hall billion dollars. It depends </span><span class="font9">011 </span><span class="font12">the bookkeeping system used. According to the navy the ships were junk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Political Repercussions</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The mvaluation Board said that &quot;the test was well conceived and executed&quot;. And secretary of the navy, Forrestal denied that it was a threat of war to the other nations. However, others doubt the sincerity of these statements. In fact, an atomic bomb test at a time when peace conferences are in order touched off a nmnber of repercussions in different parts of the earth. Many observers see in it a theatrical exhibition before the world of the military strength of the .United States. They see in it, too, a political move on the chessboard of international diplomacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The French press poked fun at the great publicity that was given this event. If it was a purely military experiment, why aU the publicity! ls it customary for the iiavv to invite hundreds of newspaper reporters and radio announceTs and representatives of foreign governments to witness military experiments at its proving grounds? Not at all. A French scientist said: &quot;The ^American atomic bomb test in the Pacific is a miserable idea and a poor example to give the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Italian Socialists paper said: «The atomic bomb is on a level with the evil deeds of the Nazis and places conquerors and vanquished 011 the same plane.&quot; .Another Italian newspaper said that the test was the &quot;most startling, monstrous and at the same tin</span><span class="font11">m</span><span class="font12">e tragically grotesque e</span><span class="font9">x</span><span class="font12">p</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font12">riment</span><span class="font11">&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One British comment about the test comes from a member of Parliament. He was loudly cheered when he rose in the House of Conmmons and said: &quot;Wbv choose innocent animals when there are so many guilty men available?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Russian comment on the Bikini tests </span><span class="font11">jg </span><span class="font12">worthy of: note. ‘'(An aggressive gesture against all people of the world,&quot; said a Soviet newspnj)er. Another Russian writer commented about the fact that atomic energy for peaceful purposes is subordinated to military use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another commented on the fact thatt although the bomb failed to sink all the warships, it, nevertheJess, &quot;fundamentally undermined the belief in the seriousness of American talk about atomic disarmament&quot;. It is a means of &quot;black-mail that </span><span class="font9">can be </span><span class="font12">be used against those wlio do not agree with, or submit to&quot; the United States, is the foreign impression made. Even Russian scientists showed &quot;profound anxiety at the fact&quot; that atomic energy was being used by the United States, &lt;&lt;not foi’ the good of manland but to its detriment as an instrument for oppressing and enslaving other peoples.’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not only abroad, but here at home, many people were and are opposed to such &quot;experiments&quot;. Senator Huffman is quoted as saying that &quot;the United States cannot escape the accusation that it is acting in a most unsuitable and hypocritical manner&quot;. Scientists too have opposed holding such sword-rattling demonstrations at a time when there is supposed to be a peace in the making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">America stands at a gTeat vantage point in history because of her heritage, resources and skill, but she does not use these to inspire confidence in her ability to establish peace. .Mlaybe the explanation for this deplorable condition is given </span><span class="font11">by </span><span class="font12">Dean Gildersleeve. She said, not so long ago , ’’We have been [ailing because our lea</span><span class="font10">d</span><span class="font12">ers and representatives have lacked brains that see the goal and think straight. They have lacked wisdom, and they have lacked courage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Notwilhstanding this unfavorable comment following the first test on July 1, preparations with dress rehearsals went on apace for the next one held on .July 25. The admirals try to justify these •’experiments&quot; by saying that the data gathered will prevent another 'Tearl Harbor&quot;. But as far as developing </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font12">defense against the atomic bomb Dr. J. Hobert Oppenheimer, director of the atomic bomb laboratory at Los Alamos during the war, says: “There are no specific counter-measures for atomic liombs.&quot;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">AWA{E/</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">It is for this reason that men like Oppenheimer and Trey who developed the bomb now tear it more than anything else. They see in these bomb tests the gathering of data for use by the militarists, and not for peaceful scientific use. The scientists say they labored under an illusion in developing the bomb in the first place. As one of them put it; ''VVe thought the democracies would use it wisely to end the war to end all wars.&quot; But uo’v they see that the atom bomb of the futune will not have the killing power of </span><span class="font11">20,000 </span><span class="font12">tons of TNT, as the one used at Hiroshima, but rather, an atomic bomb of the future will he equal to one or two million tons of TNT. Furthermore, these bombs will be relativelv cheap when compared with other types of weapons. One estimate is tliat in the not-too-distant future an atom bomb will cost no more than $1,000,000. More than two billion was spent developing the first one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those who see beneath the surface and iltink in tetins of the third dimension find no peace of niliid or consolation in the fact that these atomic tests are promoted by the militarists. Those who hope and pray for peace find no guarantee that such military leaders will establish a lasting peace through their bomb research. No, not when tliey read concerning the war-crime.s trials in Japan that it was the militarists tliat set the stage and promoted the China incident that eventually embroiled half the world's population in a long and bloody conflict.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Atomic Age of Fear</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">Originally scientists were experimenting with atomic energy with the view </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font12">mind of using it for the benefit of man, but tliejr efforts were diverted into destructive channels. Instead of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a bomb test, why not spend a little in developing the peaceful possibilities </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font12">atomic energy? &quot;V1ty not use it to cure skin cancer on a large scale? There are also many other applications for atomic energy that are now known. Up to the time of the war over </span><span class="font11">400 </span><span class="font12">radioactive isotopes had been discovered. Why not develop their possibilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is true. a few days hefore the first Bikini bomb was released the government finally made available a small quantity of atomic by-products for medical purposes. _But in doing so they said : </span><span class="font11">&quot;It </span><span class="font12">probably will be impossible to meet all of the demands </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font12">the country until additional pile facilities are built specifically for radioactive isotope production.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All right, why not spend some of the money that was sunk in the Bikini lagoon </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font12">building such piles? No! say the militarists, such &quot;is not contemplated in the irmnediate future&quot;. Instead, they say that millions will now be spent in redesigning and improving naval vessels for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Instead of perverting this valuable source of energy, as bas been done in the mid-Pacific, why not use it for legitimate purposes? Why not, for example, heat a great city like New York next winter by atomic energy? It is claimed that the harnessing of the atom for the generation of power is already in the blueprint stage. Why, then, does the government not give such experimental work its full support and financial aid instead of giving it to some fish-killing, mouse-destroying, nation-frightening show of military might </span><span class="font11">f</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Does it not seem inconsistent for </span><span class="font11">a </span><span class="font12">nation to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on these admittedly military preparations for a third world war, and at the same time send its delegates to what is called a “United Nations&quot; peace conference </span><span class="font11">f </span><span class="font12">.And yet this is what is done, and both events are reported in the same newspuper. The United States finds herself in this ridiculous position because in reality slie does not have faith and confidence in the </span><span class="font11">UN </span><span class="font12">organi-zati.oji. She believes what Trygve Lie says: ''The immediate job of the United Nations is to forestall actual war between nations.&quot; In other words, it is admitted that s\ich factional organization can only delay war. If the United States7 without faith in the </span><span class="font11">UN </span><span class="font12">organization, busies herself perfecting machinery for the next war, how can she inspire other nations to have faith that the </span><span class="font11">('United </span><span class="font12">Nations&quot; will outlaw war?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Great fear has seized the rulers and the ruled. Tliey admit the atomic bomb offers no guarantee against war, with the exception of the Vatican, which says that the atom bomb is more important as an instrument of peace than as an </span><span class="font10">in</span><span class="font12">strument of war. Imagine! Neither does the announcement that a method is being worked on for detecting an experimental atomic bomb explosion anywhere in the world give any comfort or peace of mind. It is a case of &quot;'men's hearts failing tliem for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth&quot;.—Luke 21: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">- ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And so, driven by this fear, the nations prepare for war. Even while the preparations were going forward for the Bikini tests announcement was made that the United States ltad developed other terrible weapons besides the atomic bomb. Fear, too, was increased when it was disclosed that the Russians tried out an atomic bomb on December 18, 1945, that made obsolete the .American type. F’rom now on it is a race between these so-called “brotherly&quot; nations whose foreign ministers sit around the peace tables while their scientists build bigger and better bombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If an atomic explosion is the greatest manifestation of power that man can produce, and yet it is only one-thousandth as powerful as a moderate earthquake, tlien the nations that have forgotten God should surely tremble and fear, for shortly now Jehovah God, the Almighty and Infinite One, </span><span class="font11">will </span><span class="font12">shake this earth with such destnwtive violence that the atomic bomb tests of Bikini will pale into insignificance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">An analysis of the musical merits of the &quot;popular song&quot;, ragtime and jazz, plm a few observations on the vanity that often attends serious music</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font12">HE primary purpose of music is to bring praise to Jehovah God, as the Bible so abundantly testifies, and its secondary purpose is to delight and benefit man. It may wen be termed the language of the heart, the speech of our emotions. When filled with superlative joy, intense longing or keen grief, words seem inadequate, and the soul breaks forth into song, in music. A case in point is the Psalms, which were originally sung, and which run the whole gamut of human emotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not only is music the expression of the heart, Jut also food and even medicine for it. Man has a hunger for beautiful sounds just as he Ju1-s a hunger and thirst for food and drink, for heauty that is visual, and foi’ truth and knowledge. Music satisfies that hunger for beauty in sound. And music has been found to be good medicine for troubled spirits from tile time physicians prescribed it for King Saul down to our day. Edison, some thirty years ago, made many e</span><span class="font9">x</span><span class="font12">periments demonstrating the value of music in changing one's moods. It </span><span class="font11">has </span><span class="font12">been found that when sorrow depresses the heart, or bitterness, anger or resentment arises in the breast, the hearing of beautiful and cheerful music will help restore peace and calm. Because of this. good music is an aid to the Christian who seeks to have eontrol of his </span><span class="font9">m</span><span class="font12">ental disposition and to have his mind and heart filled with such things as are pure, honest and of good report. Such is particularly true of music written in praise of Jehovah God and about the joys of His service. But there are many different types of music, and not all have a good effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Popular Song</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">About a hundred years ago in this country such men as Stephen Foster wrote songs that appealed to the multitude and which became very popular<span class="font12">. Such were really <span class="font12">folk songs, and are still popular today because they Jiad both sincerity of thought and musical merit. However, about the same </span><span class="font11">time, </span><span class="font12">and more and more so as the years rolled by, another song was being composed, the •'popular song''. Its authors and composers were not men who .felt the mge to give their fellows something beautiful and had the gift to do soi but were such as had but one concern, that of making money; and this they would do by catching the popula</span><span class="font11">r </span><span class="font12">fancy with some-' thing seemingly new. For years they sentimentalized over the sorrows caused by the unfaithful lover, the drunkard father. the 'dead mother in the baggage car ahead', etc. Excessive weeping over the woes and wrongs of others brought a </span><span class="font9">cer</span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font13">i</span><span class="font12">n amount of emotional relief; the people enjoyed it, and so it was worked to the limit by these tune smiths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the country went to war the peddlers of this type of entertainment found it profitable to become patriotic, and so patriotism became the last refuge also of musical ( </span><span class="font11">1) </span><span class="font12">scoundrels. When prohibition came along they sang of the «alcoholic blues'' because someone had stolen their booze. Since then the popular songs have continued to deteriorate, until today they have reached an alltime low. the </span><span class="font10">p</span><span class="font12">opular song is puerile, childish: &quot;Shoofly Pie/' &quot;One-zy, Two-zy, I kiss You-zy</span><span class="font11">; </span><span class="font12">Two-zy, Three-zy, You kiss Me-y&quot; ad infinitum, ad nauseam. It is vulgar: “I'm nobody's mama now; Sunken hips and frizzled lips&quot;; it is blasphemous in its references to God and the Scriptures; it is filled with creature worship, idolizing &quot;heroes&quot; and  romance; and when it is not brazen in its appeal to the desires of the flesh, it does so by . means of the &quot;double entendre&quot;, using seemingly innocent words to convey evl thoughts. It is told of a leading young lady in a Broadway musical, who had recently come to the &quot;Great White Wav'' frorn Texas</span><span class="font12">, that she actually crie</span><span class="font11">d </span><span class="font12">when told the significance of the words she was singing. But slie evidently soon got over her grief, as she kept on singing the words. The popular song reflects the mind of this world, a world under the control of  the Devil and plunging liead-Jong toward destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Nor should it be thought strange that this is so. Today tJe writing of popular songs is a highly commercialized business, Big Business. Ability is so scarce that we often -find three or more listed as &quot;composers&quot; of an inane melody, while a like number claim credit for tlje lyrics; the former being as ignorant of tlte grammar of music as the latter are of the possibilities of the English language. One on the &quot;inside'' of tliat business opined t</span><span class="font11">h</span><span class="font12">at the reason that no hits were emanating from ‘Trn-pan alley&quot; these days was that its composers never go hungry, they being well paid regardless of whether or not they produce!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Tin-pan alley. That place is well named as oue writer not so long ago observed: &quot;Tin. the one metal that suits the dull reverberatiom; of the passing song. Pan, the one instrument to send out its flat repetitions, its tiny monotony. Alley, not eveu a street. It is a place of crassness of sentimentality and cynicism.&quot; No wonder they have to hire ''pluggers” and bribe artists to bring their wares before the public!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Ragtime</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">What is ragtime? and where did it originate? How the name got its start is anybody's guess? not much being known except that when playing music a certain way, they spoke of it as &quot;ragging&quot; it. One thing is certain, there was ragtime before it was called by that name. Ragtime i!:l generally acceded to be syncopation. And what is Syncopation 1 Well, it is a form of rhythm, and in music rhythm is the &quot;regular recurrence of strong and light accents&quot;. </span><span class="font11">Usually the stress falls on the first note of a bar of music, a secondary stress being given at the half-way murk, such as: One, and, Two, and; or One, two, Three, four. To get the effect of syncopation the stress is reversed, and we have: one, A-xn, two, And; or, one, Two, three, F'our. By means of tJjis novel use of rhythm, music has a spice, a piqnancy all of its owri. Composers of &quot;good&quot; or seiions music have kept this in mind mid therefore nse it very sparingly, it being found chiefly </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font12">musical nov</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font12">lti</span><span class="font9">e-</span><span class="font11">s</span><span class="font12">. Many ' of l;he advocates of ragtime point to this fact to argue that t</span><span class="font9">h</span><span class="font12">e</span><span class="font10">r</span><span class="font12">e is nothing wrong with ragtime. But in ragtime we do not have just the nse of syncopation, hut its abuse; it is syncopation ridden to death, he come, as it were, a disease. In ragtime the rhythm is the all-important factor, melody, harmony and musical ideas being slighted for its sake. The overdoing of this novel fo</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font12">m of rhythm has semething exciting about it, and its effect upon the liste</span><span class="font11">n</span><span class="font12">er is to make him reckless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To appreciate the difference between the use of syncopation by composers of serious music and of Ragtime one might </span><span class="font11">liken </span><span class="font12">it to the nse of alcoJjolie beverages. At dinner there mas' he a little Burgundy wine on the table- to go with the steak. This may add to the enjoyment of </span><span class="font11">tltH </span><span class="font12">meal and also aid the digestion </span><span class="font11">; </span><span class="font12">for is it not written: ''Wine maketli glad the liea.rt of man,&quot; and, &quot;Take a little wine for thy stomach’s sake''? In moderation it serves a good purpose, and its actual volume as compared with the meal as a whole is very small. That compares to the use of syncopation in serious music.</span></p>
<p>It, tin-pan alle</span><span class="font11">y </span><span class="font12">with its ragtime is comparable to the sa]oonkeeper who</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">keeps coaxing his customer on payday to have one glass after another of cheap whiskey, having an eye only on his own profits and not at all concerned about what happens to his customer's health and family. Or it may be likened to the reckless young set of today who imbibe a lot of liquor because it makes them feel &quot;good&quot;, irresponsible, and arouses their amorous impulses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This is easily appreciated when we remember that Ragtime (not just syncopation) &quot;harkens back to darkest Africa and is derived from tribal open-air exuberance&quot;. It was the music of savages, who, having no appreciation of melody&quot; not to say anything of harmony, knew music only as rhythm plus noise. It served to give expression to their primitive instincts as well as to arouse them, and was always associated with dances having either a religious (demonic) or sexual significance. </span><span class="font11">In </span><span class="font12">fact, in many of the pagan ceremonies the two go hand in hand, even as recorded in the Scriptures regarding Baal-peor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Those savages were highly skilled in their rhythms, some of the rhythms being so complicated that the white man could not imitate them. When kidnaped and sold as slaves to the cotton growers of the &quot;Old South”, they brought with them the beginnings of ragtime. Their skill in rhythm and sense of humor soon produced the Negro minstrel, that form of entertainment so widely imitated by the white man. It has been said that ragtime began with the Negro's restless feet, and that it is nothing more than </span><span class="font11">a </span><span class="font12">pepped-up version of the Negro spiritual. it has been said that in his spiritual be yearns after God but in ragtime he yearns after the Devil; his spiritual being for Sundays, bis ragtime for the other six days of the week</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When ragtime first took the country by storm, </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font12">prominent musical educator gave it a withering blast of invective, stating that it was, among other things, •&lt;the musical attitude toward life only</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">14</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">too familiar to us alL An attitude shallow, restless, av’id of excitement, incapable of sustained attention, skimming the surface of everything, finding nowhere satisfaction, realization and repose. It is a meaningless commotion without purpose, an epilepsy simulating controlled muscular action. It is the musical counterpart of the sterile cleverness we find in so nmch of our centemporary conversation:''</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Viewed from a strictly musical standpoint, our critic of ragtime is correct, hut in other respects his definition falls short. It is not without meaning and purpose save in so far as it is without a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font12"> meaning and purpose. This is supported by the testimony of welfare ageJi-cies who claim that ragtrne and jazz have caused as inauy young people to go wrong as has liquor. Yes, ragtime is of, by, and for those who are bored and discontented, of whose lives it eau be said, &quot;All is vanity.&quot; But the music-makers must not be made to bear full responsibility for ragtine. Remember that music is the gpeech of the emotions, and if this old world's bosom is filled with sentimentality and restlessness, the musicians merely express it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jazz and Its Vmriations</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;What is jazz 7 Is it an art, a disease, a manner, or a dance? Has it any musical value? After twelve yeai’s of playing jazz, I don't lmow.'' Bo, at one time, spoke the so-called &quot;king of jazz&quot;. Some insist that jazz is not music, but merely a form or manner or metlioil of playing music. riiere seems to be considerable argument in favor of this view, as any piece of music can he “jazzed up&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jazz being the natural development of ragtime, it is not surprising to find that it too got its Rtart with the African Negro transplanted to this country. While both New Orleans. La., and Memphis, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Tenn., </span><span class="font12">aTe mentioned as the birthplace of jazz, it seems that the latter has the better claim to this distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">WAKE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">History lias it that a political candidate used a band of Negro minstrels in his campaigning, whose reckless and noisy playing and emphasis on rhythm so struck the popular fancy that their can* clidato was elected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a rule, these colored musicians who pioneered in jazz coulcI nut read a note, hut played entirely by ear. Being naturally gifted improvisors (ana that such is a gift cannot he denied) they could not resh;t the temptation to fly off on a musical rampage. Theirs was an outpouring, savage and exulting, noisy </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font12">unashamed, and was just what a world with the jitters, such as was the case in days of World War I and shortly thereafter, wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">.Jazz may have first seen the light of day in Memphis, bnt its ‘blues” were, without a doubt, born in St. Louis. The hl'les are another ijistance of the abuse of a musical elfect, an&lt;l were also originated by our colored minstrels. In music we have the major and minor keys, the distinguishing featnue of the miuor being primarily the &quot;flatted'' third and sixth notes of the scale which tends to give it a &quot;minor'' or melancholy hue. In the blues the music is written in the major keys and is given a sad or wailing quality by repeatedly fiattiiig the major third, the strongest note in the scale. Thus we have a music that is neither minor nor major, but a mixture of both. The Negro's rn;e of this device can, doubtless. be laid to the fact tliat his 'lot was not a happy one'. However, he had his sense of Immor always with him, and in his blues we find both present. The popularity of the bluest no doubt, is due to the fact that the modern American likewise finds in it the expression ior his discontent and longing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As time went on jazz hecame mor e and Diore a science, shoJI we call it, for the public was ever wanting something new. Jihis is particularly shown in its use of color and rhythm. In jazz, rhytlun also gets the lion’s share of attention; and, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 8, 194U </span><span class="font12">while it is generally associated with rag* time, it has reacbed the point of development where it is possible to have jazz without the nse, or rather the abuse, of syncopation. How so? By the clever means of clashing t\vo definitely and regularly marred rhythms with each other. There is no limit to the possibilities of novelty and excitement by such interplay of contrasting rhythms, in comparison with which ragtime seems rather tmne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">True, composers of serious music also make use of this effect, as wlien </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">melody in waltz time is played with an accompaniment in common time, 3/4 nnd 4/4 time Leing played simultaneously. But here again tin-pan alley does un effect to death for the many who crave novelty and excitement. Such use of contrasting rhythms requires a great deal uf emphasis, and so we find that the rhythm section, with its banjos, bass fiddle (wbiclt is &quot;slapped&quot; instead of bowed), drums und the many traps, is the most important section in u jazz band. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In their quest, for novelty and variety the jazzmen have not overlooked the possibilities of color, and most of their works abound in ''loud'' and clashing hues, although there are also some of a more subclued nature. In jazz the brasses reign supreme and undisputed, Jiving up to the colloquial meaning of their name. In the symphony orchestra the brasses are used very sparingly, particularly the trumpets and the trombones; and even in a baud, the brasses aTe employed as if' ever aware that there are s\ich instruments as the woodwinds (flutes, clarinets, etc.), which must also be heard. But in jazz lie brasses blare to their hearths; eontent, and for the sake of novelty mutes are used; producing an endless variety of effects, nasal, whining, etc., all in keeping with the jazz spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, the most distinctive instrument of jazz is the &quot;moaning&quot;' saxophone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This instrument ltaH a color so different from </span><span class="font11">that </span><span class="font12">of other orchestra instruments that it ever calls attenlion to ih;eJf. It may he termed a brash and rugged in-dividnalist wlio refuses to nwrge hi::; personality with others for the sake of harmony; which explains wlty repeated efforts to include it in symphony orchestras have been unsuccessful. J3ecause of this, in most jazz bands they replace the strings and are harmonized to furnh:lt the background for the trumpets, which effect. can be and at times is pleasingly and skillfully used. As a solo instrument 1t also has some merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The quest fur variety in color bas brought forth &quot;hot') and “sweet&quot; jazz. Hot jazz is played by a raucns aggregation of instrumentalists and is t</span><span class="font11">h</span><span class="font12">e symbol of </span><span class="font9">u </span><span class="font12">world •with the jitters which says, 'Let ns eat, drink, and be jazzy, for tomorrow we die/ Some men drown their cares with </span><span class="font11">drink; </span><span class="font12">hot jazz helps others to do it with noise. On tho other hand, &quot;sweet&quot; jazz is subtle and languoj:ons, the language of sentimentality, of insinuation ami double meaning. &quot;\¥hen the public got tired of one extreme, tin-pan alley turned to the opposite extreme, and today it gives out bot.l</span><span class="font11">i</span><span class="font12">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Recent variations of jazz are &quot;swing'', ‘‘boogie woogie,&quot; &quot;jive,&quot; the &quot;jam session&quot; of tlte “jitterbugs&quot;, etc. But regardless of the variation, they all fall into the same category of lawless expression so far as tlje rules of musical composition are concerned. As someone ltas well said, jazz is a ‘•tripartite agreement [of melody, barmoiiy and </span><span class="font11">rhythm] </span><span class="font12">to disagree, taking over in the one place [music] that was to he forever free from noh;e and confusion&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font12">spirit of jazz, none other than Paul 'Viiteman, the &quot;king of jazz&quot;, wrote this indictment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">'•I thlnl{ </span><span class="font12">it is- a mistake to call jazz cheerful. </span><span class="font11">The </span><span class="font12">optimism of Jazz is the optimism of the pessimist who says, 'Let us eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.' This cheerfulness of despair is deep in America . , . Behind the rush of achievement is a restlessness of dis-satif’action, a vague nostalgia and yeanling for something indefinable, beyond our grasp. . . . that </span><span class="font11">is </span><span class="font12">the </span><span class="font11">tiling </span><span class="font12">that is expressed by that wail</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font12">that longing, that pain, behind all </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font12">surface clamor and rhythm and energy of jazz . . . It is the expression of the soul of America.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But, is there nothing good about the popular song, ragtime and jazz? Have our jazzmen and tlieir associates produced nothing but chaff, </span><span class="font11">filth </span><span class="font12">and poison. It </span><span class="font12">would hardly be fair to put it that <span class="font12">sti'ong, yet, compared with the quantity that they produce, that which has itwrit is so smaJl as to be negligible. Occasional!y there is a rneJody, a musical work, a popular production that gives evidence of ti'ue beaut}*. Such a notable exception is Gershwin’s "Rhapsody in Blue". </span><span class="font12">Another composer’ who may also be singled out is the late Jerome Kern. some of whose melodies have been likened to folk music.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Vanity in Serious Music</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">In justice to all it must l)e admitted that there is much vanity associated with serious music. Not all serious and so-called &quot;good music&quot; iR of worth and merit, deserving to live. Those old boys, known as the &quot;greai masters&quot;, tlu:-y also had to make a Jiving; and so they also Jtad to furnish musical compositions on demand, even tltougJt they were without new musical idea$ at the time. And if jazz is aRsociated with one form of religion that incites passion and liits wide of the mark of the purpose of music, se-rious music is verv much contaminated with another form of religion, creature worship, and lands wide of the mark in other resjiects. Most or its devotees bow at the shrines of ‘‘great’’ composers, “great&quot; artists, both vocal and instrumental, and “great&quot; conductors, give them reverence and speak of them with bated breath, at the same time affecting a <span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">WAKE ! </span><span class="font12">a disdain for the &quot;ignorant and unlearned'' multitude who do </span><span class="font11">lint join </span><span class="font12">tlwm hi their &quot;worship”.

<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>the Watchtower School's Seventh Class</span></h1>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font18">N </span><span class="font12">A wintry day in February, 1946, the seventh class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead started on its way of five and a half months of intensive ministerial training for foreign missionary service. Fifty-eight men and 47 women comprised the class of 105 fulltime ministers that had been called in for special training. the passing months saw winter crowded out by spring, and that delightful season in turn give way to summer. the fleeting term of joy and Jtard work had sped by and now the students stood on the threshold or July 28, graduation day. Hu: elapsing time had piled up in the minds of the students many memories as well as much Imowl-edge, memories of days spent at Gilead tltat will endure as a </span><span class="font11">rich </span><span class="font12">treasure. Once the instructors of the seventh class were humorously charged with committing something like that described at Revelation 9 : 5, which reads: “And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months.'<sup>3</sup> but in earnest tone others spoke of theii- school days at Gilead ns a foretaste of harmonious living in </span><span class="font11">.J</span><span class="font12">ehovah's new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On Sunday, July 28, before an audience of 1,100 friends, relatives and guests, occurred one of the most pleasant graduation exercises ever conducted at the Watchtower School of Gilead. Let the event be briefly told in the words of one of the graduating students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now the eventful day has come. Graduation day! Many relatives and frienili have come from all parts of the IJuited States and even some from foreign luntls to witness the graduation of the seventh class of Gilead. 1'he day dawned with a clear sky and preparations </span><span class="font11">were </span><span class="font10">made to hold the exercises outside. At 9 </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span class="font11">00 </span><span class="font10">a.m. the sun beamed down </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">the assembled body in front of the main building. After a song and a few opening words by President Knorr of the Watchtower Society, the Society's Branch servant from England, A. P. Hughes, spoke </span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font10">o </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font10">with heart-warming words of enoouragement to continue steadfast in Jehovah's service. then the Fnrm servant, J. </span><span class="font11">0. </span><span class="font10">Booth, and the four school instructors, each in tmn, gave </span><span class="font11">us </span><span class="font10">sincere admonition to push ahead with greater zeal in the work of </span><span class="font11">helping </span><span class="font10">the nations to be glad with Jehovah's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the next houi’ the Watchtower School president, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">N. H. </span><span class="font10">Knorr, addressed the assembled students and frieuds on the subject •'Whose Witnesses Are Yo</span><span class="font12">n </span><span class="font11">y» lu </span><span class="font10">this discourse we were enabled to first look at the religious viewpoint of being a witness of Christ Jesus, and theu to look at the theocratic viewpoint of .being </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font10">wituess of Jehovah. By logical reasoning on ^ny scriptures pertaiulng thereto, we were able to see clearly that we should follow the example set before us by Christ Jesus and be witnesses for Jeho^ vah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the speaker then addressed the students impromptu for a few minutes, explaining the work that is ahead. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hh</span><span class="font10"> pointed out that a diploma did not alter one's position in the Lord's sigM. It was what each one had in his heart. that counted. Those students who had reached a certain standard set by the school wore then presented dij,lomas, together with a class pjeture aud their report cards. Also the Lord provided a grac:ions gift to aid the students to get to their next assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For all these things we give thanks, aud it was aptly expressed in a resolution presented by one of hc graduating students. This resolution set </span><span class="font11">.forlh </span><span class="font10">our determination to continue faithful in whatsoever territory we are sent. It was seconded and imanimously adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of the 103 ::;tudents who graduated, 93 did so with sufficient merit to receive a diploma. but ljy the Lord's gracH all of the 103 graduates </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font12">the seventh class will conduct themselves meritoriously in their assigned fields for gospel-preaching. the picture of this class appeal’s on the facing page.</span></p>

Rom</span><span class="font11">e 8,000,000 </span><span class="font12">pou</span><span class="font11">n</span><span class="font12">d</span><span class="font9">s </span><span class="font12">of eels. </span><span class="font12">valued at </span><span class="font11">$250,000, are annually taken out of the streams from Maine to Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After more years of study Dr. Schmidt found that the honeymoon resort of all these eels, of Europe and America, was in the deep, not too chilly waters lying between Bermuda and the West Indjes. There on the ocean's floor Jmncheds of feet beneath the surface of the water a mother eel lays between 5,000,000 aml 10,000,000 eggs. A hen would have heart failure to even think of it. An unfutJwm-able mystery lies in the bottom of that Sargasso sea, for, though it is known that this is where they spawn, yet during all the years of search investigators liave never been able to fmc! a single mother or father eel in those waters, dead or alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After an unknown period of incubation these eggs hatch out into tiny, leaflike, transparent larvae, which reach a length of approximately two inclies by the end of the first year. They feed on microscopic organisms. Gradually these larvae wriggle themselves toward shore, so tJiat, by the time they are ready to undergo their change from the flat, leaf-like larvae stage into the long, pipe-like eel shape, they are in the tidal waters and coastal estnai’ies into which the fresh-water streams flow. Elvers is what they are called after their change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The European eels are related to the American type, yet they are a separate and distinct species. The eels from that continent have more backbone than the American variety. They average from 111 to 118 vertebrae; American eels, only 104 to 110. Though these two distinct species breed in the same general locality, they never cross. Another (difference between the European and American eels is the fact that it takes the European eels three years to change into elvers, whereas the fast American eels take only one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now the greatest mystery of the eel's whole life cycle is found in this larvae stage. It is observed that the European </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">22</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">and .American larvae overlap each other in the Sargasso sea, and in their early life they live together in the same waters. But what instinct makes the European larvae travel toward Europe and the American species in the opposite direction is something that cannot be explained. </span><span class="font11">If </span><span class="font12">the American larvae set out for a European tour they would change into elvers in mid-ocean, and that would be suicide. Behold, then, the infinite wisdom and majesty of the Creator even in these small details!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is amazing, too, to observe that when these larvae reach the coastal waters and turn into elvers at the end of their first or third year, us the case may be, the males proceed no farther than the coastline, but remain in the briny water to play among themselves as they grow to maturity. But the females start up the fresh-water streams to find new homes in the mud and under the rocks in the lakes and ponds and rivers where their mothers once lived. Some people even claim that daughter eels return to the very spot where their mothers lived, there to begin eating where she left off two to four years before. But who teaches them to go around the dams or over mountains to reach an upper lake, say, in the Swiss Alps? That is one of the many secrets of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If, now, this full you would catch a silvery eel and restrain it in captivity until its urge for matrimony is past it would turn back into its common, unattractive greenish-brown color. Becoming sterile it would lose all desire to return to the sea of its nativity and would be content to remain in its fresh-water home until it grew large and sleek and fat and </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font12">a ripe old age. Such is the life of the fresh-water eel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Besides these species of eels there are many others that inhabit the unknown regions of the seven seas. There are at least seventeen families, which are divided and subdivided into hundreds of species, each having a distint individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">.AWAKE/ </span><span class="font12">ity, each having mysterious movements of its own. Some tliat inhabit the coral reefs of the tropics are no larger than a thread. The Conger eel found off the coast of New England is from four to eight feet long and weighs from </span><span class="font11">50 </span><span class="font12">to 100 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then, there is the famous electric eel found in the jungle rivers of Brazil. The phenomenon of this eel is most mysterious and shocking. It has two pairs .of storage batteries beneath its skin that contain about 240 cells capable of generating high-voltage current; sufficient to </span><span class="font11">kill </span><span class="font12">large-size animals, even knocking down a man. Records have shown that one of these mysterious powerhouses no longer than eight inches can discharge 110 volts, and </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font12">three-foot electric eel can discharge 500 volts. Little is known as to how the::; current is generated or discharged. It has a secret patent aH its own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is little wonder that people in the olden days, knowing nothing of the mysterious movements of the eels, thought they originated from soaking horsehair in water. Even today an understanding of what governs the migratory habits of these creatures cannot be grasped, hut is itself '•as slippery as an eel&quot;.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Did the Ancients Use Electricity?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font12">HE archeologists were puzzled, some ten years ago, when Willelm Konig of the Iraq Museum dug np a queer vessel in the ruins of KJmjut Rabu'a, southeast of Bagdad. Made of pottery, the jar was about six inches high and contained a copper cylinder, closed at the bottom, on the inside of which was an iron rod. Asphalt around the top showed that the iron and copper were insulated from each other. rhereafter, in the excavations at Tel'Omar four jars, three of which had similar cylinders, were discovered. Later twelve more were unearthed in the same place, aud in another place still otbers were  found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the years before World War II German scientists had come to the conclusion tilat these jars were an ancient type of galvanic battery similar to that devised by the Italian physicist Volta, </span><span class="font9">u </span><span class="font12">century and a half ago. The T</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font9">chno</span><span class="font12">l</span><span class="font11">ogy </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Review</span><span class="font12"> made these observations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though the matter must remain pure speculation, the circumstantial evidence is rather complete. </span><span class="font9">Dr. </span><span class="font10">Konig was authority </span><span class="font9">fol’ </span><span class="font10">the statement that there still exists in model'll Bagdad </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font10">ill'imitive art of electroplating with zinc, the origin of which is obscure. Numerous examples of andent Parthian bowls and vases of copper, plated with gold and silver, arc also to be found. No one has ever before discovered how the plating was done. Since one metal can most easily he deposited upon another, especially a dissimilar one, by elec</span><span class="font12">tric c</span><span class="font10">u</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">rr</span><span class="font10">e</span><span class="font11">n</span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font10">it is a fair assumption that the ancients not only know of e</span><span class="font12">l</span><span class="font10">ec</span><span class="font11">t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font10">icity but understood how to make it and use it. The ques</span><span class="font12"></span><span class="font10">tion of a suitable electrolyte would not have been difficult. Both acids and alkalis were probably then known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">After Willard F. M.. Gray, of General Electric, heard about these discoveries and tieir possible use as batteries, he decided to build an exact replica and see if it would work. He used an electrolytic solution of copper sulphate and found that the cell worked perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a consequence it will he necessary for the encyclopedias to revise their discussion of electricity, wherein they claim that the physician to Queen Elizabeth, WSHam Gilbert of the sixteenth century, is deserving of &quot;the title of founder of the electrical science''. The ancients also were smart enough to use electricity.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Martin Luther on the Soul Question</span></h1>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font18">HE </span><span class="font12">large majority of Americans, whether they attend church on Sunday or not, are Protestants,. but great numbers of them have forgotten the most important of the doctrines that Luther discovered when he turned to an lionest study of the Bible. It is the doctrine that the soul is not inherently im-morta I and will attain everlasting life only 011 condition of faith, and the obedience which is of faith. The idea that the sonl, which the </span><span class="font12">man himself, is immortal and cannot die, regardless of whether one is good or bad, is a heathen conception en </span><span class="font10">t</span><span class="font11">i</span><span class="font10">r</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font12">ly foreign </span><span class="font11">to </span><span class="font12">the Scriptures, and was introduced into the </span><span class="font11">&quot;Christian </span><span class="font12">religion” some hundreds of years after the death of the apostles. Luther quickly realized the truth on this subject and so wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The dead are insensible. They lie, not reckoning days or years, but when awakened will seem to </span><span class="font11">have </span><span class="font10">slept seareely a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They </span><span class="font11">[</span><span class="font10">the dead] lie </span><span class="font11">h1 </span><span class="font10">a profound rest and sleep, to the day of judgment, not knowing where they are. . . </span><span class="font11">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">All </span><span class="font10">that is said concerning the immortality of the soul is nothing- but an invention of antichrist to make his pot boil </span><span class="font4">. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">permit </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font10">pope to make articles of fa.ith for himself and his faithful, such as </span><span class="font4">. • . </span><span class="font10">the soul is the substantial form of the human body, the pope is the emperor of the world and king of heaven and God upon earth, the soul is immortal. with all those monstrous opinions to he £oimd in the Roman dunghill. ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Blackburn, writing concerning Luther's stand in this matter, said plandy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Luther espoused the doctrine of the sleep of the soul upon a Scriptural foundation; a</span><span class="font12">u</span><span class="font10">d then he made use of it as a confutation of purgatory a.ud saint-worship, and continued in that belief to the last moment of his life. Luther was clearly and indisputably on the side of those who maintain the sleep of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Cardinal Due Perren says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Luther denied the immortality of the soul, whence he drew an argument against praying to saints, showing that the saints hear not our prayers . . . Luther reckons this among the impieties of the Roman Chureh, that she believes in the immortality of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Luther came to this conclusion on an incontroversible basis, that of the Bible itself, which says, cJearly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The living know that they shnll die: but the dead know not any thing.—Eeelesiastes 9 : 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shiill give thee thanks? —Psalm 6 : 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The souJ that sinneth, it shall die.—Ezekiel 18: 4, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What man is he that liveth, and shall not see denth </span><span class="font11">¥ </span><span class="font10">shall he deliver his </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font10"> f</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">x</span><span class="font10">o</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">m </span><span class="font10">the hand of the grave ?—Psalm 89: 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Jcad praise not the </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord,</span><span class="font10"> neither any that go down into silence.—Psalm 115: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge. nor wisdom, in </span><span class="font11">the grave, </span><span class="font10">whither thou goest.—Eecl. 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TJien there are the numerous texts whicli speak of the dead as asleep, which show that Lutlter was right in this matter, and the Papacy quite wrong. 'fo cite ouly a few:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">David slept </span><span class="font11">with </span><span class="font10">his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.—1 Kings 2: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And Solomon slept </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">w</span><span class="font10">i</span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font11">h </span><span class="font10">his fathers, and was buried </span><span class="font12">. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. . —1 </span><span class="font10">Kings 11 : 43.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Andi so throughout the Scriptures, the dead are shown to be as.leep, awaiting the resurrection in God's due time. And Luther knew it.</span></p>

This was different and distinct from the lifeforce or the spirit of </span><span class="font11">all fl</span><span class="font12">esh which remained in the dumb animal after the power of speech by God's spirit left it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Shortly afterward Balaam's prophecy was an example of whe</span><span class="font11">r</span><span class="font12">e God's spirit </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">irresistibly</span><span class="font11"> prevaiJcd over what an un</span><span class="font12">fait</span><span class="font10">h</span><span class="font12">ful prophet wanted to say ngainst Gods people and turned </span><span class="font11">an </span><span class="font12">intended curse into a bl essing. .Although he was bribed to make a try at cursing Jeho</span><span class="font9">v</span><span class="font12">ah’s nation of Israel, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Another case of where the spirit of inspiration came upon the enemies of God’s favored people in order to defeat the pmpose or the wicked! is that of King Saul. When the whereabouts of the outlawed David were reported to Saul he sent three successive bands of messengers to capture David, the giant-killer. But in the case of eaeh hand,&quot; •when they came and &quot;saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.&quot; Then King Saul went lijmself. •'And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the sphit of God was upon him also, and lie went ou, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down iiakecl all that dav and all that niglit. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prop </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">}j</span><span class="font12"> e ts ?&quot;—</span><span class="font11">1 </span><span class="font12">Samuel </span><span class="font11">] 9: 18-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The reason why that came about was this: When Jehovah God rejected King Saul for his stubborn disobedience, a man after God's own heart was sought for. That man proved to he the shepherd David, and God sent the prophet Samuel to give David the sign of bis commission from God to be the future king. •'Then Samuel took the horn of oil, ann anointed him in the midst of his brethren : and the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward.&quot; Simultaneously, ''the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lmm troubled him.&quot; (1 Samuel </span><span class="font11">16: 13,14) </span><span class="font12">Certandy the removal of God's spirit from Saul left only room for a contrary spirit to control him. God sent an evil spirit upon Saul indirectly, in that he gave limi no encouragement ana His dealings with the anointed David stirred up in Saul </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font12">spirit of jealousy, bitterness, despondency, and fear for his kingship aml royal line. Hence God was not responsible for Saul's wicked attempts to kill David. As for David he was a changed mmi from the day of the coming of God's spirit upoii him after his anointing. (1 Samuel lO: 1, 6) </span><span class="font11">It </span><span class="font12">was with that divine spirit upon liim that he went out single-banded to talw up the giant Goliath's challenge and defiance of Jehovah. It was by the spii’it of Jehovah God tlmt David succeeded in making the lumbering giant bite the dust. &quot;The battle is </span><span class="font11">.Jehovah's,&quot; </span><span class="font12">David shouted out, as </span><span class="font11">he </span><span class="font12">moved into combat with Goliath: </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">—1 </span><span class="font12">Samuel 17: </span><span class="font11">40-54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There were other manifestations even earlier than this of where Almighty God's spirit or active force worked for the enemy's defeat. At the close of seven years' oppression by the heathen Midi-anites and their allies, Jehovah God raised up a man of faith and devotion, named Gideon, to act as judge and deliverer of his nation of Israel. The record is that God's spirit fairly clothed him or enveloped him to move him into action against the enemy. &quot;The spirit of the Lord came upon [clothed] Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer [the house of Gideon's father] was gathered after him&quot;' The utter rout of the Midian-ite invaders resulted closely after that. (Judges </span><span class="font11">6:34, margin) </span><span class="font12">A like expression is used concerning the fighter Amasai who led a faithful band to tlte hideout of David in the wilderness. When David asked if they came peaceably, &quot;then the spirit came upon </span><span class="font11">r </span><span class="font12">clothed] Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine a:re we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace he unto tliee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpctli thee.&quot; </span><span class="font11">( </span><span class="font12">1 ClH'onieles 12: 18) The like clothing or envelopment of a person with God's spirit is recorded concerning Zechariah the priest, at 2 Chronicles 24: 20, marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font12">ehovah's spirit of inspiration was upon fu.ithful prophets of old to sound warning to those who became God's enemies by breaking their covenant with </span><span class="font11">him. </span><span class="font12">As to this Nehemiah said: &quot;Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in tliy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands/' (Nehemiah 9: </span><span class="font11">30) </span><span class="font12">Of this same fact Zechariah says: &quot;Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent </span><span class="font11">in </span><span class="font12">his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a grpat wrath from the </span><span class="font11">LORD </span><span class="font12">of hosts.” (Zechariah 7: 12) The spirit of inspiration came upou Daniel to interpret the dream of Babylon's emperor, Nebuchadnezzar, and also the handwriting on the wall of Nebuchadnezzar's grandson Belshazzar's palace. Hence those heathen monarchs spoke of Daniel as one ''in whom is the spirit of the holy gods&quot;. (Daniel 4: 8, </span><span class="font11">9,. 18; </span><span class="font13">5:</span><span class="font11">11, </span><span class="font12">12, 14) Today the handwriting has appeared upon the wall of antityp-</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SO&quot;\ S</span><span class="font12"> SOME time ago the Federal Trade Commission made an an investigation of ''over the -A-SSLO counter'' medicines containing bromides. These included such products as Bromo-Seltzer, Capsealine, Stanback, and headache powders such as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">''</span><span class="font12">B.C.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font12">, as well as nostrums that are widely sold for the cure of nervous pains and &quot;hangovers&quot;. The government's purpose was to force manufacturers and advertisers to properly warn the unsuspecting public of the dangers and habitforming properties of these products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many medical authorities and specialists were called in to testify before the commission, but the public press said very little if anything about the matter. And little wonder, since newspapers and magazines receive a large revenue from the manufacturers of these products. However, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">JndiLstrial Leader</span><span class="font12"> of Winston-Salem, N.C., published some of the very enlightening information brought out at this FTC hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Excessive use of bromides will cause what is known as ''bromide intoxication&quot;, producing severe mental derangement. Mental symptoms of this are sluggishness to think, inability to concentrate, failure of memory, irritability and depression. Physical symptoms are skin rash, staggering and trembling. and a slurring of the speech. Most bromides also contain acetanilid, another habit-forjdner, which </span><span class="font11">if </span><span class="font12">nsed in excessive amounts will break down the blood and result in anemia. If its use is carded far enough heart failure results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">D1-. Max Levin, a psychiatrist and au-tho rity on the subject who had had a distin</span><span class="font10">g</span><span class="font12">uished career in medical colleges and hospitals for the insane, testified before, the commission. At the time he was serving as a major in the Army Medical Corps, and as a typical example of the Imbiit-forming effects of bromide addiction, he cited the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A </span><span class="font10">woman takes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">bromide </span><span class="font12">to </span><span class="font10">relieve insomnia</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font10">nervousness or anxiety. She notices </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">certain relief. She doe</span><span class="font11">s </span><span class="font10">not know it </span><span class="font11">ss p</span><span class="font10">oiso</span><span class="font12">n</span><span class="font11">. </span><span class="font10">She goes ahead and takes more </span><span class="font11">and </span><span class="font10">more bromides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Too much bromide makes he</span><span class="font12">r </span><span class="font10">more irri.-tablE)—unable </span><span class="font9">to </span><span class="font10">con</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">c</span><span class="font10">e</span><span class="font12">n</span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ra</span><span class="font10">te</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font10">She takes more bromide to relieve thethe symptoms, a</span><span class="font12">n</span><span class="font10">d so on in a &quot;vicious cycle&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bromide produces an intoxication </span><span class="font12">which</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font10">in </span><span class="font11">turn, </span><span class="font10">misleads the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">v</span><span class="font10">ic</span><span class="font12">t</span><span class="font10">im into taking more bromide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are thousands of victims in the insane asylums as a direct result of misusing bromides. Dr. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font12">ohn T. Cuttino, after testing 1,947 mental patients, found that 6.0 percent of the men had used bromides excessively; while the figure for women was more than twice as many. a staggering 14 percent. The average for the 1,900 cases ran around 10 percent. Insanity brought on by the extended use of bromides is similar to that produced by the excessive use of alcohol, sleeping tablets of the </span><span class="font11">&quot;barbital” </span><span class="font12">type, and various narcotics derived from opium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Now, then, what was the outcome of this revealing investigation </span><span class="font11">1 </span><span class="font12">.Although the Federal Trade Commission was fully convinced of the death-causing power of these products, yet it was helpless to put an end to the evil practices. Neither the FTC nor any other government agent can stop the sale of these dangerous compounds, nor are they able to force the manufacturers to put adequate warnings on the labels for the protection of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Summing up its article, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">]‘iulustrial Leader</span><span class="font12"> explains how ruthless and vicious commercialism of this old world is and what little regard they have for the Jives and health </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font12">the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The bromide business is </span><span class="font11">h</span><span class="font10">is busines</span><span class="font11">s</span><span class="font10">, run</span><span class="font11"></span><span class="font10">ning into many millions of dollars a year, and the F.T.C. has a hard fight. on its hands. The manufacturers appa</span><span class="font12">r</span><span class="font10">ently do not care how many people are crippled, driven nsane or killed by their products, as long as the profits roll in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Daily </span><span class="font10">newspapers are sn)riug nothing about these hearings. The bromide manufacturers are big advertisers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Therefore, educate the people. Replace the oratory of smooth-tongued radio announcers who advocate in honeyed words the taking of hromide at the the first sign of </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font12">headache” with some tougJii straight-forward talk about the bitter facts of bromides. line results will be that the sale of such products will go down. And with their going down will also go down the nnrubeT of those committed to insane asylums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As it is now, the only warning given is? •'Caution—Use only as directed. </span><span class="font11">If </span><span class="font12">pains persist </span><span class="font11">see </span><span class="font12">your doctor.&quot; Better would it be if they said, &quot;If pains persist sec your undertaker.&quot;</span></p>
