<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In Brief</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Boy and His Mother</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The boy was a North Carolina boy, and his mother, the wife of a well-to-do merchant, is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The boy was in the navy; he was located down at Key West, Fla., and, writing home to his mother, he said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are only 29 Navy men here, so we eat, sleep and live, in general, you might say, with the Army. Our commanding officer here is a swell guy, and since they need another signal man here, and since I am top man here in the school, he is trying to get me stationed here permanently. It’s a good setup: good duty, good chow, good gang to live with, etc. But I want some sea duty. Now shore duty is ten times better than any sea duty one could possibly get, and no one knows that better than myself, yet I still want to go to sea, and I think maybe I’ll be there very soon. All my old buddies that were down here when I came down have long since been shipped out, and you know how I feel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All joking aside, the more people I see, the more of life in general that I come to know, the more 1 am convinced that the things in which you believe, and your conception of the Bible, is 100-percent correct. It appears to me to be the only solution. And if I’ve said it before, I’ll repeat it now: you are the most honest, upright, intelligent (to mention a few of your many virtues) person I have ever known or expect to know. When I try to compare the “cream of the crop” of the people I know with you, the difference is so, great that I am convinced that you must certainly be among the few people on the face of the earth today who are actually in the favor of the Almighty. This may not seem like me, to be writing such as this, but it is my sincere conviction and I feel that I should tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The boy was drowned. At his funeral, conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses, five clergymen, two of them D.D.’s, were in the audience, listening attentively. ’</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font8">“And in His name shall the nations hope.”—Matthew 12:21, A.*9. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XXVII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y., Wednesday, January 2, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 686</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Faithful Martyrs in Concentration Camps</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font7">AITH is a virtue seldom found today in men and women. After passing through two global wars the people in general are without faith either in God or in their fellow man. This is because faith is not found in a fox-hole or stirred up in a concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There must first be a foundation for faith. Pointing to the proper basis for faith Christ Jesus said, “Have faith in God.” (Mark 11:22) The apostle then shows why this is necessary when he says, “without faith it is impossible to please him.” (Hebrews 11: 6) If one puts his faith on this sure foundation nothing will then be able to destroy it, not even ten years of terrible torture in a Catholic concentration camp. Such heat of ' affliction will only fuse one’s faith into the hardness of a diamond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Faith, fidelity and integrity are virtuous qualities possessed by martyrs. The literal meaning of the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">martyr </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">witness,</span><span class="font7"> and designates those who “bear witness” or “testimony” to their faith and belief in God. Such do so not by words and deeds only but also by their willingness to suffer persecution and torture, and even death, at the hands of religious zealots rather than break integrity. The faith of martyrs is imbedded in Jehovah their God and His Word, and nothing can uproot it. Such ones are therefore known as Jehovah’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first of these faithful witnesses was the martyr Abel, son of Adam. After him Enoch, the seventh from Adam, walked with God in faithfulness. Noah W’as a preacher of righteousness amid a wicked generation. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Joseph and Moses, were al] men of faith. And after their day there were men of faith like Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and all the prophets. Neither should we overlook those devoted women of old who so faithfully served as Jehovah’s witnesses: Sarah, Rahab, Deborah, Naomi, Ruth, and Esther, and many others. All of these “through </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">faith</span><span class="font7"> subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. . . . and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; . . . and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world-was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">faith,</span><span class="font7"> received not the promise”.—Hebrews 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus was killed because He spoke the truth in faith, and hence was called “The Faithful and True Witimss”. His apostles likewise proved their faith and devotion under suffering and finally sealed their testimony with their blood. Martyr Stephen is another outstanding example of the early Christians who refused to renounce their faith in Jehovah God. He was taken out and stoned to death by a pack of human wolves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Centuries then passed lay. Yet when Hitler came to power in 1933 and started his Catholic-Action steam roller this •,same class of faithful and true Chris-ttians were the first obstacles he ran into. &quot;With the arrogance of Satan the Devil Hitler boastfully declared that he considered these Christians as “quacks” and said that he would crush them beneath the weight of his “new order” of Church and State. This was the beginning of one of the most barbaric persecutions of Christians recorded in history. Men, women and children became the prey of the Gestapo ■wolf-packs. They were hunted out, tracked down and rounded up like wild animals and brought before . Nazi tribunals to stand trial for their life. One who was given such a mock trial before a kangaroo court wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As I came before the Courtroom of the 2nd Senate, the verdict was just being pronounced upon my forerunner. You can see how this grind-machine works: I enter, the Senate (Tribunal) seat themselves, then comes a brief summary of the offense, threatened punishment, and then—someone spoke out of my mouth, a testimony [in my behalf], that these gentlemen could only say: “You are an industrious man and of good reputation everywhere ; won’t you be sensible, or do you stand by your decision? Ours is only the best advice, etc.” The Senate withdrew for a little while, then in view of the fact that I maintained my objection, the death sentence was decreed. I listened, and then after I had spoken the words, <sup>(&lt;</sup>Be thou faithful unto death,” and a few other words of our Lord, it was all qver. A good half-hour—that’s how things go here. But never mind that now. For I have such peace, such tranquillity, that you can’t possibly imagine!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After such a farce as this, which reminds one of the mock trial given Jesus, these faithful witnesses were either executed or thrown into a concentration camp to bleed, suffer and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These martyrs of the twentieth-century Inquisition were known by various names, such as “Bible Students”, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bibel-forscher</span><span class="font7"> meaning literally “Bible Searchers”. Properly they were called “Jehovah’s witnesses” (Jehova’s Zeugen), because they were martyrs for Jehovah’s name’s sake. Over 6,000 of these witnesses were in prison camps at one time. Hundreds of them were executed by beheading, shooting or gassing. Hundreds of others died under the most fiendish tortures. And still hundreds of others died of starvation. And all of this because of their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Parting Words of Executed Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But did all this brutal and cruel treatment 'crack’ these witnesses? Did their integrity bend under the Inquisition’s pressure? Their own words ring back with an emphatic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No!</span><span class="font7"> Quotations from a few of the letters written by those who were later executed ■will show their unbreakable faith and integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you trust implicitly in God then you will always feel and see His sustaining power. And then you can, even with your heart breaking, you can smile! When the under officer from the Court called for me each time, and I smiled, he would say quite astonished: “Man, here they play with your life, and yet the fellow can laugh about it!” My beloved brotheri if your turn should come, then trust wholly <sup>: </sup>in Jehovah. Put your mind at rest, and don’t . be terrified before these brutes. Be always clean and polite, the latter when it seems almost too hard, and again, trust in God and be His faithful witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My dear Hildegard, I must endure until my hour has come also. I will not look back, so that I cannot see anything that would draw me from my resolve. “No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God,” said the Lord. And you too, my dear Hilde, look not behind, but think of Lot’s wife. I have a radiant goal before my eyes, and in order to reach this I will count my life as dross, and place myself in those, Hands, and commend my spirit into His keep</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing. I shall fight for the honour of Jehovah and the glory of His name. I will fight for Him with the courage and boldness of a roaring lion. Yes, I shall fall as. the oak in the storm. Sometimes I experience an overwhelming happiness, a tremendous joy in my breast knowing that my deliverance is near. The hour has come when the Almighty calls His people to himself, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and what can be more glorious than ■ to live and to die for His name's sake?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now, my dearest ones, there is no turning back I<sup>!</sup> There are still two hours left, but the die is cast! All the hardness and the pain have been overcome. But all through Him, who made me strong, Jesus Christ. And now, God bless you. Be strong, for I am not lost, but I can say with Paul, “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept -the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faith:</span><span class="font5"> henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.” Therefore, “Onward, press on!” to the honor of Jehovah and Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Parents,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This evening I was told that my sentence will be executed tomorrow morning early. From the beginning I have placed my hope entirely in Jehovah and Christ Jesus. And truly, whatever my experiences have been I can say throughout it has always been for the best. I rejoice that I have overcome to victory, to eternal life, though not of my own strength, but through the great mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah and our Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' Jesus Christ be praised for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- No faltering, no turning back, no compromise ; rather it was faithfulness even unto death. And it was such testimony multiplied many times over that made the world take note of the fact that God had witnesses in the earth, even in demonized Naziland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Swiss clergyman, Th, Brupbacher, observing this faithfulness of Christians in Germany said, “Here stands and suf-, fers an unheeded company in the front lines . , . who were the first to bear the brunt of the raving Nazi demons, * and who dared to resist in accordance with their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">faith:</span><span class="font7"> They suffer and bleed as ‘Jehovah's witnesses’ ...” Also the Swiss newspaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Oeffentlicher Dienst,</span><span class="font7"> in Zurich, said, “Crime, crying, to heaven . . . </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">one of the most</span><span class="font7"> terrible accusations that have been raised against the demonized rulers of the Third Reich ... If the European statesmen and party leaders had but had- a particle of the courage of Jehovah’s witnesses, the world would have been saved the atrocious crimes of the demons of our time ...” (Both citations from the 1946 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses,</span><span class="font7"> page 138)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not all these modern martyrs, however, received a quick execution. Thousands lingered and suffered untold agony on the very brink of death for eight or ten years in the vile prison camps. The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Mirror </span><span class="font7">(magazine section, February 9,1941), in an article on the concentration camps, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At present, many political prisoners are ■ from the ranks of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bibelforscher</span><span class="font5"> (literally, Bible Searchers, actually Jehovah’s witnesses). There are few Communists, but very many plain citizens who could not embrace the new ideals and so became punishable . . . After release [from a local prison], any prisoner may, if the authorities so desire, be sent to a concentration camp for an indefinite period of “preventive custody”. Every Bibel-forscher </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font5"> be so transferred, women as well as men. No Bibelforscher may </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ever</span><span class="font5"> attain freedom. Communists, except party officials, may possibly be released after some years of proved “conversion”. Bibelforscher, never!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Never, until Jehovah himself would bring them out; for the Nazis were determined that all of these Witnesses were to be exterminated from the earth. However, deliverance did come in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why Christians Were Tortured</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But why were these Christians, whose only crime was their faithful worship of God, subjected to all this terrible suffering? It was for the same reason that faithful men and women of ancient times were martyred. The purpose was to force them to break their covenant of faithfulness that they had made with God, If they would but renounce their faith, if they would but forsake their belief,. if they would but </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font7"> a statement that they were no longer Jehovah’s witnesses, then they could secure their freedom, But, oh, what faithfulness! They turned their back on the Satanic offer and chose to suffer the tortures of a long-drawn-out death rather than to compromise. Men and women of fidelity and integrity, a tower of strength in a desolate land of human despair. Truly, a people for His name, Jehovah’s witnesses !</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sign or Else—/</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most conclusive proofs that these faithful Christians did not really endanger the state is the fact that all they had to do to gain their freedom was to sign a statement to the effect that they would no longer worship Jehovah and be His witnesses. There seemed to be no limit to which the Nazis would go to secure these signatures. First persuasion was employed; then flattery was used; and finally the Nazis inflicted the most diabolical tortures, especially upon women, in an effort to break their integrity with God. The same tactics were employed as in the Catholic Inquisition for securing a “confession” from innocent Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A soldier boy on duty in Germany wrote to his mother in the United States, “One of the Germans, who had spent a year in jail for political reasons, told me that all Jehovah’s witnesses who were in jail over here had to do to get released was to sign a statement that they would </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Heil</span><span class="font7"> Hitler’ and be 'good Germans’; but he said none of them ever signed the statements.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following excerpts are from the many letters received and show the unbreakable determination of Jehovah’s witnesses in refusing to sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many other prisoners had also to work, but not under the same pressure as Jehovah’s witnesses, as the authorities wanted to compel us to sign. But they had no success. They always tried to find some way to give us extra punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No visitors were permitted in the camp, but if anyone came who wanted to persuade us to sign, they were allowed to see us. In this way I was visited by my sister and my brotherin-law. Without avail they tried to persuade me to take the pen in my hand. Angry and without a word of farewell they went away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At first I used to keep clean the offices of the political department of the Gestapo. Here I was often asked regarding signing. I only laughed at them and tofd them that I was no traitor. They asked me: “How long will you stay in the camp, then?” I answered: “Until our great God Jehovah gives me my freedom.” One of them said: “Yes, up the chimney!” (cremation). I told him that even' this could not frighten us, for our Father in heaven is able to give us new life, but that He would require our blood of them in the day of His wrath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After some time I met an Adjutant Wulka and gave him and his wife many testimonies. They shared all their good food with me, and often made suggestions regarding signing. When I again explained that I could not become a traitor, they said: “We wish we had such a strong faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year ago in February a commission was here from Berlin. At that time we were told it was the last opportunity to give our signatures, otherwise we would not remain alive Very long. But all the rhetorical resources of Satan’s representatives failed in front of the inflexibility and unwavering steadfastness of the children of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In June this commission was here again, and again we had to give an account of our hope and unflinching determination, and again those sisters stood before these men as representatives of The Theocracy. Fearlessly and boldly, they explained to the committee the two organizations, and that there could never be an agreement between them. At the close of the meeting one of these men said to the other: &quot;Think of this: years in prison, years in camp, and yet this spirit and this deportment !” Now they have ceased asking for our signatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On one occasion a sister heard the leaders talking about us. They said: “The Bible Students do any kind of work, but one work they will not do. They will not take up the pen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During this time Himmler visited the camp. He caused some of the sisters to be brought from the cells and wanted' to persuade them to sign. They refused. Full of fury and rage he said: “We shall see who will hold out the longest, you or we I” In the cells we could always hear when punishment by whipping was being meted out. It was terrible, the beating and the shouting and then, unconscious and covered with blood, the beaten ones were brought back to the cells. Each of us thought, ‘When will it be my turn ?’ And all of us decided that we would even go through with this rather than sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1944 all the sisters had to report to the political department for examination. They were told: “This is the last opportunity to be given you to sign. -If you do not do so you will all be shot.” We knew that they had already shot some of the brothers because they refused to sign, in order to frighten the others. Boldly and frankly the sisters declared: “We </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">are </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses and we shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">continue</span><span class="font5"> to be Jehovah’s witnesses!” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These statements show how inflexible the Witnesses were in refusing to sign up with the Devil. Contrast, if you please, this stand taken by Jehovah’s witnesses with that taken by the pseudoChristians of Vatican City in signing concordats with Mussolini (1929), Hitler (1933), and Franco (1941). Even a blind bat can see which ones are the genuine Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Ye are in the world but not of it,’ was a maxim laid down by Christ, the Leader of these Christians of Germany. So they would not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“he'd</span><span class="font7"> Hitler”, salute men, take part in the so-called “elections”, or participate in flag and swastika ceremonies. Neither would they work for the Nazi war machine even though they were beaten without mercy and threatened with death. In Buchenwald, for example, the prisoners were compelled, under the threat of being shot, to work in an underground war plant making V-bombs. Jehovah’s witnesses put their trust in God and refused to do such work on the grounds that it was a violation of the divine law. They were never shot. But, says the report, “Most of the prisoners who did work in the V-weapon factory were killed in a bombing raid.” A clear manifestation of the Lord’s protection over those who obey His law and not man’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christians in Buchenwald</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An American soldier, after meeting one of the faithful Witnesses who had been released from Buchenwald, wrote in August 1.945:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as I had my first look at him I could easily tell that he had been in a concentration camp. He was thin, his cheeks sunk in and his eyes were sunk back in his head. But he did not seem hopeless and lost like so many other former concentration camp inmates I’d seen. His eyes had a warm, friendly look and he had an air of confidence about himself. He told me about the eight years he spent in Buchenwald and he said that many, many of the other hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses who were there died of torture, starvation, and many were killed outright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sir K. ft. van Staal, director of the Netherland newspaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Het Parool,</span><span class="font7"> who was one of the prisoners of Buchenwald, wrote among other things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Netherlanders bore the letter “N”. The political prisoners had this letter imprinted on a red triangle, with the exception of Jehovah’s witnesses, among which there were also Hollanders, whom the Germans called Bible Students and marked with a purple triangle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This sect were, because of their </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">faith,</span><span class="font5"> opposers of the National Socialism and its members testified about it regardless of prohibitions and punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A number of times they were called to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tower [office], where they were offered the opportunity of being set at liberty, provided they would sign a declaration withdrawing their predictions (apparently the Nazis had a more superstitious fear of these Jehovah’s witnesses than they were willing to admit). Not one man would sign the desired declaration ’ I . . . Those who were in the concentration * camps the longest were the German communists, social democrats and the so-called Bible Students, who had been arrested since 1933 and 1934. [1946 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font5"> pages 167, 168]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a B.B.C. German Overseas Service Program from London on May 6, 1945, the following report was given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the prisoners who had been locked up in Buchenwald ever since the camp has been in existence—that means eight whole years—there are about 300 men who had been brought there because of the Christian faith . . . Most of the Christian prisoners are Bible Students . . . The hardest work was imposed on those Christian prisoners. They had to work in the quarry most of the time, and from there they were forced to pull up fully loaded lorries at running pace, all the time being ill-treated with truncheons by the S. S. under whose severest guard they were kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every three months the Christian prisoners Were given a form to sign. It was a declaration that the person in question would desist from his false doctrine. To sign this means immediate liberty. But never did it happen that these Christians signed such declaration. For Hitler it seemed to mean very much to get the signatures' of the Christians. Every day some of the prisoners were called and beaten with all possible and impossible objects to enforce their signatures . . . Most of the prisoners look like skeletons now. But a minister with a violet triangle told me, “Already in 1939 we were shadows when we marched to the -quarry. We ate the green from the frees and bushes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But what sustained these witnesses and carried them through those long years of persecution? It was their implicit trust, hope and confidence in Jehovah God and His. precious promises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Faith—so solid and well founded on the Bible and its Author that not even eight years of Nazi quarry-blasting could shake it loose! On this point the B.B.C. report continues and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It turned out that the number of deaths was comparatively low amongst the Christian prisoners, in spite of the bad treatment and the systematic starvation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Faith</span><span class="font5"> has sustained us,” they declare, “the belief that God will justly avenge us has kept us. Strict rules of life and putting divine laws into practice are the foundation of our inflexible steadfastness.” Other prisoners confirmed -that from the beginning to the end the position .of the Christian prisoners was a unique anti-fascistie manifestation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also the opinion of Mr. Bjorn HalL strom, London editor of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Svenska Mor-genbladet,</span><span class="font7"> is interesting on this matter of faith. In his letter of May 18,1945, to the London office of the Watchtower Society, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When I recently visited the Buchenwald Concentration Camp, I came across the prisoners belonging to the Society of “Bibel-forscher”. I have written and broadcast extensively about their sufferings in the camp. As a matter of fact, they were treated worse than any other group, but they managed, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">through their belief in God,</span><span class="font5"> to survive better than any others. The other prisoners testified to that as well! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Starvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hunger among these Christian martyrs was not limited to Buchenwald; it was suffered in all the camps. From another camp a report on this says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can you imagine what tempests have swept over us in these times intending to shake us and to lead us to disunity and unfaithfulness! Indeed, Satan left nothing unattempted. From outside the.hardest drudgery; shoveling sand, carrying stones, carting earth, excavation work, etc.; severe treatment, by far insufficient nourishment: potato peelings, weeds, bunches of flowers, even wood shavings and anything else found its way into our stomachs in order to benumb the horrible feeling' of hunger. We became as thin as skeletons. Twice such a starvation diet lasting for months! Often we thought it was our end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Insufficient rest due to crowded living conditions, especially in the punishment block, added to the suffering of hunger. These blocks were built to accommodate 100 persons, but 400 were required to live in them. Later this figure was increased to 875, and in the last days before the crack-up wheii these blocks were used as transient stations for passing transports, 1,200 and 1,500 were jammed in. On one occasion 1,880 were literally packed in I What a terrible fight there was at the end of the day! Some would get near enough to the table to get something to eat; others would go hungry and grab a few square inches of space to lie down on; while the latecomers got neither food nor bed. In these barracks, with a few exceptions, were the most wicked element of the camp. Nothing was safe, not even one’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Faithfulness Under a Butcher’s Knife</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If your spirit hasn’t been stirred by these indignities against humanity in general, and Christians in particular, then read the following incident that happened to a dear old lady of 63. It is enough to make the blood of a cold fish boil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When our work was changed, I was sent 'to a laundry. There the work was also very hard, and I became ruptured. I was sent to the barrack for the sick and was operated upon. The doctor said to me: “You Bible worm, if you die, then your Jehovah is' responsible.” During the operation he said: “Bible worm, we have now a good opportunity: tell me now, what is Armageddon?” I answered: “Doctor, when Armageddon comes nobody will need to ask that question any more, for the whole world will know, and you too, Doctor.” When I was operated upon he said: “When you are quite well again, come forward and sign and go home to your husband.” I answered: “I cannot go to my husband, for he is also in the concentration camp; and as for signing, that</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Showing some of the Nazi concentration camps</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">does not come into the question so far as I am concerned.” Then he was quiet. He visited me for a week, and then the nurse said to him: “Look, now, at the old woman. How wonderful the wound has healed.” “Yes,” said the doctor, “Jehovah has helped her.” Yes, I can truthfully say that Jehovah helped me, otherwise *1 would not be alive, for I was an “experiment rabbit”, if you know what that means. The nurse said to me: “The kind of rupture you have cannot be operated upon.’ It is fatal.” But Jehovah did not permit that, all thanks to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Dachau Jehovah’s witnesses were used as human “guinea pigs” against their will and many died as a result. Also in that slaughterhouse “the invalids, brethren and invalid prisoners, were gassed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another inhuman and grueling torture practiced in all the camps was the “Roll Call”. Overworked and with insufficient sleep prisoners were forced to get up at five o’clock in the morning and stand out* doors for an hour or two, rain or shine, hot or cold, while the roll was called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once a prisoner escaped. The siren sounded and everyone had to leave the “block”. This was at half past two in the night. The whole eamp had to turn out and stand on parade until eleven o’clock the next morning. We received nothing to eat the whole day. After a couple of days the prisoner was caught and everyone had to stand on parade again. What a terrible sight it was I Tom by dogs, she was led around the camp in order to frighten the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lichtenburg</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this camp there were a number of Jehovah’s witnesses, most of whom were women. One day one of the Christian women was called to the director. After all efforts to make her change her mind about signing had failed, they threw her into a dungeon with only a stone bench built in the wall for a bed. There she remained alone for over half a year. Her health suffered very much but she remained unshakable in her faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The rest of Jehovah’s witnesses were kept in a special block known as “station No. 4”. Here there was always a shortage of food, and it had the most cruel of the guards. Because of the obstinate refusal of these <sup>!</sup> Christians the director, Ta-maschke by name, was often heard to say, “They should be stood against the wall.” This “obstinacy” consisted of refusing to assemble with the rest of the prisoners to listen to the speeches of the Nazi party leaders. The official report of this incident made to the Berlin authorities at the conclusion of the war says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The climax was reached in October, 1938, when they tried to force us again to listen to a Nazi talk. Because we refused, the SS and women guards became very embittered and angry, and beat us with their fists and heavy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">key-chains and kicked us down the stairs, and in this did not even consider the age and sickness of the women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the next talk they had, on October 6, 1938, they had already taken measures to bring us into the courtyard. They attached the fire hose to the hydrants, and when we refused in the evening to listen to the talk they opened the hydrants and trained the fire .hose against us. AH those who were hit with the water were . badly bruised and showed blood spots under ' the skin. Soon station No. 4 was completely under water. The water ran down the stairs. Those who had not been pushed through the door by the force of the stream were mistreated and brought into the courtyard. Soaked to the skin the^ had to stay during this cold October evening and listen to the talk. Furthermore they put us under heavy guard for fourteen days. When they saw the futility of their efforts to force us this way, and because it made so much commotion that even the population of Prettin heard about it, they stopped their strong-arm tactics. The leaders of the camp saw to it, however, that we were deprived of privileges. For instance, we were permitted to write only five lines every four months and could buy only two marks’ worth of goods every two weeks. This continued until February, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That is a sample of the “noble” qualities of Nazi manhood; an outrage perpetrated against defenseless women. It would be torture enough for men to experience, but when we think of knocking women down with a fire hose-at pointblank range, causing the skin to become bloodshot, and then dragging the poor creatures out and standing them up drenching wet in freezing October weather to listen to the ravings of a demonized Nazi, it fills one with righteous indignation. A sane man would never treat a dog that way; but, alas, these victims were representatives of the Most High God. One trembles to think of the awful recompense that will shortly be poured out in full measure on these criminals by the High and Lofty One, who thunders: “Vengeance is mine: I will repay.” —-Romans 12:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By putting their implicit trust in these sure promises contained in Sacred Writ Christian martyrs of the twentieth-century Inquisition were able to withstand the onslaughts of the demons. They were not like others round about them, who, without faith, lived in a condition of hopeless despair. Rather these witnesses of the Lord looked forward with eagerness to the day when they would again be free to take up their house-to-house preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Organizing for Final Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Allentown </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Call,</span><span class="font7"> noting this faithfulness of Christians under persecution, published an enlightening editorial on November 19, 1945:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses in Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Conviction of a large group of Germans who operated the Belsen and Oswiecim concentration camps in Germany during the war was attended at the same time by acquittal of fourteen women and men which indicates that, while feeling was running high at the trials and memory has not failed as to the enormous atrocities committed against thousands of people in these camps and the wanton destruction of even more than escaped, passion was not permitted to prevail. In the end, the innocent who had been caught in the dragnet with the guilty were absolved. Or if they had been guilty, evidence failed to show it and in accord with our system which is operating now for the benefit of the Germans, they will go free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the victims in these and other camps were for the most part Jews and Russians, with a sprinkling of people of just about all the countries of Eastern Europe who had fallen into German hands, some of the camps at least had a very large number of Germans, not of Semitic stock. Even Germans whose Aryan descent was not in the slightest doubt fell victims of the cruelty that was of the very essence of Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, This fact is brought to our attention again by the journey abroad of a former Allen-tonian, Nathan Knorr, who now is the head of that large and growing sect, Jehovah’s witnesses. He has gone to Germany [surrounding </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY E, </span><span class="font5">1946 countries] to rally the large number of German members of this sect who had run afoul of the Nazis just as they ran afoul of our own American government through interpretation of their religious tenets which denies salute to the flag, military service and other matters. In Germany the treatment they received in prison camps was almost on a par with that accorded former German enemies in the war, but according to reports, those who survived the treatment have emerged like those early Christians who survived Roman martyrdom to carry their faith into all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is to bring the consolation of their American fellows to these now freed and free Germans, who certainly never were Nazis, that takes Mr. Knorr into that country. And with him goes the hope of his sect that there may be growth in their numbers as they go forth with their customary missionary spirit, for theirs is a dynamic, evangelistic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tempered in the fire of persecution and the severest suffering, they can be expected to carry their doctrine far and wide in Europe, for such is the nature of man that he becomes steeled in vicissitudes and his religion becomes the stronger and the more governing force in his life according as he has had to struggle and suffer to maintain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostles and disciples of Christ when persecuted “went every where preaching the word”. (Acts 8:4) So also will these witnesses of Jehovah in Germany continue to fulfill their commission, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.”-—Matthew 28:19, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such zeal and determination to continue on, after passing through this twentieth-century Inquisition, comes from having 'and exercising faith. The raging sea of wild Nazi terrorism dashing against these witnesses for ten years failed to sweep them away, because this faith was anchored in a solid Rock. In the words of the psalmist they say: “Jehovah is my bock, and my fortress, and my deliverer.”-Ps. 18:2, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan, Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Faithful women endured more In the Nazi concentration camps than here related. In the next Issue of “Consolation&quot; more of this heart-rending story will be told.)</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Opposition to Freedom in Freedom, Pa.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font7"> PUBLIC meeting campaign was be. ing held in the town of . Freedom, Pa., at the public high school auditorium. The first two meetings of the series went j along fine, with attendances of 107 and 4 102 respectively. It so happened that the next week was the time for the distribution of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> No. 678 to all the officials, and seemingly it shocked the religious susceptibilities of a certain organi-, zation with headquarters at Rome. Catholic Action began immediately, by those of that faith bringing pressure on the members of the school board. While the • leading members of the school board were not Catholic, they took the “easy” way out by canceling further use of the high school auditorium to Jehovah’s witnesses to continue with the last two lee-tures of the series. The chairman of the auditorium committee gave the reason that the school building supported by taxpayers’ money could not be used to “pan” Catholics. He since stated, “If you just had not put outdhat magazine when you did, everything would have been all right” This occurred Friday night</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not giving up, they interviewed this same man again Saturday morning to see if some arrangement could be made to hold this one meeting (the next week Was going to be canceled anyway because of the Cleveland meeting). He was contacted at a barbershop and stated, “I told you Friday, that I could not do anything for you. I was commissioned by the board to advise you that you could not have the school for any more lectures. The Catholics in town say that if Jehovah’s witnesses want to smear the Catholics let them build a church like the rest, but they cannot use a building supported by the taxpayers’ money. They objected to paying taxes on a school and have it used to ridicule Catholics. I received many phone calls from Catholics objecting to you having the school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was asked, “Did you receive any phone calls from Protestants or others ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To which he replied, “No, not one.” ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was then asked, “Then you attribute the cancellation of the school for use by Jehovah’s witnesses entirely to Catholic Action in Freedom?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Answer, “Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then it was decided to contact a local doctor, Who was president of the school board. While this interview was brief, it will be noted how he admitted he was bowing down to Catholic Aption in Freedom ; because this is what he stated when he noted we were Jehovah’s witnesses: “I have spent sixteen hours on the telephone this week on account of you fellows and 1 don’t want anymore of it. You are not going to get the school. You have been delivering some papers in town and you cannot do that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He was asked, “Are you going to bow down to Catholic Action like that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reply, “Yes, by God! Right or wrong. I got a lot of sick people to look after. Good day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The meeting was advertised just as though nothing happened. Attempts were made to locate another place, but these proved futile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While it rained Sunday morning, and up to about 1: 00 (meeting at 3:00) we began to wonder what we were going to do, as we planned an outdoor meeting. It soon stopped raining, and shortly thereafter the sun began to shine. Just before meeting time the crowd began to gather in front: of the school, and by meeting time 123 persons had assembled to hear the talk, as shown in the accompanying picture. Not over 200 feet away there was a steep side street, so steep, in fact, that there is a concrete block at the bottom and top to prevent car traffic, apd the crowd was moved over to it and stood in a close semicircle about the speaker, and all heard the talk, “Two Worlds in Final War,” without any further disturbance. They all stood attentively during the talk. The second picture was taken during the talk. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">While the meeting was in progress the chief of police and the burgess (mayor) drove up and stopped a couple of times, . and it was later learned that someone overheard them saying, ‘There was good order and there was nothing we could do about it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was learned later that some of the broadminded taxpayers were indignant, as they too were taxpayers and believed that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">freedom</span><span class="font7"> should be upheld for all rather than bowing to a foreign power that always is the enemy of freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil’s attempt to thwart the Lord’s work again failed miserably, as a greater number heard this talk than either of the previous two of the series. It demonstrates that the Lord’s arm is not shortened and that where an effort is put forth the Lord’s blessing is manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All thanks are given to Jehovah in the aiding of His servants to overcome obstacles to the praise of His name. We rejoice in singing His praise with the psalmist as recorded in Psalm 96:1, 2, 4 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.),</span><span class="font7"> “Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth. Sing unto Jehovah, bless his name; . . . For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised.’’-Contributed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>It Is High Time the Jews Awoke</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH GOD is not seeking to bless the obdurate and the conceited, no matter what may be their physical ancestry. “For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to' revive the heart of the contrite ones.”—Isaiah 57:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nothing is more beautiful than the spirit of any man or woman, Jew or Gentile, who is really meek. “The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.” (Psalm 25:9) “The Lord lifteth up the meek; he casteth the wicked down to the ground.” (Psalm 147:6) &quot;The Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.” (Psalm 149:4) “With righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth.” (Isaiah 11:4) “The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord.” (Isaiah 29:19) “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth.” (Zephaniah 2:3) “The meek shall eat and be satisfied.” —Psalm 22 : 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jews ought to be able to understand those scriptures, as well as the statement of the psalmist “The meek shall inherit the earth” (Psalm 37; 11), and the words of Jesus, &quot;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matthew 5: 5) So, why can’t the Jews for once and for all learn true humbleness and realize that they are no better than and no different from other people, and that if they wish salvation they must take it in God’s way and not seek it otherwise! ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sufferings of the Jews have been truly terrible. The Romans put 1,100,000 to the sword in the destruction of Jerusalem, but the meek ones, who heeded the counsel of the One that was &quot;meek and lowly of heart”, not only found rest to their souls, but were spared from death or captivity in that calamity that befell ail but the followers of Jesus. The Jews were banished from France in 1192, from England in 1290, from France again in 1394, from Spain in 1492, from Portugal in 1496, from Naples and Sicily in 1504, from Prague in 1520, from France a third time in 1615, and from Russia in 1795. The terrible sufferings under Hitler and his comrades are too recent to need any mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Are the Jews Meek?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no evidence in the Scriptures that the Jews as a people are meek. On the contrary, Jehovah’s witnesses not</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">only find it stated in the Bible that the Jews are “stiff-necked and hard-hearted’’, but when they call at their homes with the message of God’s kingdom they witness the same characteristics. They seem to think that because they are Jews, and were once God’s chosen people, they must ever remain that way. Nothing could be a worse mistake. Many Protestants have a similar hallucination, that because they “believe in Jesus” therefore they are “saved”. They forget that “the devils also believe and tremble” and that nobody is really saved until he gets to the end of the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In recent years there has been a tremendous effort to, reinstate the Jews in Palestine, but there is no evidence of the Lord’s blessing upon such reinstatement. Palestine-is but a small country, only slightly larger than the combined areas of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, it has but a relatively small area of arable land, and the political obstacles are at present insurmountable. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jews themselves claim that there are 600,000 Jews there now, and that 2,000,000 more could be accommodated shortly, and that within ten years the land could accommodate a Jewish population of 5,000,000, and all without dispossessing a single Arab. They also claim that when outsiders did not interfere they had no difficulty in getting on with the Arabs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now they are in straits. Of the 6,500,000 Jews on the Continent, outside Russia, only 1,500,000 survived Hitler’s reign of terror; and although the Jews had more than 1,000,000 soldiers in all Allied armies, 35,000 of whom volunteered in Palestine itself, yet these people were given no place at the San Francisco conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no evidence that if the Jews got the whole of Palestine they would ever willingly surrender to Him whose right it is to rule all the earth. A group of 50,000 men and women are so sure that they are God’s elect to govern Palestine that several acts of violence have been traced to them, such as the throwing of bombs, the killing of police officials, and the assassination of Lord Moyne, British minister resident in the Middle East. But that does not get them anything of favor with -either God or man.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Why Do So Many Jews Cringe Before the Hierarchy?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HOUGH not a Christian, I take this opportunity to express my admiration for your courageous stand on all problems of our times, social, economic, religious. I most admire your heroic (for it takes plenty of courage and forthrightness to attack such a powerful world organization) struggle against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a Jew who has spent many years of his life in Catholic-controlled countries, and who has seen them in action when they had the power in their hands, I could never understand the apparent sympathy of the Jews of the United States towards ’ the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, as it was exemplified, for instance, in the Smith-Hoover presidential election in 1928. How could those Jews, with the memory of the pogroms in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia still in their minds, join in partnership with the same type of individuals as caused our miseries since the Middle Ages?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I wish to congratulate you again and again on your courageous stand on all questions of justice, and your fearless expose of those who are false Christians. May Jehovah give you strength, courage and long life.—A first lieutenant in the medical section of a United States separation center in Pennsylvania.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>God’s Name versus a Trinity</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HE last of Christ’s faithful apostles died near the end of the first century of our era. Toward the end of the next century there arose a Latin scholar, name Tertullian, who gave out the theory that Christ was Almighty God himself, and used the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">trinitas </span><span class="font7">(Latin for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">trinity)</span><span class="font7"> to give the idea of three persons of one substance ip one god, A contemporary 'of Tertullian, namely, one Theophilus of Antioch, used the Greek -word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">trias</span><span class="font7"> in his writings about A.D. 180, and from which word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">trinitas</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">trinity</span><span class="font7"> is drawn. That doctrine as taught today, according to the creed of the Church of England, is: “There is but one living and true God, . . . and in unity of this God-Head there be three persons of one substance, power and eternity; the Father, The Word, and the Holy Ghost.” What is the result of such doctrine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a noticeable fact that in the religious sects of “Christendom” the name of Jesus has been made more prominent than that of Almighty God. Catholic clergy have induced their parishioners to pray to Mary, the human mother of the child Jesus, and to worship her, giving this woman worship which, however, they are hasty to explain is not worship equal to that given to God. In the religious systems the names of Mary and Jesus are oftener 'mentioned than is the name which Almighty God gives to himself in the Sacred Scriptures, namely, Jehovah. The very titles or names which this One gives to himself in His Word do of themselves disprove a trinity of three persons of “one substance, power and eternity”. <sub>v</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In flat contradiction of a “trinity”, His Word teaches there is but one God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the Giver of life to all creatures. Christ Jesus is the Son of God, the beginning (not the author) of God’s creation, and the great executive officer of Jehovah God in carrying His purposes into operation. The holy spirit (old-fashionedly called “the holy ghost”) is the invisible active force of God, and not a person at all; and hence God can pour this spirit out upon or give it to those who are in full harmony with Him and who are assigned to perform service in His name. Let the proof of the above be made from God’s Word, not Tertullian’s or Theophilus’ word, and then let honest people abide by that. As Romans 3:4 reads: “Let God prove to be true albeit every man be false Rotherham’s translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is but one First Cause, namely, He who is “from everlasting to everlasting” and “whose name alone is Jehovah” as stated at Psalm 90:2- and Psalm 83:18. The immortality of which He is possessed He does not make the common property of His creatures: ‘“who only hath immortality, . . . whom no man hath seen nor can see,” because He is divine. (1 Timothy 6 :16) At the prophecy of Isaiah 45:5 He states: “I am Jehovah, and there is none else; besides me there is no God.” At Isaiah 43:11: “I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.” At Isaiah 42:8: “I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give, to another, neither my praise unto graven images.” (According to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This great First Cause revealed himself to His creatures by various names or titles, each of which is deeply significant and does not admit of trinitariap co-equals. The name “God”, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">elohim </span><span class="font7">in the Hebrew’ original text, appears in the Bible in connection with the beginning of creation, at Genesis 1:1. That name or designation especially refers to Jehovah as the Creator of heaven and earth and the Giver of breath to earthly creatures. “Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit [not a trinitarian ghost, however] to them that walk therein.” (Isaiah 42:5, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> Thus </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God,</span><span class="font7"> as a designation, represents Him as the First Cause and refers to His responsibility as regards all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To faithful Abraham Jehovah declared himself under the name or designation “Almighty God”, according to Genesis 17:1. Such name was spoken in connection with His covenant with Abraham. At that time Jehovah said, in substance, to Abraham: T have made and do now make a covenant with you that you shall be the father of many nations and this shall be signified by your name which is changed now from Abram to Abraham. I am the Almighty God.’ Such name ‘Almighty God” was a complete guarantee to Abraham of the great Eternal One’s unlimited ability to carry into operation His announced purpose. Abraham was then an aged man; his wife also .was past the years of bearing children. Jehovah had told him that there should be a son born to him by his aged wife and, in effect, He said to Abraham: <sup>c</sup>My name Almighty God is a guarantee that this shall come to pass.’ Jehovah also used the name “God Almighty” to Abraham’s grandson Jacob.* (Genesis 35:11) It indicates the unlimited power of Jehovah, and that for Him to will a thing means it shall be done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>t</sub> To the prophet. Moses God declared himself most positively by the name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font7"> Some translators have rendered this name merely as “Self-existing One” or “The Eternal”. It means much more than that; jt signifies God’s purpose toward His people. God chose Israel as His peculiar people; and Jehovah was the name by which that people knew ..’Him. God directed Moses to go to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Israelites and tell them’Jehovah had . sent^ him; and then His words to Moses showed the meaning of the name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font7"> because stating His purpose. He said: “Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I'am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem'you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and -ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[elohim],</span><span class="font7"> who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.” (Exodus 6:1-8, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> The name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font7"> signifies to God’s chosen people His purposes concerning them, and specifically His purposes concerning His Son Christ Jesus and “the church of God”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* By King Melehizedek Jehovah revealed himself by the name Most High: “Blessed be God Most High.” And Abraham said: “I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth.” (Genesis 14:20,22, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> Hence Jehovah’s Son, Christ Jesus, is not on a level with His Father Jehovah, who is the Supreme One or Most High. This name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Most High </span><span class="font7">refers to Jehovah’s relationship to all His creation, including His only begotten Son; it refers to Him as the Suprenie Ruler over all powers and principalities. Anything and everything that is held in possession by any creature Is both from and subject to the will of the Most High. He is above all. There is none like Hirn, and no power can prevent His carrying out His will. The name bespeaks supremacy of the One to whom all governments, powers and creatures must in due time be in subjection. He is the Author, the Maker, the Executor, and the Finisher of His purpose. He works through His chosen instruments to accomplish His</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">will and purposes. “The most High dwell-eth not in temples made with [human] hands.” (Acts 7:48) What then!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">*It is a dishonor to God’s name and a reproach to Him to teach the people that . there are three co-equal persons in one 1</span></p>

<div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Many Inventions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HIS is a little story about some of the latest inventions. Man is an inventive animal. Not all of his inventions are good ones. The wise man indicates this when he says, “Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions [or, evil devices].”—Ecclesiastes 7; 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Aord </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">chishshabown,</span><span class="font7"> above translated “inventions”, occurs but twice in Holy Writ. The other place is at 2 Chronicles 26:15, where it is translated “engines”, and because of 'the big mistake that King Uzziah made when he turned from doing “that which was right in the sight of the Lord” (2 Chronicles 26:4), it will be just as well to quote a little from the Scriptures. It seems that Uzziah was the outstanding armament builder of his day, “And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and as long as he sought [Jehovah], God made him to prosper.”—2 Chronicles 26:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims. And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem . at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them. Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God and one God in three co-eternal persons of one substance. The great Jehovah God is completely separate and distinct from all. He is the Creator. AH others, including His Son Jesus Christ, are creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred. And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to east stones. And he made in Jerusalem engines </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[chishshabown],</span><span class="font5"> invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against [Jehovah] his God, and went into the temple of [Jehovah] to burn incense upon the altar of incense. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of [Jehovah], that were valiant-men: and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto [Jehovah], but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from [Jehovah] God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of [Jehovah], from beside the incense altar. And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead,' and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because [Jehovah] had smitten him. And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death.—2 Chronicles 26: 6-21,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Uneasiness About Atomic Bomb</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The atomic bomb kills at four miles from the point where it hits, and blinds at five miles. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">PM</span><span class="font7"> says, “The atomic bomb is the mightiest military weapon yet devised, but it isn’t God.” That should make some stop and think. This little story about inventions is not a story about the atomic bomb, but the bomb is an outstanding invention. Said Edward M. Knapp, in the Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald</span><span class="font7"> of August 15, 1945 :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ The apparent lack of response by people of this country to the use of the atom bomb has seared a lot of us. Has this country lost its soul that it approves such barbarism on the ground that it shortens the war or the ground that the Japanese deserve to be exterminated? If the end of the war justifies this weapon, then America is far gone on the cynical road to empire. We have won the war but we have lost our own soul in the process. Hitler and Himmler have conquered the country with their ideas and the brutality of Nazi Germany is only one step removed in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, atomic energy has stupendous possibilities for good. The way the columnist Frederick C. Othman puts it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A furnace not much bigger than a cigarette case should heat your house; you’ll feed the firebox with a teaspoon instead of a coal scoop. Atoms will run your automobile and you won’t ever have to fill the tank; the manufacturer will put in enough fuel to last the life of the car. And so on. Everything that moves except your own feet, will be propelled by atomic power. The human race could kill itself off with atomic bombs, but everybody knows it, and that fact, itself, may prevent future wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Said the columnist David Lawrence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They [the scientists] said . . . that a single five- or ten-pound chunk of 17-235 uranium, activated merely by contact with cold water, could, theoretically, drive an ocean liner about the world indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">But LeTs Get Back to Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the world is trying to figure out how to use the new power, it is still engaged in wearing clothes. Great changes are under way in clothing materials. One of the new fabrics, koroseal, made of coke, limestone and salt, is corrosive-resistant, waterproof, flexible, and odorless, and will work up nicely into suits and dresses. It comes in four different forms, one of which is transparent, and may be used to coat other fabrics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you don’t like the idea of appearing in public dressed in coke, limestone and salt, you can come out in soybeans, something that you can raise in your own back yard. From these the chemists are now* making an artificial fiber that keeps its strength well, wet or dry, and has already been made into suitings, hosiery, underwear, hats, blankets, rugs, carpets, and upholstery, and all with satisfactory results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Or if your taste is hard to .satisfy, you can be dressed in feathers. This is no joke. The United States Rubber Company has brought out a new cloth that looks like wool, but is warmer, softer and lighter: can be dyed any color; possesses a brilliant luster; is odorless; shrinks no more than cotton, and is suitable for suits, dresses, sweaters, and other wearing apparel. This new material, which is 60 to 70 percent feathers, is particularly adaptable for admixture with other staple textiles, such as cotton, wool, rayon, and nylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, you know all about nylon. But if you do, you know more about it than the makers themselves. They are still experimenting, and besides the stockings, which you have seen in the store windows and elsewhere, nylon has</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• been used for handbags, luggage, zippers, surgi cal sutures, bristles for toothbrushes and hairbrushes, drinking cups _which when smashed fiat will spring back to their original shape, insulation for electric wires, wrappings for delicate and perishable goods, and shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">4 Oh, yes! about the shoes. If you don’t like the kind you have always worn, maybe it won’t be Jong before you can get a pair of those new Plexiglas shoes which they are beginning to make in Prague, Czechoslovakia. They would be farther along with this job if it hadn’t been for the big attempt that Paeelli and Hitler made to grab the world; but now they are returning to their former position as the world’s principal shoeexporters. The Plexiglas shoes are very easy to walk in and all you have to do to get an A-l “shine” is to wipe them with a wet rag. No 'polish or brush is needed. Musical instruments have been made of the same materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Finespun Glass and Steel</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Great advances have been made in the art of spinning glass and steel. The glass fibers are so small that it takes 4,000 of them, laid side by side, to make a band an inch wide; fifty miles of glass fiber may be spun from a globule no larger than a marble. Though gowns have been made of this, and glass cloth is moth-, fire- and acid-proof, glass dresses are yet remote. You will have to wait a while; there .are too many other things that must be done first. However, you will be greatly interested to know that glass can now be welded to metal in such a manner that they cannot be separated, and there are new glasses which, when broken, have no cutting edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But while the glass stockings and dresses are still a little way ahead, the girls will soon be wearing hosiery made from stainless steel. Not that the girls will go around clad in armor, but, as columnist Albert Leman puts it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several concerns already are turning out for war purposes stainless steel wire comparable in diameter to silk and nylon threads. The sheerness of these pliable strands meets exacting Fifth Avenue standards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tn the same interesting column, Mr. Leman mentions the substance which, coursing through the radiators, can make them radiate heat in the winter and cold in the summer; glass plumbing that cannot freeze; noiseless egg-beaters made of paper, and fine-grade paints made from sweet potato starch. And just to help us all to realize the debt we owe to the &lt;&nbsp;Creator, let us all take knowledge of the fact, mentioned by Mr. Leman, that there are now more than 100,000 by-products made from coal. “And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.” —1 Corinthians 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">People Will Continue to Eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy continues to brag about its saints that seldom or never ate (when 'anybody was looking), but most honest people are interested in three meals a day (five in Britain); so we are all delighted to know that a California man has invented a fruit reshaping machine, which pushes fruit back into shape after the pit has been removed. Pears, Japanese persimmons and berries do not need any shaping; they were Shaped right in the first place. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fruit has to keep long enough to get to the table; and it is promised that the new rubber plastic called Pliofilm will do just that. Any fruit, grown anywhere in the world, can be safely shipped’to any other part of the world and arrive in perfect condition for consumption. Perfectly transparent, this fabric, when heated for a few seconds, can be stretched around any fruit, fitting it perfectly. The fabric can also be used for wrapping cheeses for market, thus preventing the formation of rinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do you enjoy tomatoes? An ingenious farmer, near Lancaster, Pa., has in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">vented a practical tomato-picker. The . worker lies suspended in a hammock, with his head in a baseball catcher’s mask. He is drawn very slowly across the field, and picks a ton of tomatoes a day, and enjoys it, instead of picking 1,200 pounds by the old method of stooping to the task. The truck that hauls the man has hammocks for six workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Says F. O. Richey, of Cleveland, in a letter to the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man with modern agricultural machinery can. produce twenty-five to fifty times as much food as he could 150 years ago. In 1935 a man could produce ten times as many automobile tires as he could in 1920. Right now, with 11,000,000, to 15,000,000 men eating and ' not producing, the country in normal times is so full of food that we cannot consume it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now something about that delightful, ' delectable, delicious poison which goes ■ by the name of coffee. It seems that this little bean is laden with 15 percent of fats and oils, and a new method has been devised by which these beans, whether roasted, partly roasted, or green, may be made into a soap of excellent quality. Even the “grounds” may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cain Built the First City</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cain built the first city. There is no mention that Adam and Eve had any house or wanted any house, and it may be that in some future time men and women and children will literally “dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods”; but since Jesus was a carpenter, and himself lived in a house until He began His ministry, it looks as if humans would be interested in houses for a long time to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It isn’t going to be such a job keeping the house clean as it used to be. After years of experimenting, a method has been devised of burning soft coal without causing any smoke. One of the employees of the Louisville &amp;&nbsp;Nashville Railroad Company explained:.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There’s no magic about it. We just get the right mixture </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> air and gas for complete combustion, as in an automobile carburetor. We put three intakes on each side of the engine. Boiler steam rushes through, and draws air into the firebox through jets the size of pencils, staggered to make a swirling mixture of oxygen with coal gases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people that have been deprived of fresh air too long think that they must always live in the same temperature. To help such there is now a device by which a thermostat is pressed constantly against a windowpane, and changes in the actual temperature of the glass affect the electrically operated heat control of the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Radio and Television</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Radio is here to stay and television is already being advertised. The location of radio transmitters has become such a fine art that if one is placed in a large building the Radio Intelligence Division man, aided by the “snifter” that he carries in his hand, can walk direct to the exact room. Testing the efficiency of these men in Hawaii, a transmitter was hidden in a private home far off in the hills, and the Radio Intelligence Division men were at the home in just 52 minutes from the time they were asked to find if. About 6,000 radio bearings are taken monthly. No foreign transmitters could operate from America without being caught right away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is now possible to send by wire or radio human speech which has been so scrambled that it means absolutely nothing except to the person who is provided with the necessary apparatus to make it intelligible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The police department of New York city is now equipped with a two-way telephone system which enables drivers of police cars to converse with headquarters at will. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is now able to install the same device in any business house, doctor’s car, or office; airplane operators may also communicate both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The practical use of electric power, transmitted without wires, is definitely on the way.

Rafts are provided with electric lights, very small in size, but so powerful that they may be seen for seventy miles. These are operated with a hand-cranked generator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are now three methods by which men adrift may procure water: (l)by catching rainfall in tarpaulins and transferring it to empty food tins, (2) by using a chemical sea-water desalting kit; and (3) by a new device consisting of an ingeniously planned plastic envelope 30 inches by 12 inches in size which, on a hot day, will use the heat of the sun to salvage one pint of drinking water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the secrets of successfully landing planes in Britain in dense fogs was that, at great expense, the fog was burned over landing fields in areas a mile long and 450 feet wide. This was done ■ by an ingenious arrangement of pipes perforated with tiny holes at short intervals. When the oil issuing from these holes was lit, a wall of flame cleared the fog by raising the temperature seven degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the many recently patented devices for negotiating sluggish streams, swamps and snows, one is a so-called “snoplane”.

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HE London Catholic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span><span class="font7"> was founded in 1860, at the beginning of the Civil War, and was so highly respected by the late Achille Ratti, onetime Pope Pius XI, that he sent them this special message:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a journal consecrates itself to the ■ apostolate ,of truth and virtue for the good of souls and for the greater glory of God and of His Church, there is no blessing which it does not merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spread out on the desk is one of its late issues. The first thing in the paper, in the upper left-hand corner of the first page, is an advertisement of Gordon’s Gin, which ought to be good gin if it is to merit such kind words from one who advertised himself as the one and only Vicar of Jesus Christ, “King of Heaven, Earth and Hell,” and proving it by the fact that he wears a three-story crown, the triple diadem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Going on into the wonderful things contained in this so much admired and appreciated publication is a story a column and a half long which bears the caption “Our Lady Has Foretold Russia’s Conversion at End of War”. It seems that the lady in question lives or did live in Fatima, Portugal, a country place some 75 miles north of Lisbon. There on May 13, 1917, and five times more during the summer, she told three little girls, 7, 9 and 10 years of age that the war then raging would soon end and “during the next Pontificate another and more terrible war will commence”.. Also they must consecrate to her immaculate heart, whatever that is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lady stubbed her toe. The next pontificate ended when the then Pope Pius- XI, Achille Ratti, passed away February 10, 1939, and a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font7"> pontificate, the present one, was more than six months old when the prophesied “more terrible war” commenced with the invasion of Poland. But, anyway, the lady went on to say to these little Portuguese children that the result would be that “Russia will be converted and there will be peace”. But w’hat is six months to the Hierarchy? Nothing at all. And so the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font7"> besides carrying the Gordon gin advertisement, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop da Silva of Leira issued a letter declaring that the apparitions are worthy of faith and permitting public devotion to Our Lady of Fatima. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cardinal at Lisbon also approved the humbug; so it must be O.K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conversion Gets Under Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For more than a thousand years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has tried to get control of the Greek Catholic Church, In recent years Kaiser Wilhelm II was to have been “The Sword of the Church”; but he couldn’t make it, and so the dubious honor went to Adolf Hitler. When that gentleman invaded Russia he took along a small army of Roman Catholic priests that were to put the religious cement o.n his prospective iron rule, but the cement did not stick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Drew Pearson knows about as much ■ of what is going on in the world as any current historian, and he says in one of his Merry-Go-Rounds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In several of his transatlantic talks with Archbishop • Spellman, Pius XII mentioned Russia and expressed hope that some way could be found to bring about a religious accord which would endure in postwar years. The pope made it clear that he looked to President Roosevelt to blaze the trail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That was in the summer of 1943, and it took a few months to think up some other way of getting Russia to hand over its religious business, or, at any rate, to keep Russia out of the pope’s religious dooryard in Poland. So Orlemanski was thought of, and his trip to see Stalin was one of the amusing incidents of the war. The idea that that priest could fly to Russia and back, and talk with Stalin himself about something that the pope felt must be talked about, and that . Roosevelt did not know anything about it, is funny. Commenting on it the columnist K. M. Landis II said, with his eyes to the ground:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you get right down to it, Secretary Hull had as much right to grant a passport to Father Orlemanski to see our ally Stalin, as be did to grant facilities to Archbishop Spellman to visit on r enemy Franco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Love Feast Postponed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Roosevelt and Stalin, Spellman and the pope, and Orlemanski and the press, did a good job. They got the pope and Stalin together, but they got them together with such suddenness that they both bumpfed their heads, and it was necessary to do something to persuade the gullible public that they were only joking all the time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few months after Orlemanski returned the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> carried a cable dispatch from its correspondent in Rome, Herbert L. Matthews, bearing the headlines “Rome Communists Received by Pope; Two in Municipal Junta Join Others in Audience; Party Amity with Church Gains.” In it Mr. Matthews explained that “the Communists could not have gone without the official sanction of their party”; that “on the pope’s part, it is believed to be the first time that he has given a private audience to a political group of that sort”; that “it was made clear by the Vatican that the junta sought this audience”; and:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the members were presented to the Pope and the Pucci, agency notes that while almost all kneeled and kissed the pope’s hand a few members simply bowed and shook hands. They were introduced by name and not by party and in none of the accounts of the audience are the names or parties printed, in other words, it was desired by the Vatican to give a non-partisan color to the whole proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To make that love story go down better, the tailpiece to the story, and printed immediately beneath it, was, believe it or not:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rome, July 12 (U.P.)—-The pope held a private audience today with Myron C. Taylor, President Roosevelt’s personal representative to the Vatican, and relations between Russia and the Vatican discussed, it was reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The very next day the United Press sent out another one, published in the Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald,</span><span class="font7"> and this time the dispatch was given a Vatican City date line, so that the cooling breezes could begin to blow off some of the surplus ardent affection, newly created, between the pope and Stalin. The headline in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald</span><span class="font7"> was “Vatican Aide, Italian Red Hold Parley”. Notice that the pope is out of it.' The Italian Communist leader is named. He confers with acting papal secretary of state, and so </span><span class="font5">establishing the first direct contact between the Communists and the Holy See and pointing to improved relations between Moscow and the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The conference takes place in a private home. That lets it down another peg. It was “of private character”. That blows off a little more of the steam or hot air. Then the report says that the two men &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hrcoli and Montini examined the possibility of a temporary alliance between Catholics and Communists in Italy, as a first step toward improving relations and eventually establishing diplomatic relations between Moscow and the Holy See.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few weeks went by, A little more cold air was needed, and it came from the Associated Press in a Rome (not Vatican City) dispatch. It is so silly as to be incredible, but here it is, from the Cleveland </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> of July 24, 1944:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pope Hits Catholic Communist Party. Rome (AP)--Pope Pius XII today had renewed the church’s condemnation of Italy’s Catholic Communist party, already forcefully expressed Saturday by the Vatican ’ organ, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other words, the Vatican is always able to present complete evidence that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">it has been on both sides of every sub. ject, and that nothing that it says on any subject is worthy of the least credence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the final chill wind came five days later in a dispatch from New York to the . Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font7"> in which the Jesuit “Reverend Father” John La Farge is quoted as scolding Russia for asking the Vatican to publicly drop the Nazis </span><span class="font5">at the very time when the hand of friendship is most evident between the pope and the Allied troops now in Rome, at a moment when, for the first time in history, Communists have been admitted to direct audience with the pope, and a Communist premier confers with the Papal acting secretary of state.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Monastery Life a Mistake</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HE press in this country has recently focused attention on the Cistercian monastery of Mount Saint Bernard, in the picturesque and* hilly district of Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire. In 1835 a party of six monks from Ireland took possession of a little cottage, and were later assisted by the owner of the manor of Grace Dien, who bought an adjoining estate on their behalf. There an abbey was built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This year new buildings, built from ■ stone quarried on the grounds, have been formally opened. It is these proceedings that have been given such prominence by the press and radio. The buildings were subsequently thrown open for inspection by the general public. Because of the publicity given, and . of the recent increase in the petrol (gasoline) ration, the public went in their thousands, the roads around the monastery being chockablock with cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two booklets, on sale at the abbey, ■ have come into my possession. One is entitled “The English Cistercians”, and the other “What Is a Monk?” From these one learns that this particular monastery is the only Cistercian or Trappist mon-.astery in Britain. The Cistercians are sometimes known as “The Silent Monks”. Concerning this practice of silence, one of the brochures says. “Despite the Protestant notion, Cistercians do not take a vow of silence. It may be admitted that their silence is sufficient to impress the general public. In actual practice the . silence observed in a monastery is nei-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">' JANUARY 2, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font7">ther depressing nor unsociable. It would be a safe thing to say that there is more happiness and mutual tolerance in any group of monks than could be found in an equal number of business men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must certainly come as a relief to any normal, sane person to realize that the self-imposed silence is not absolute, but merely relative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ong also learns from the same source that in the winter months the monks rise at 2 a.m., and retire at 7 p.m,, with a slight alteration in the summer.<sup>1</sup> Part of the day is spent in chanting, celebrating mass, etc.; and the rest of the time in farm work, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But what the writer of this article was particularly desirous of ascertaining was how the monks, while professing to be such devout Christians, attempted to justify their peculiar hermit form of life. And this is how they seek to do so. The following “reasoning” is set forth in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Is a Monk?: ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although Christ’s life is too rich for one man to be able to imitate it in every detail, the whole Mystical Body can follow His Divine example. Few could spend the whole night in prayer and then spend the whole day preaching the Kingdom of God, but it is possible for some members to concentrate chiefly upon imitation of the teaching life, and for others to concentrate rather upon the praying life, etc. Monks are called by God to specialize in public worship, and to deputize for those whose activities involve more direct contact with their fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What fallacious reasoning! What </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mis</span><span class="font7"></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">guided sophistry I The Master never admonished any of His followers to become hermits, or to spend their time in prayer to the exclusion of preaching the gospel. *On the contrary, were not His admonitions to unremitting activity in the publication of the Kingdom news I Did He 1 not send forth first the apostles, arid * later tfie seventy disciples, not to withdraw from the world, but to preach the gospel? Moreover, wen; not His words,, after His resurrection, &quot;Go ... and make disciples of all the nations”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Where, also, in that record of apostolic ministry known as the Acts of the Apostles, is there any account of the apostles as permanently retiring from the world? To the contrary, does not the apostle Paul urge believers to vocal activity, saying, “Preach the Word; be instant in season, out of season”? What a delusion, then, is this anachronistic monastic life, with its fallacious claim to holy living! But, in the words of the Master, “Let the dead bury their dead.” —Contributed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Do You Love Your Children? *</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font7">ARENTS have a sweet privilege and a great responsibility toward the little ones that have come to make their homes with them in the most formative years of life. Love occupies a great place in the universe, and eventually, when God’s footstool is made glorious, it will be everywhere. Meantime, here is a preliminary statement about it, from Funk &amp;&nbsp;Wagnalls’ dictionary:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, Love is the yearning or outgoing of soul toward something that is regarded as excellent, beautiful or desirable; love may be briefly defined as strong and absorbing affection for and attraction toward a person or object. Love may denote the sublimest and holiest spiritual affection, as when we are taught that “God is love”. . . . Love is more intense, absorbing, and tender than friendship, more intense, impulsive, and perhaps passionate than affection; we speak of fervent love, but of deep or tender affection, or of close, firm, strong friendship. Love is used specifically for personal affection between the sexes in the highest sense, and love that normally leads to marriage, and subsists throughout all happy wedded life. Love can never properly denote mere animal passion, which is expressed by such words as appetite, desire, lust. One may properly be said to have love for animals, for inanimate objects, or for abstract qualities that enlist the affections, as we speak of love for a horse or a dog, for mountains, woods, ocean, or of love of nature, and love of virtue. Love of articles of food is better expressed by liking, as love, in its full sense, expresses something spiritual and reciprocal, such as. can have no place in connection with objects that minister merely to the senses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing has a lot .of information, and a lot of common sense packed into a single paragraph, but love has been briefly defined according to the Scriptures as being “the perfect expression of unselfishness”. The Scriptures, which are the Word of God, the God of love itself, go into details on the subject, and are a joy and rejoicing to the hearts of all that love righteousness. Here are texts: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owe nobody anything—except the duty of mutual love. . . . “You must love your neighbor as you do yourself.” Love never wrongs a neighbor.—Romans 13:8-10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your love must be genuine. You must hate what is wrong, and hold to what is right. Be affectionate in your love for the brotherhood, eager to show one another honor, not wanting in devotion, but on fire with the spirit. Serve the Lord. Be happy in your hope, steadfast in time of trouble, persistent in prayer. Supply the needs of God’s people, be unfailing in hospitality. Bless your persecutors; bless them; do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be too ambitious, but accept humble tasks. Do not be conceited. Do not pay anyone back with evil for evil. See that you are above reproach in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' the eyes ,of everyone.—Romans 12:9-17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If I can speak the languages of men and <sup>1</sup> even of angels, but have no love, I am only a noisy gong or a clashing cymbal. If I am inspired to preach and know all the secret truths and possess all knowledge, and if I have such perfect faith that I can move mountains, but have no love, I am nothing. Even if I give away everything I own, and give myself up, but do it in pride, not love, it does me no good. Love is patient and kind. Love is not envious or boastful. It does not put on airs. It is not rude. It does not insist on its rights. It does not become angry. It is not resentful. It is not happy over injustice, it is only happy with truth. It will bear anything, believe anything, hope for anything, endure anything. Love will never die out.—1 Corinthians 13:1-8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Do You Love the Little Folks?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. If so, help them learn of the Kingdom. And while you are helping them you will be helping yourself:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Love is consistent. It is not one thing . today and something else tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Parents should never forget the solemn truth that &quot;Jehovah preserves all those who love him” nor that it is a blessed and holy duty and privilege to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of Jehovah, so that the little folks may pass through Armageddon without harm and come over into the New World, there to live with Jehovah (in the place of His feet), and to love Him, and to walk with Him and to rejoice before Him for ever and for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Notice, all you fathers and mothers that love God, and wish to be in His kingdom! You must not forget the great truth that your children belong not to -you but to Jehovah. See what He says:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Don’t think that the Lord will forget anything:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Isaac Newton, Scientist, Bible Student</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">saac Newton was born at' Colster-worth, Lincolnshire, December 25, 1642. In. that year civil war broke out between Parliament and Charles I, son of James I. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Consolation</span><span class="font7"> No. 685) It was I likewise the year in which the great astronomer Galileo died. Newton himself was to become one of the greatest of natural scientists &quot;and mathematicians the world had known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isaac was so small at his birth that he could, it was said, liave been put into a quart mug.’ He outgrew <sup>z</sup>this handicap, however, and early showed great promise in the study of mathematics and , mechanics. He was at first not much interested in his school work, but an injustice done him by a fellow pupil spurred him on to better effort, with the result that he became the leading pupil in the school. Isaac showed very little interest in the games and sports of childhood. He was interested in mechanical things, such as windmills, water clocks, kites, &quot;dials, and similar devices, Many of these he constructed himself. As he advanced he showed special ability in the field of mathematics. He learned the most difficult lessons with ease. While still young he discovered the law of gravitation, seeing an apple fall from a tree and asking himself, “What makes It fall </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">down?*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides his interest in the marvels of nature, which became more profound as he grew older, Isaac manifested a deep reverence for God and sincere earnestness in the study of the Scriptures, to which he devoted as much intelligent scrutiny as he applied to his other studies. He lived at a time when the Bible and its truths were under constant discussion, and the writings of the greatest - poet England has known, John Milton, were current and undoubtedly contributed to his love for and interest in the Scriptures. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isaac Newton produced a number of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">books dealing with Scripture himself, and it is with these that we are here chiefly concerned, even though it was his scientific knowledge and attainments that won him his title, so that he might <sub>t </sub>be called Sir Isaac Newton. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Among</span><span class="font7"> other Scriptural subjects, Sir Isaac devoted close attention to the chronology of the Bible. He wrote a carefully prepared treatise on<sup>1</sup> the subject, and, as a token of his respect, presented it to the princess of Wales. By some means a copy of the treatise was obtained, by a Catholic abbe, Conti, who published it in Paris, without the leave of its author! But Newton made it clear that the “Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms” was his work. It was a very fine piece of work, particularly when the times in which he wrote it are taken into consideration. A writer says of this work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is astonishing what care and industry Newton employed about the papers relating to chronology, church history, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daniel and the Revelation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newton was also intrigued by the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, &quot;which both contain time features. He realized that neither of these books could be understood until at least in course of fulfillment. Concerning Revelation he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a part of this prophecy that it should not be understood before .the last age of the world ; and, therefore,,it makes for the credit of the prophecy, that if is not yet understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He also remarked; ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having determined the time of writing the Apocalypse, I need not say much about the truth of it . . . all true Christians in that early age received this prophecy; for in all ages, as many as believe the thousand years, received the Apocalypse [Revelation] as the foundation of their opinion: and I do not know one instance to the contrary. Papi as [see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> No. 641], Bishop of Hier-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">apolis, a man of the Apostolic age, and one of John’s own disciples, did not only teach the doctrine of the thousand years, but also as* sorted the Apocalypse as written by divine in* * spiration. .. . Daniel and John [in the Revelation] should not be understood till the time of the end: but then some should prophesy out of them in an afflicted and mournful state for a long time, and that but darkly, so as to convert but few. But in the very end, the prophecy should be so far interpreted as to convince many. “Then,” saith Daniel, “many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be <sub>;</sub> increased.” For the Gospel must be preached in all nations before the great tribulation, and end of the world. The palm-bearing multitude, which come out of this great tribulation, cannot be innumerable out of all nations, unless they be made so by the preaching of the Gospel before it comes. There must be a stone cut out of a mountain without hands, before it can fall upon the toes of the image, and become a great mountain, and fill the earth . . . the many and clear prophecies concerning the things to be done at Christ’s second coming, are not only for predicting, but also for effecting a recovery and re-establishment of the long-lost truth, and setting up a kingdom wherein dwells righteousness. . . . the time is not yet come for understanding them perfectly, because the main revolution predicted in them is not yet come to pass. ‘Tn the days <sub>L</sub>of the voice of the seventh angel, when he ' shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall .' be finished, as be hath declared to his servants the prophets<sub>;</sub> and then the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ, and he shall reign for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Newton Was Honest</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newton was honest enough to see that this bright hope was the theme of the Scriptures, and not the doleful prospect of being saved from eternal torment in which the majority of the human family would suffer for all eternity. Because of the interest he took in God’s Word, puny men brought Satan’s favorite charge against sincere Christians to bear upon Newton: he was &quot;mentally unbalanced’!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being an honest man, Newton also saw that the “trinity” doctrine as taught by the Church of Rome and others was thoroughly unscriptural. He was accused of being an Arian, an accusation which has been laid against almost all the honest and conscientious students of God’s precious Word. Newton published a work entitled “Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture”, and showed that neither 1. Timothy 3:16 nor 1 John 5:7, as contained in the most authentic manuscripts, supported the idea that Jesus and God and the holy spirit were the same yet different, that they were three, yet one, that they were equal in power and glory and eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What Newton discovered some two hundred years ago was acknowledged to be true as to these two texts by the learned men who revised the King James Version of the Bible in 1881. As to 1 Timothy 3:16, the revisers translate it, correctly, “He who was manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up in glory.” In a footnote we read, “The word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God,</span><span class="font7"> in place of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He who,</span><span class="font7"> rests on no sufficient ancient evidence. Some ancient authorities read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ivhich.'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning 1 John 5: 7, it is admitted to be an interpolation, and correctly reads: “And it is the spirit that beareth witness, because the spirit is the truth. For there are three who bear witness, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.”—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is significant that Milton, in a posthumous book, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">On Christian Doctrine,</span><span class="font7"> set forth the same conclusion at which Sir Isaac Newton later also arrived, that nothing in Scripture warrants the Trinitarian exaltation of Christ Jesus to equality with Jehovah God, but he believed what the Scriptures so simply and convincingly set forth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font7"> Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.” (Jesus’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'n-• \ . ■ <sub>s</sub>. • ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">own words, at John 17: 3) “To us there is, but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord JeSus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.” (1 Corinthians 8: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">6) </span><span class="font7">&quot;[Christ] who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.” (Colossians 1:15) “These things saith the Amen [Christ], the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.”—Revelation 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of Milton it was said that his &quot;theology” was &quot;peculiar, heterodox” and &quot;Arian”. But it is admitted of him that &quot;no man had a higher opinion of [the Bible’s] supreme authority, or held more firmly its most vital truths”. The same may be said of the noble Sir Isaac Newton, who gave his mighty witness to the wisdom and power of God in nature, and also testified to that wisdom and power as shown in the Scriptures. Scoffers sneer at Newton’s reverence for the Bible, but they cannot deny his mighty genius any more than they can ignore the law of gravitation which he discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newton died March 20, 1727. His remains were given place in Westminster Abbey. A magnificent monument was erected to his memory with the inscription, in Latin, “Let mortals congratulate themselves that so great an ornament of human nature has existed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">F</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ranklin D. Roosevelt died on April, 12. In its next day’s issue the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> disclosed that the pope had just recently &quot;conveyed his blessings” and asked that Mr. Roosevelt be told, “I am praying for him and especially for his health.” The moral seems to . be that if you are not feeling well, just get the pope to pray for you and that will finish the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems, from studies extending over centuries, that the prayers of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy operate in reverse. If they pray for a cause<sup>1</sup> that cause is simply out of luck. One of the latest illustrations had to do with the extremely over advertised Notre Dame football team. The team came on to New York to play the Army, but first they went to the Fort Montgomery Blessed Sacrament chapel, where the “Reverend” J. Charles McCarragher gave &quot;communion”, so called, to the players whom he had accompanied east. Pictures of the communion were distributed all over the country. They appeared in the Wilkes-Barre </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font7"> on the same day that the game was played.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would have made a big hit if the Notre Dame had come out on top. Many </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 2, 1946</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">would have looked upon it as evidence of the blessing of high heaven on the Roman Catholic players. But what happened at the game was that the Army beat Notre Dame to the tune of forty-eight to nothing. Alas, publicity wasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20) &quot;He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.” (Proverbs 28: 9) ‘&quot;The wise men are ashamed . . . dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord [Jehovah]; and what wisdom is in them?”-Jeremiah 8:9.</span></p>
