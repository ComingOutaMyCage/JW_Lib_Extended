<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Devil Back of the Blanchette</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ To us here in England it is a great privilege and blessing from the Almighty God to receive the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font7">again. One small article in the August If), 1945, issue attracted my attention as soon as I opened it. Tt was the account of the two young girls who were worried about the planchette board. I could not help thinking, “Poor little things!” for’ as I entered maidenhood my attention was drawn to similar things, and I well remember the mental struggles </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">-had because thereof. I recall one evening, at the home of a “Salvationist”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' all the time we were using the thing, I kept looking back to see who was there. I know now who it was !</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The best advice 1 can give js to put the whole trouble before the Lord, and remember that the Devil is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">always, all</span><span class="font7"> the time, trying to entrap and ensnare those who arc trying to walk in the way of the Lord and who show a tendency to bless His name.—From one who hopes for a -place in the New World of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Storm Brought Back Her Hearing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ It was at Hammond, Ind. Mrs. Ignatz Spogis had been deaf for three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ It was summer. A thunder shower came up while she was sitting on her porch. Her home was struck by lightning; but no harm was done, apparently, for when the storm had passed Mrs. Spogis found that she could hear a watch tick. Her hearing had returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese Permitted to Commit Idolatry</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In the year 193S the pope gave permission to Japanese Catholics to bow in worship before the emperor, who then claimed to be of divine origin. This was done in spite of the fact that, according to the ex-priest L. H. Lehman, any such thing had been forbidden for centuries by Roman Catholic doctrine.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XXVII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y,, Wednesday, March 13, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 691</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Fight for Freedom in Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HE history of Italy is one of suffering and misery. It is the record of an oppressed people trying to free themselves from the fetters of bondage and gain a measure of the liberty enjoyed by other nations. Today, as the struggle continues, it is manifest that Italy needs a strong centralized power that will lead its people in their fight for freedom. Many, no doubt, will point to pope Pius XII as the man of the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speaking to the College of Cardinals on the eve of the first postwar Christmas this spiritual leader of 92.12 percent of Italy’s population said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">State totalitarianism is incompatible with a true and healthy democracy. Like a dangerous germ it infects the community of nations and renders it incapable of guaranteeing the security of individual peoples. It constitutes a continual menace of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The future peace structure aims at outlawing from the world every aggressive use of force, every war of aggression. Who could not greet such an intention enthusiastically, especially in its effective realization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But if this is to be something more than a beautiful gesture, all oppression and all arbitrary action from within and without must be banned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is there not found here a man who will fight for “true and healthy democracy” for Italy? One who will root out the “dangerous germ” of totalitarianism that is a “menace of war” to the nation ? Is there not found in Pius XII a champion of liberty who will fight for freedom in Italy and destroy “all oppression and all arbitrary action from within and without”? Is this not the man with the necessary determination, ability and power to pull Italy out of the fascist swamp ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman empire was not built by the passionate speech-making of some Caesar or Mark Antony. Neither should we be hasty in concluding that a Utopia of blessed liberty in Italy will be ushered in because the pontiff of Vatican City has thus spoken. The prudent and wise thing would be to first examine this statement of the pope in the revealing light of former encyclicals and measure it by the record and history of the organization which he heads. Only then shall we be able to assay the merits of the claim that this “strong man” and his organization are courageous and gallant fighters for freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take down the history books, and, after brushing off the accumulated dust of several centuries, open them up to the year 800 (A.D.). There it is recorded that Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne emperor of the “Holy Roman Empire” on Christmas Day in the city of Rome. That was the beginning of a thousand-year reign of church and state, which period is spoken of as the “most glorious” in the history of the Church, when the pope of Rome ruled with supreme authority. Never was there a more splendid opportunity afforded the Church to demonstrate its reputed virtues as the defender and protector of the cause of freedom for the common man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet, what do we find recorded in this history from the ninth century onward? Is it a story of.the Church educating the masses of people to read and write so</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">that they could publish and circulate their opinions among fellow creatures? Does it tell of the people’s freedom to . speak and express their opinions openly in public? Or does it describe how the people enjoyed the fundamental freedom , to worship according to the dictates of t their conscience ? a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bloody Record of Oppression</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No, the account lacks any description of such,freedom and liberty being grant-, ed by the Church of Rome. Instead, our eyes are blurred by the criminal record of a pornocracy when reprobates occupied the papal throne. Down a dark and slip-eroad we are taken into an abyss of an slime and suffering that beggars description. But stop! We can read no farther. We are up to the period of the Inquisition and the pages of this chronicle have turned a scarlet red, red with the blood of millions of poor innocent .ones that became the victims of a cruel, beastly and ruthless totalitarian system of oppression. Indeed, the whole history of church and state is that of an iron rule. There was no freedom of education; no freedom of publication and circulation; no freedom to read and study the Bible and worship God as He commanded- The rule and rage of the Church was as unmerciful and cruel against those who held opinions differing from her own as any modern totalitarian regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It may be argued that the evils of that infamous period of wedlock arose from submission of the Chureh to the temporal power. An examination of the encyclicals and pronouncements of the Church, and the doctrines and teachings of her clergy, will readily disclose whether it was the ■ temporal power that suppressed freedom or whether it was the Roman Catholic Hierarchy themselves. Such background or declarations of the Hierarchy will also permit us to see whether the pope of Rome is today qualified to champion freedom’s cause for the Italian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The &quot;infallible” popes, Alexander VII, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Clement VIII, Benedict XIV, Pius VI, Pius VII, Leo XII, Pius VIII, Gregory XVI, and Pius IX, all prescribed rules and issued injunctions against freedom of the press. The famous Syllabus of Pius IX issued pecember 8, 1864, constituted an abstract of or reassertion of all the claims of the papacy of medieval time's. That Syllabus contained condemnations against 80 current doctrines'of the day, claiming that they were heresy. Numbers 45-48 denounced secular education. Number 79 condemned freedom of the press. And Number 77 was directed against liberty of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cardinal Pecci, who later became Pope Leo XIII, in 1878, deplored the ‘licentiousness of the theater and the press, and the continual snares laid to surprise pious souls, to undermint’ faith by circulating infamous pamphlets and heterodox writings”. That was not a denouncement of obscene literature, but rather was a railing against writings of Protestant organizations that endeavored to enlighten the people on the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continuing, Pecci says, “Nor is it left to the free will of man to refuse it, or to fashion for himself a form of worship and service such as he pleases to render;” And again he wrote that it was impious and monstrous to think that “the human conscience is free to adopt whichever form it pleases, and to fashion out a religion to suit itself”. By thus expressing himself against freedom of the press, worship and conscience Pecci took his stand with his predecessors and showed that he was triply qualified to become a pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While denouncing the free use of the press as a. vehicle for publishing the truth the Hierarchy itself uses the press to spread propaganda in an effort to suppress the truth. As an example, Lord Robert Montagu, at one time Catholic member -of Parliament, published a 428-page book entitled “Popular Errors Concerning Politics and Religion”. This book had the Hierarchy’s approbation; on every page is found the Jesuit stamp. To</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">quote only a few lines:“The pope can not sanction mdifferentism or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">liberty of worship',</span><span class="font7"> nor </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">civil marriages,</span><span class="font7"> nor </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">secular education;</span><span class="font7"> he can not concede </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">liberty, or rather license, of the press;</span><span class="font7"> nor recognize </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sovereignty of the people;</span><span class="font7"> nor admit the necessity of the 'social evil’; nor legalize robbery and murder.” Here is a monstrous claim by a papist that democratic principles of freedom of worship, freedom of the press and sovereignty of the people are crimes as great as robbery and murder. Does anyone honestly think that an organization that has taken such a position in the past can be trusted to establish democratic freedom in Italy today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Richard W. Thompson, one-time secretary of the United States Navy, after carefully considering this subject in his book, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Footprints of the Jesuits,</span><span class="font7"> asks some very pointed questions: When “did religious toleration exist in Rome? What pope ever gave it the sanction of a papal decree, or recognized Protestantism as worthy of anything higher than his fiercest anathemas? Let the millions of persecuted victims of pontifical and inquisitorial vengeance, Albigenses, Wal-denses, Huguenots, and'Netherlanders, answer from their graves”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Vatican’s Secret Weapon</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The greatest progress toward the establishment of free democratic institutions has been made in Italy since 1870. In that year, on September 20, liberal forces, in launching an attack on Vatican City, wrested from the pope the temporal rule of Italy and put the religious power in its proper place. Following this triumph great strides were made in education of the people, and with education in reading and writing came liberties in addition to the.freedoms of breathing and thinking (freedoms “granted” even when the Church ruled). In other words, the people were now allowed freedom of action to express their thoughts to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But such new-born liberty was destined for a short life. The papal technicians got-busy and designed a new weapon to use against Italy’s youthful freedoms, a secret weapon, which has become known as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism.</span><span class="font7"> At first many were deceived by its apparent anti-cleric shape. This made it possible to utilize the power of the radical element to launch Fascism. Once started, however, the momentum was accelerated by the Vatican forces concealed within, and as a result the Hierarchy was rocketed to a new height in world affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Mussolini made his coup d’etat at Rome October 30, 1922, no one would have ventured the opinion that Fascism was merely a new hood on an old wolf. Not until it opened its mouth to devour civil rights were the old Vatican fangs visible. Among the first victims swallowed by this beast were the Freemasons. Says </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font7"> “The suppression of Freemasonry in Italy by Mussolini was regarded as a move to gain favor with the Church, which had long been at war with secret societies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It became very manifest, as time went on, that this totalitarian rule was merely a revival of the church and state reign of the Dark Ages. The Report of the Foreign Policy Association, January 15, 1944, in showing the “very evident similarity of form between the authoritarian church and the totalitarian government”, continues and says,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fascist government of Italy, in fact, carefully cultivated this resemblance and flattered the Church by copying its externals rather closely. The device by whieh the Fascist Grand Council was to select a successor to the Duce bears some resemblance to that whereby the College of Cardinals elects a pope. The pattern of the corporative state borrowed heavily from the guild-like institutions suggested in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rerum Novarum,</span><span class="font5"> and' Pius XI was prompt to acknowledge as much in his own encyclical </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Quadragesima Anno.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also in the matter of religion, the doctrine of the totalitarian state is basically the same as that of the Catholic Church. This statement may seem startling at first, but a careful study will show that in both the true worship' of God is replaced by a worship of the state, on the one hand or on the other, a worship of creatures, Pius XII in his encyclical letter, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Summi Pontificatus</span><span class="font7"> of 1939, calls attention to the religion of the state:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once the authority of God and the sway of His law are denied in this way, the civil au-i thority as an inevitable result tends to attribute to itself that absolute autonomy which belongs exclusively to the Supreme Maker. It puts itself in the place of the Almighty and elevates the state or group into the last end of life, the supreme criterion of the moral and juridical order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But is such religion of the state any different in design from that of the Vatican ? In a spiritual sense the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have done exactly what they accuse the state, of doing, namely, exalting and placing itself in the position and stead of God. In doing so it has become the “man of sin, the son of perdition” mentioned by the apostle Paul: “Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.”—2 Thessalonians 2:3,4, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, then, in many different aspects it is seen that the Fascist totalitarian rule was very similar to the Catholic authoritarian system. Both were modeled after the same pattern, cast in the same die, hewn from the same tree; perhaps by the hands of the same Jesuit craftsmen. Both are harsh, cruel, oppressive of human rights, and intolerant of all opinion, belief and thought other than their own brand. Both crush out the basic principles of human rights, namely, freedom of speech, press and worship.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1929 Concordat with Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having such a close resemblance in structure, and parallelism in purpose, it was not surprising that Fascism and Vaticanism sought to join forces in a formal pact. Senor Farinacci, secretary general of the Fascist Party in 1926, speaking of Mussolini, said: “He cherishes the ambition to arrive at an amicable compromise with the pope on the Roman question in return for the moral support of the Vatican for his own foreign and internal policies in general and his Imperialistic programme in particular.” Such ambition was crystalized on February 10, 1929, with the signing of the concordat known as the Lateran Treaty. Thereby all doubt was dispelled and it was clearly<sup>7</sup> seen that Fascism was a scheme launched by the Hierarchy to win back ground they had lost to the common people in the way of freedom and liberty. This new magnetic force became known the world over as the southern pole of a totalitarian Axis around which it was hoped the whole world would be forced to rotate. (Mention may here be made that Mussolini received the pope's blessing!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The concordat resembles others of its kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It recognizes the position of the Church and the rights of the clergy, defines ecclesiastical jurisdiction, provides for state approval of new bishops, recognizes the validity of religious marriage, provides for religious instruction in state schools “according to a program to be agreed upon”, and recognizes Catholic Action, the body of Catholic youth organizations, provided these organizations’ take no part in polities. Article 43, for example, states that Italy “recognizes the auxiliary organizations of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Azione Cattolica Italiana</span><span class="font5"> inasmuch as these, according to the regulations of the Holy See, carry on their activities independently of all political parties and under -the immediate direction of the Hierarchy of the Church for teaching and practice of Catholic principles.” (Foreign Policy Report, January 15, 1944)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let none be deceived by the stipulation that Catholic Action organizations were to take no part in politics. Such Action groups were like similar groups in other countries; they “were under the immediate direction of the Hierarchy” and needed no political name to enable them to apply pressure wheresoever the Vatican directed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Suppression of the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses, observing the rise of the totalitarian monster in Italy, appreciated hqw helpless the people were to free themselves from the fetters that so tightly hound them. If such humble ones were to be aided, then help would have to come from an outside source. So in 1932 Jehovah’s witnesses living in the neighboring country of Switzerland printed, a large supply of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World. </span><span class="font7">Twenty brethren from Switzerland traveling at the expense of the Watchtower Society went into the principal cities of Italy to distribute these booklets to the truth-hungry people, with the following results:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some cities the police gave verbal permission to proceed with the work, and within ten days 300,000 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font5"> booklet had been distributed. In the middle of the week the enemy was aroused, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">upon the order from Rome</span><span class="font5"> the permission to'distribute was withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was all right with the local officers, who, for the most part, were individuals sympathetic toward the needs of the common man. But “when Rome speaks” all free announcement of the truth must cease 1 The Vatican cannot stand to have the people enlightened about God’s blessed kingdom. Nothing infuriates those Pharisaical rulers more than to tell the people that the Theocratic Government is the only hope for suffering mankind. So, as soon as word filtered through that Jehovah’s peace messengers were in Italy, immediately an alarm was sent out and the work had to cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems like a small thing, the distribution of 300,000 booklets among the vast population of Italy, yet such seeds took root and bore fruit and many who were freed from the bondage of religion began telling others the truth. As to be expected, all such activity met with violent persecution at the hands of the truth-haters. Quoting from the 1936-</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt the Vatican and Mussolini are in full accord and have a clear understand- ■ * ing as to the operations of both. Because </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">this combined opposition it is impossible to conduct a regular work of publishing the , Kingdom message within the borders of Italy. Only two brethren have been able to do any work in that country during the year, and they have^worked under great difficulties. Often the literature is taken away from them and they are thrown into prison. One pioneer was shot dead. The Catholic Hierarchy even manifested its venom toward the Lord’s people in interfering with the decent burial of this pioneer, who was witnessing for the Kingdom....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clergy prevented the corpse of this brother from being taken to the funeral rooms* the body being left in an old shed without proper attention. People, upon hearing of this outrageous treatment, were incensed, and this furnished an opportunity to give them a witness to the truth. Because the deceased had relatives in that neighborhood, they were outlawed by the clergy and were threatened by . fire and brimstone because they had given shelter to a “heretic”, thus showing the same infamous spirit as shown in the early days </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Italy, when the Inquisition was at its height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One brother still operating in Italy is able to give out some literature. Often the literature sent to him, however, never reaches him, ’ being confiscated by officials under the direction of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A late report tells how the tight for freedom in Italy increased in fury during the war. In 1939 the Vatican-Fascist gang made a special raid on the homes of Jehovah’s witnesses in an effort to silence these truth-tellers once and for all. More than 1.50 men and-women were arrested, twenty-six of whom were given severe sentences ranging all the way from five years’ imprisonment up to the death sentence. Among the seven charges leveled against these Christians, which “crimes” were adjudged worthy of death, was this one: “e) Charged with the crime referred to in article 8 of the Treaty of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Italy' ’with the Holy See, in relation to .article 278 C.P., for having publicly and by means of the printed page offended the sovereign pontiff.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>t</sub> Remember, this incident did not hap-'pen in the Dark Ages or in the nineteenth century. It did not occur under</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sub>K</sub> the direction of former popes whd have , 1‘ long since died. It has happened in<sub>;</sub> our * day and age; it has happened since -Pacelli was crowned Pope Pius XII in 1939. Unbelievable! you say, that in this twentieth century one is considered worthy of death who proclaims the truth as contained in the Bible. But remember all such things are possible in a country dominated by a religio-political Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Hierarchy Loved Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* Some will contend that the Catholic Hierarchy supported Fascism in the beginning on the grounds that it could be used as an instrument to establish unity in Italy and settle the Roman question to the satisfaction, of all. But did the Vatican withdraw its support and fight against Fascism when it became openly manifest that such was only a cruel, wicked totalitarian rule that ruthlessly disregarded the rights of men?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Article 20 of the 1929 concordat required the bishops to swear an oath of allegiance and fidelity into the hand of the Fascists. This oath was never repudiated, but was continued in force up to the very last. Moreover, the Hierarchy went farther and signed concordats with Hitler in 1933, and with bloody Franco in 1941, both of which required the bishops to give an oath of allegiance similar to the one sworn to Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. If the Vatican was looking for an opening to withdraw its support of totalitarianism in favor of democratic principles of freedom and liberty for the common people, then there was no better opportunity afforded than the Ethiopian war. However, Professor Gffitano Salvemini, in his publication </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">No Friend of Democracy,</span><span class="font7"> lists 7 cardinal archbishops, 23 archbishops, and 44 bishops, all of the Italian Catholic Hierarchy in addition to the pope, who supported Fascism and were in favor of the wanton rape of helpless Ethiopia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Says the Foreign Policy Report (January 15,1944), “The invasion of Ethiopia, far from driving the two ^powers apart, actually improved their relations and demonstrated to an astonished world how far the Church would follow Mussolini in his expansionist policy.” Continuing, that article further says, ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When all was over the pope in his address to the world exhibition of the Catholic press (May 12, 1936) referred to &quot;the triumphant joy of a great and good people” over the conclusion of the peace, thus dispelling all possible doubt of where his real feelings lay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">World domination was the ambition of both the Vatican and Fascism; together ■ they thought to obtain it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Neither was the support of the Fascists limited to the clergy of Italy. The members of the Hierarchy in the so-called “democratic lands” also were outspoken in expressing their approval and praise of Mussolini’s program so destructive of human rights. Cardinal Hayes, of New York, and Cardinal Dougherty, of Philadelphia, both spoke in favor of Fascism in Italy when it was at the height of its glory. The late Cardinal O’Connell, of Boston, said, “Italy was in process of undergoing a marvelous transformation since Benito Mussolini had seized the reins of government ... I see perfect order, cleanliness, work, industrial development.” Also Archbishop Hinsley, of England, who was created a cardinal in 1937, was reported to have said about Italy, &quot;If Fascism goes under nothing can save the country from Chaos: God’s cause goes with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus is shown the love and devotion of the Vatican!tes for Fascism when it was on the verge of gaining world domination. Only when its glory began to . wane did the Hierarchy diplomats appear on the scene to condemn it. The world in general may have been fooled with this adroit move, but Italians who had lived close to the scene were not deceived by this change of policy on the part of the Vatican Fascists. Mr. Hayden, a close assistant to the president of the Foreign Policy Association, in commenting on this, says: “Critics both friendly and hostile have forecast a period of unprecedented anti-clericalism in Italy, believing that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the long association of the Vatican with fascism</span><span class="font7"> will reap its harvest of hatred and even of persecution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Italy may not be informed on the historical record of persecution made by the Catholic Church, due to the Fascist educational system, but Italians do have a firsthand knowledge of the last twenty years and its heart-breaking events. And as these people continue their struggle for freedom they will not forget the long and intimate association of the Hierarchy with Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The 1943 Break for Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ Suddenly there was a change in the whole picture. No longer do we see the Fascist! standing in the Piazza Venezia shouting </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Viva II Duce.</span><span class="font7"> Mussolini himself has passed out of the picture. Fascism has cracked up. An armistice has been signed between the acting Italian government and the Allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among other things the surrender terms contained some very important provisions in favor of the freedoms expressed in the Atlantic Charter. “All Fascist organizations and the secret police will be disbanded, all laws discriminating against persons on grounds of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">race, creed, color</span><span class="font7"> or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">political opinions </span><span class="font7">will be rescinded and those persons held for punishment under such laws will be released.” (From A,F.H.Q. Commentary, .New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> November 7, 1945) Like a beacon light of freedom such “Bill erf Rights” appeared to throw its beam down a new road of opportunity for the buffering people of Italy to gain their long-desired liberty. But when we look up from reading this important document and face the realities that exist in Italy itself our eyes are confronted with a different picture, one of confusion, to say the least. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are at least six political parties in Italy each having a different formula on how to run the government. These six parties are grouped into two general divisions, which, for the want of a better name, are called “Right” and “Left”. The right wing is composed of the “Christian Democrats”, Liberals and Labor Democrats, while the left wing is made up of Communists, Socialists and Actionists. If it w<sup>r</sup>ere only a matter of choosing between these two divisions it would be comparatively simple, but instead there are at least six contenders for the honor of controlling the government and the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All such are antagonistic toward each other and are willing to make concessions only as they see in the move an opportunity to gain an advantage for their own interests in the end. So, at times they hang together in a somewhat disjointed fashion in the form of a coalition government, while at other times they are in open rebellion among themselves. When one side is charged witli containing the “germ of fascism” it immediately makes the counter-charge that fascism exists in the ranks of its opponents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Politically speaking, Italy is very sensitive and unstable; the least spark is liable to cause a conflagration. Already five cabinets have fallen, and the sixth one is none too firm in the saddle, for it will automatically be dissolved when the promised election materializes. Signor Parri, when resigning as premier of Italy, warned that an undercurrent of fascism was tugging just below the surface. He passionately cried out: “Now that I am leaving office I must warn my successors to beware of civil war.” (New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font7"> November 25, 1945) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, when a bomb explodes outside ' the Communist headquarters the charge is made that it was caused by the Fascists. But more disturbing than the ex' plosion of bombs are the repercussions caused by Guglielmo Giannini’s weekly publication, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I'Vomo Qualunque</span><span class="font7"> (“Com<sub>r</sub> mon Man”).Milton Bracker has described ^Giannini as an admitted ex-Fascist and mas pointed out that although he has blamed Mussolini for strategic mistakes yet he has never criticized his general policy. Most of the readers of his paper, which number around 800,000, although not active Fascists, make up the potential bloc for neo-Fascism. Notwithstanding Giannini’s claipis of “democracy” he predicts that his movement will spread “all over the world” and when once his men gain control of Italy they will remain in office for twenty years, and their government will not be called Fascism but will be given a “new name”. One has only to recall the boasting of Benito when he aspired to dominate the world to see the similarity between the two. Little wonder that reference was made in the House of Commons to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I’Uomo </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Qualunque</span><span class="font7"> as “Fascist or neo-Fascist”. Says the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> “More and more Italians were asking whether there was not someone behind Signor Giannini, and if so, who.” For the answer they should take their eyes off this dark figure and look at “St. Peter’s” dome in Vatican City, which casts its fascist shadow over the land. Indeed, those who hate fascism and all that it represents are up against a formidable foe in their fight for freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Hierarchy Campaigns for Votes</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fascist interests of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are too much at stake for them to remain passive toward the political struggle that is now going on in Italy. So we see the Vatican right in the middle of the swirl of six political parties with all claws flying. Not only does she openly support the “Christian Democrat” Party, to which Dr. Alcide de Gasperi acting as both premier and foreign minister belongs, but also the Vatican exercises her power in other ways. For example, the bishops in the Vento region sent out a letter entitled “Catho- ■ lies’ Duties to Face Present Dangers” to be read in all the churches. An AP dispatch says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The letter asserted that the separation of church from state would mean that the state would become “atheistic and agnostic” and the result would be the “enslavement of the church to the decisions of lay authorities”. Should communism control Italy, it added, there would be “no real guarantee of freedom of religion”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To claim that where there is separation of church and state (as in the United States) there is enslavement is the same as saying that where there is a joining together of church and state (as in Mussolini’s Italy) there is freedom. Nonsense! It is not necessary to refute such &quot;infantile reasoning with the facts; for it appears on the face to be a distortion of the truth. Black for white, d </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">la Jesuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One very interesting point is that only 7 to 10 percent of the population belong t'o political parties. The masses desire freedom and liberty all right, but evidently they are not convinced that any one of the political parties is wholly interested in establishing these basic principles, and so they are prone to take an indifferent attitude toward the whole matter of politics. It is from this large population that the professional politicians solicit support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An ill omen is cast over freedom’s future by the announcement that the most adroit and foxy politician and campaigner, one who heads the greatest Fascist organization in all Italy, namely Pope Pius XII, has personally taken to the field. Starting off his campaign for votes, Pius appealed to the women of Italy to get out and “pack” the ballot boxes. An INS report says, “Catholic, women, to whom the pontiff particularly addressed himself, were delighted he had said; ‘Your hour has struck.’” Experience gained by this organization in other countries has shown that it is very easy to control the vote by using Catholic women voters. No mention is made in this regard as to the part played by the parish priests, it being so obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Garbless Nuns Will Vote Too</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The forth-coming election will be the first free vote cast in Italy in more than twenty years. Knowing that the fighters for freedom will put up a real battle .to obtain democratic liberties the Vatican is putting forth every effort to retain the strangle-hold on the people that she gained with the help of Fascism. Even the nuns are being regimented to vote, a thing unheard of before in Italy. Says the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7">: “The dispensation whereby nuns will not have to wear their habits is probably related to the continuing subtle friction over church and state in Italy, with.the possibility that sisters who appeared in conventional garb might be embarrassed.’&quot; Not only would they be “embarrassed” but, no doubt, their lives would be endangered if they were to appear at the polls in their benighted hoods; for the Italian people have not forgotten how the nuns and priests workbd with the Fascists in oppressing the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All this activity on the part of the Hierarchy show<sup>T</sup>s that the fighters for freedom are up against the same foes even if such leave their fascist hoods at home. We are reminded of what Mr. Bracker of the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> said: “It is impossible to live in Rome many months without having a man on the street and in public buildings and homes identified in a whisper as ‘a famous Fascist’.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The face lifting and plastic surgery done on the fascists of Italy during recent months have not been a total success. Many of their old brutish features are still visible to those who have their eyes open. Signor Parri, of the Actionist Party, in resigning as premier of Italy’s fifth cabinet called attention to this failure of the surgeons when he said, “There are rumors that Washington and London had no trust in me. The real reason for this lack of trust is that Italy has only a fragile front of anti-fascism. The Allies know what’s in back of it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Official circles in Washington and London know that the power back of Fascism was the Vatican. They know that the “Church&quot; supported Mussolini in all of his bloody wars against defenseless people at home and abroad. Well-informed people know all too well that the pope of Rome and his Hierarchy, the driving force back of Fascism, still remain to run . things very much to their own pleasing. Fascism has been destroyed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in name only;</span><span class="font7"> in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">practice</span><span class="font7"> it is still very much alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Real Bone of Contention</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But why is there such a to-do over whether one party or the other is elected in Italy, whether the Hierarchy’s candidate is chosen or rejected ? If the results were peace for Italy and freedom and liberty for her people there would - be little more that could be asked for. However, these are the very things that are now in the balance. If the ex-Fascists regain their hold on the people, no matter by what name they call themselves, there will be little relief extended to the people. If the union of church and state is continued freedom of worship will not be tolerated. The bone of contention, in this struggle, then, is whether the concordat that protects the Catholic Church and suppressed all others will be continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In speaking oiuthis subject of freedom in Italy Hr. Cacciapuoti struck at the real core of the whole matter when he pleaded for freedom of worship. The New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> (November 13, 1945), in reporting his talk sponsored by the American Committee of the World Council df Churches, says,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A plea for aid in procuring religious freedom in Italy was made here yesterday by Dr. Bernardo Cacciapuoti, professor of physics at the University of Rome, who said the position</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ of Protestants had suffered severely even before the war because of the concordat of February, 1929, between the Vatican and the Italian government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. ’ As a result of the signing of the concordat, “Roman Catholics and Fascists were united in their efforts to restrict our liberties and our 1 religious work,” Dr. Caeciapuoti declared at <sup>4</sup> a luncheon of thirty Protestant leaders. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Rev. P. J. Zaccara and the Rev. Robert W. Anthony, who spent three months in Italy this year as representatives of the National Evangelical Committee for Relief in Italy and 'the Federal Council of Churches, respectively, agreed with Dr. Caeciapuoti that religious freedom could be obtained in Italy only with the help of the outside world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a telegram was sent to Truman by a group of Protestants asking for dissolution of the concordat, because it discriminated and suppressed freedom of worship, the Hierarchy got busy and explained that Protestantism was not mentioned specifically in the concordat and that Protestants in Italy have religious liberty under civil law. What is that? Are Protestants no longer considered “heretics” worthy of death! Has the leopard changed its spots! No, not at all. Shortly after this “explanation” Pope Pius XII, on December 13, 1945, sent a letter to the archbishop of Trento in celebration of the opening session of the Council of Trent 400 years ago, which council was called for the very purpose of combating the rise of Protestantism. This letter was to serve as a reminder and warning to Protestants that the Vatican has not forgotten that breach through which thousands escaped the clutches of the “Church” and obtained freedom and liberty to study the Bible and worship God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet, why make such a fuss over the fact that Protestants are suppressed, who make up less than eight percent (some say less than one percent) of the population! For this all-important reason : the basic principles of freedom and liberty demand that the minority, whether eight percent or one-eighth of one percent, be permitted to enjoy the same rights and privileges as the majority. The philosophy that teaches that the majority shall rule, right or wrong, and the minority shall be overlooked is entirely false. The last twenty years proves it. The driving wedge of Fascism that suppressed the minority made it an easy matter to enslave the masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•All of this controversy over the concordat would have been avoided and the fight for human rights would have been simplified had the armistice terms been carried out, particularly those provisions which stated that 'all Fascist organizations will be disbanded, and all laws discriminating against persons on the grounds of creed will be rescinded’. These terms of the armistice must be among those referred to by Anne O’Hare McCormick, correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> as being “annulled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in practice<sup>1</sup>’.</span><span class="font7"> They have become mere scraps of paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Whence Cometh Help? ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until the concordat that puts the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in the place and stead of God is broken there will be no freedom of worship in Italy. And if there is no freedom to worship Jehovah God there will be no opportunity to enjoy other liberties. So, then, where can the people look for help in their fight for this freedom! If they turn to the political parties on the right hand, they find the ex-Fascists who advocate for a continuance of the concordat. If they look to those on the left, the Communists under the leadership of the shrewd Palmiro Togliatti, they find no relief, for, while Saying they favor private property, individual liberty and religious freedom, the Communists show their inconsistency by also announcing that there will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;'no change</span><span class="font7"> in the Lateran Treaty with the Vatican” and the concordat will continue. Surely there is no “political party truly representing the great mass of people”, says Sforza, whom some have characterized as “one of the best-informed political experts in Italy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sforza also says “the Italian people . . . hate monarchy”. “Why,” asks Mr. Churchill of United Feature Syndicate, “is there so much hostility today toward the House ,of Savoy [the monarchy]?” The reason' for this hatred and hostility is that the House of Savoy was one of the three main straws in the Vatican-Fascist-Monarchy totalitarian house of “wood, hay, stubble” that the Jesuits built. The masses of the people do not desire monarchy, nor do they want Communism or Fascism. They want freedom from all of these dictatorial forms of government. But, alas I how will they obtain their desire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The “Commander to the People”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Italy cannot pin their hope on any sinister politician as their leader even if he bears such flattering titles as “primate of Italy”, “pontifex maximus,” “vicar of Christ,” etc. After considering the record no honest person will hail the pope of Rome as the savior of Italy. Neither will they say that his organization is qualified to redeem for Italy the liberty and freedom that she needs so much. Notwithstanding that Pope Pius XII is the strongest man in Italy, still he is not the “Commander to the People”.—Isaiah 55:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is, however, one who rightfully bears this title. His name is Christ Jesus, and because He has been given all power in heaven and earth He is the true Commander around whom the fighters for freedom may rally. This One is fully qualified and capable of clearing out all traces of Fascism from Italy, both political and ecclesiastical. Men of good-will w’ho follow such Leader not only will be brought out into freedom’s open and airy spaces but also w’ill be given life under righteous conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At present Christ Jesus has His witnesses in the earth and they are commissioned to “proclaim liberty to the captives”. (Isaiah 61:1) In the due time their great Commander will see to it that this army of witnesses is sent into Italy, the stronghold of fascistic Catholicism, there to “proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof”. (Leviticus 25:10) The 1946 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font7"> gives assurance of this when it says, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“By the Lord's grace,</span><span class="font7"> the Society will do everything it possibly can to aid” not only Jehovah’s witnesses in Italy but also their good-will companions and will, therefore, “establish an office in that land some day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So rejoice, ye groaning Italians, and be glad with Jehovah’s witnesses. (Bomans 15:10) For when the righteous rule of The Theocracy is in full sw<sup>T</sup>ay over the earth, then it will be said with jubilation that the fight for freedom earth-wide has been won.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Have We Time for Study?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">^QTUDY to shew thyself approved,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">O is the admonition of the apostle Paul. But in these, the last days, when time is so precious and so short the Theocratic minister cries, “Study? When?” None of us can say we have any time to spare before six o’clock in the evening whether in secular work or performing our commission in the full-time service. Even then, at least three nights per week are taken up by meetings and the rest of the time occupied by book studies, street witnessing, at the doors, public meeting advertising, etc. For most of us it is nine o’clock or nine-thirty before we can call our time our own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And We Are Tired &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But there are talks to prepare, book studies to look,up, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font7"> to go over, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolationstc</span><span class="font7"> peruse, So in despair we put our heads down and attempt to discipline our weary brains into an hour or ninety minutes of hard study. Result: eleven o’clock or even twelve we stagger to bed dead tired, our brain in a turmoil, so much so that we are unable to settle down to sleep until one in the morning. Comes the dawn and we wake up, not refreshed, but tired and heavy. This affects us for the rest of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But,” we cry in amazement, “if we do not study at night, when can we do so Well, how about this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us assume that we arrive home at nine-thirty and retire immediately after a light supper; about ten perhaps, not later. Being happily tired because we have had a day full of privileges of service we go of? to sleep quickly, a sound, restful sleep. We have set the alarm for six o’clock a.m., and by that time have enjoyed some eight hours of refreshing relaxation. So at once on waking we arise. Our first act is to prepare a hot drink. Tn the meantime we have opened the door and are taking deep, full breaths of fresh air (see page 70 of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Aid to . Kingdom Publishers, </span><span class="font7">dealing with correct breathing). '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having had our hot drink we can then settle down to sixty or ninety minutes of quiet, uninterrupted study. Our brain is fresh. We have all conditions in favor of absolute concentration, and even at the end of the study period we are not in any way fatigued or mentally weary. The mind has been stimulated rather than overloaded. One hour of such study is worth twice as much done at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is not the only time we can utiliae. There is the lunch time.

<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font7">NE comical thing that occurred during the war was the action of the Northern Baptist Convention at Atlantic City, May 25, 1944. The original resolution started off with the statement, “God has a stake in this war.” The resolution w<sup>T</sup>as presented by “Reverend” Daniel J.

<p><span class="font7">that the Baptists want it known that in time of peace they are for peace, but in time of war they are for war.

Newspapermen chafed at conditions in lands under control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, such as Eire, . Spain, Portugal, Italy and Germany.

<p><span class="font7">AYS TAe </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Medical World:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Animal experiments, as performed in physiological and pharmacological laboratories today, call for serious criticism by the medical man who is actually engaged in practicing medicine. We submit that the majority, if indeed not all, of such experiments arc distinctly misleading as to the deductions drawn from them. It is undoubtedly the experimenting physiologist and pharmacologist who give the lever to the anti-vivisectionist. Can we wonder at this when we read of the endless experiments performed on animals under the guise of medical research that either yield no praetieal results whatever, or merely erroneous conclusions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a recently published book on Insulin by the lecturer in Chemistry at University College, Exeter, we read of an experiment performed in which three dogs were employed. Between two of them a double carotidjugular anastomosis was established, while the body of one of them was kept alive by artificial respiration. Between the latter and the third dog a pancreatic-jugular anastomosis was established. This experiment was an attempt to prove that the secretion of insulin is under control of the vagus centre which depends for its stimulation on the hyperglycaemic condition. This is an ingenious and weird experiment, but what conclusion could be drawn from it? The dogs were in a totally abnormal state throughout the whole experiment. And yet the experimenter expects the practising physician to accept conclusions drawn from such a ghastly piece of laboratory research. Is it not time that the medical profession declare their total disapproval of such experiments? . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We firmly believe that only when we get away from the physiological or pharmacological laboratory, and go back to the bedside, will we begin to ad&lt;t to our knowledge of disease in man. Professor Hastings Gilford wrote in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">British Medical Journal</span><span class="font5"> (Jan. 20, 1934); “There is much to be said for the belief . . . that the chief cause of this new obstacle to progress is the present dominance of experiniental research over clinical and pathological investigation.” We commend these pertinent remarks, which we thorougldy endorse, to those who still pay homage to the animal experimenter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Says </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Medical Times: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Students are trained to believe that a knowledge of the results of animal experiments is a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non</span><span class="font5"> to successful practice. As a matter of fact, such experiments are more frequently misleading in their results than otherwise. No, it is clinical and praetieal knowledge that counts when the former student goes out into the world to deal with patients. Tie may know what is the action of certain drugs on the pregnant uterus of the rabbit, or the effect of destroying the spinal cord of a frog and then dropping a solution of nicotine on the sinus venosus; but when face to fate with a postpartum hemorrhage, or a case of threatened heart failure, his knowledge of these experiments will be of no use whatever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">-John 17:17</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The Old-fashioned Ghost</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">“pHOST” is just a venerated carry-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">VT </span><span class="font7">over from the old Anglo-Saxon word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">gast,</span><span class="font7"> meaning breath or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">spirit, </span><span class="font7">and Corresponds with the modern German word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">geist,</span><span class="font7"> meaning spirit. The generally accepted thought among religionists is that a ghost is a spirit person. Do not the clergy of “Christendom” teach that their so-called “holy ghost” is the third person of a “triune god” I With that idea, doubtless, the producers of the popular King James Version of the Bible used the word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ghost</span><span class="font7"> in their translation, as did also the translators of the Roman Catholic Douay Version Bible. Sensible modern translators who wanted their readers to understand their translation used the words </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">holy spirit</span><span class="font7"> and dropped </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ghost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The spirit of the Lord God Jehovah is invisible to man and is powerful. It is His active force. It is properly called “the holy spirit” because all His active force is holy or applied to righteousness. The holy spirit is not a person or being, and no Bible text authorizes such a religious conclusion. When God puts His spirit upon a creature, that creature is clothed with power and authority to act as the representative or agent of Jehovah God. God put His spirit upon David, as His witness, and David said: “The spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.” (2 Samuel 23: 2) Likewise the Lord God put His spirit of wisdom upon Israelites who were directed to build certain things in connection with the sacred tabernacle. These men were clothed with authority and qualifications to serve the Lord God.—Exodus 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus quoted the prophet Isaiah, who wrote: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to pro-, claim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isaiah 61:1,2; Luke 4:18-21) This scripture shows that the holy spirit is the active force which God conferred upon Jesus as evidence of His authority. God commissioned Jesus to represent Him and to speak with authority in His name. Concerning Jesus the Lord God says: “I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.” (Isaiah 42: 1) This was pictured in the anointing oil that was poured upon the head of the Jewish high priest, whereby he was clothed with authority. Now Jehovah God had placed His spirit upon His beloved Son, thereby anointing Him to represent His Father, Jehovah God</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning Jesus’ being anointed with the holy spirit it is written: “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” (Hebrews 1:9; Psalm 45:7) It is also written: “Even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the holy spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”—Acts 10:38, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These quotations definitely prove that the holy spirit is not a person and is therefore not one of the religious “gods” of a heathenish “trinity”. It is proof that the holy spirit 'is the holy active force of Jehovah God, conferred upon His beloved Son and upon others whom God authorized to represent Him. These and other scriptures expose the falseness of religion’s doctrine of trinity and disclose that the clergy of “Christendom” have misrepresented the Lord God and do willfully misrepresent Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The appearance of a dove at the time that God poured out His holy spirit upon Jesus is no proof of a trinity of “Father, Son and holy ghost”. Jesus was then a perfect man, the only perfect man that ever lived upon earth, aside from Adam when he was in Hden. Jesus then stood upon the banks of the turbulent Jordan declaring His devotion to His Father and God. There God put His holy spirit upon Jesus and clothed Him with full power and authority to speak in His name. There He was beginning His mighty work. He was perfect, holy, harmless, and apart from sinners. Says the prophecy to Him: “Thou art fairer than the children of men ; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee *for ever.” (Psalm 45:2) He was the very embodiment of truth, meekness rfnd righteousness. With frankness and boldness He spoke the truth. “Never man spake like this man.” (John 7:46) The reason was that He was a perfect man entirely devoted to doing Jehovah's will and He came to speak the message which His Father had given Him to speak. Said he: “I have not spoken of myself; hut the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what T should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so 1 speak.” (John 12: 49, 50) God sent Him into the world to speak the truth, and He did speak the truth. He said: “To this end was I horn, and for this cause came T into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:3?) Tt follows, then, that those who contradict or deny the words of Jesus do not speak the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hear now the words of Jesus and note that He brands the teachers of the dogma of the “trinity” as the sons and agents of Satan, the greatest liar that ever existed. To the clergy of His day, who then refused to hear and abide by His words, Jesus said in plain phrase: “If God were your Father, ye wmuld love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speak-eth of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:42-44) The clergy, who have taught and yet teach that the “holy ghost” is a trinitarian person equal to God and Jesus, refuse to hear and obey the Bible truth, and thereby put themselves in the same class to which the Pharisees were assigned by Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such trinitarians say: ‘God, Jesus and the holy ghost are one, co-eternal, of the same identical substance and alike in gower.’ Jesus said: “My Father is greater than I.” (John 14:28) He did not say, My Father is greater than my fleshly body, but He referred to himself as the Son of God, to mean that the Father is greater than the Son to whom He gave life. The clergy' say, in effect, by their “trinity” doctrine, ‘Jesus was and is his own father.’ Those clergymen do not speak by the spirit of God and do not tell the truth. The true relationship between God and Jesus is that of Life-giver, or Father and Liferecciver or Son, and this relationship Jesus always acknowfl edged. He said: “The Father loveth the Son, and shew-eth him all things that himself doeth.” (John 5:20) Jesus never taught His disciples ‘to believe in a holy-gliostifsh person; that is, Tie never taught that the holy<sup>7</sup> spirit of God is a person.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Watchtower Bible College Graduates Sixth Class</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(CONSOLATION</span><span class="font7"> takes pleasure in briefly reporting to its readers another graduation day at the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead. On January 21, 1946, 544 persons gathered in the college auditorium, located in the main building, to either observe or participate in the commencement exercises. Ninety-one students made up the sixth graduating class, of which number eighty-six received diplomas of merit in recognition of a high standard of work. (Class picture on opposite page.) A brief report of the proceedings follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After opening sopg and prayer and a few announcements, the college president and chairman of the assembly, N. H. Knorr, introduced in turn the four college instructors. Each had words of encouragement and farewell for the departing ordained ministers who had received special training for foreign assignment during the past five months. The companionable bond that had sprung up and grown fast between teacher and pupil was apparent to the observer’s eye. The last of this quartet to speak was the college registrar. He added a dash of foreign flavor to the proceedings by reading congratulatory letters and telegrams from previous Watchtower Bible College graduates now stationed in distant lands. In addition to many points in the United States and Canada, messages poured in from Cuba, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Canal Zone, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chile. Incidentally,, however, the sixth graduating class was drawn from various .races and nations. F-ive young ladies were from Canada, a young man and a young woman had traveled all the w’ay from Argentina for the special training, another young man hailed from Brazil, and still another from the island of Jamaica. Three students' were of the colored race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This Bible college is situated on a 700-acre farm near South Lansing,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">N. Y., and the servant in charge of these rolling acres next spoke, but soon gave way to the vice-president of the Society’s New York corporation, who is also the Society’s legal counselor. He ably contrasted God’s supreme law with man’s legal code. Following him came the vice-president of the Pennsylvania corporation, voicing Scripturally sound admonition as to domestic and foreign service assignments and clarifying the objectives set before the graduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still mounting toward the climax of events, the college president took the speaker’s position and spoke for the next hour on “Proving Your Faith”. Mr. Knorr had only a few days previous returned from a ten-week business tour of Europe, and he was well qualified to present information gained firsthand on how Jehovah’s ministers in Nazi concentration camps had proved their faith the hard way. He neatly dovetailed into this European background of faith proved by torturous works his counsel on faith and wmrks addressed to.the sixth graduating class of ministers..seated before him. ‘Faith comes by hearing the word of God,’ and had not they-had an intensive five-month training course in God’s Word and ministry? Surely it would be a boon to their proving faith in the service period ahead of them. He ended on a strong note of confidence that this graduating class of full-time ministers would ever hold fast their faith and integrity and render an acceptable contribution of service to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and universal sovereignty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now the climax—presentation of diplomas! To the happy students this was the symbol of success in their college training course; it announced to the world that they had meritoriously concluded the intensive advanced studies, that they had done their job well. Flushed faces and shining eyeS testified in silent eloquence just how much this</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">symbolic comiriendation of “Well done” meant to the sixth class graduates. In a united expression of appreciation one of their number represented all in reading <sub>t</sub> a resolution. In it they recognized Jeho-■ 'vah as the great Theocrat, Christ Jesus as His King, the. Kingdom as estab-u lished, the woeful state of this old world of Satan, the need of the people for God’s comforting truth, the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to pass on this truth to them, and particularly did they recognize that they had been specially trained for the past five months to do that very thing. In view of these recognized facts they therefore resolved to put the knowledge gained to practical use in the field of gospel-preaching, to stand always immovable for Jehovah’s true worship, to point out steadily and unwaveringly Jehovah’s kingdom as the only hope in a time when a blind world propagandizes its man-made world organization as savior, and to do all this in whatever assignment given to them and thereby aid all men of goodwill toward God to. ‘be glad with Jehovah’s people’. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> wishes them well in their high aims, along with all of Jehovah’S witnesses everywhere. Always standing “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”, the sixth class of the Watchtower Bible College will meet all its resolves.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Name Jehovah</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">P</span><span class="font7">UTTING out </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News, I</span><span class="font7"> came in contact with a lady who asked me, “What kind of religion is this ?” I replied that we are not religionists, but that I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She pondered a while and asked, “Jehovah? Who in the world is he!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I took the Bible and read to her Psalm 83:18: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth”; also Exodus 6 ;3: “And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">She said that she had never been told in her church who Jehovah is, and as she had never read the Bible she supposed Him to be one of the prophets. Noticing on the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> the advertisement of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;, </span><span class="font7">she asked me to bring it to her as soon as possible, because, knowing now who Jehovah is, she has a different opinion of His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some time after this, when I was presenting the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font7"> at the doors, a man told me he would take the book. He took it and started thumbing through its pages. Then suddenly he turned to me, a distasteful expression on his face, handed the book back and said he did npt want it. When I asked him, “Why did you change your mind?” he opened the book at the front, pointed to the word Jehovah, and said, “Jehovah. That’s against our belief.” When I asked him &quot;Who is Jehovah?” he said he did not know; whereupon his wife asked, ‘Was he not one of the prophets?” I then read the two scriptures above quoted and he took the book, rejoicing over Jehovah’s name. —Full-time Kingdom publisher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Priest: Oh, so you are one of the Jehovah’s witnesses, and you don’t salute the flag! How come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Witness: Yes, I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and I want to keep the commandments of God. If you knew what was in the Bible, you would understand why I do not salute the flag.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Witness: Look up Deuteronomy 22: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Priest finds scripture, reads it to himself, and remarks in a whisper: “That is as plain as the nose on your face.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two days after, I was called to the principal’s office. The principal asked, “Donald, what did you say to the father? he seems a changed man: I noticed in church this morning he didn’t wear his skirts.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The principal asked: “Would you show me these scriptures?” This I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Principal: I never knew this was in the Bible; further, I told the superintendent that you are outstanding in your class: you can be trusted with any kind of errand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">story is an interesting one, though it has ' a flaw. But before going into it, here are a few items as to the lady’s wardrobe. She has 200 mantles, and they are not ■cheap mantles either. Her crown and . that of her infant were gifts of the women of Spain. In the lady’s crown there \ are 2,836 brilliants, 5,725 small dia-J monds, 145 pearls, 74 emeralds, 62 rubies, and 46 sapphires. The baby’s crown is smaller. He plays a secondary role in the picture anyway. His crown has 574 brilliants, 200 small diamonds, 12 pearls,' 16 emeralds, and 16 rubies. (No sapphires.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now about the lady’s coming to Spain. It was like this, says the tradition. It was in the year 40 (A.D.), after the apostles had gone out to various territories to preach the gospel, that James, son of Zebedee, who is supposed to have gone to Spain, had a visit from the lady. It was nice of her to come and visit him. But he had shown her equal consideration, for, before.he went, says the tradition, he had come to the lady and asked for her blessing. She told him to go on his projected trip, and in Spain he was to build a church, something no apostle ever thought of doing. After James had been in Spain for a time, the lady came to visit him (he had died in the meantime). She stood on a pillar, and told him, “On this spot,” to build a church, to her memory. The high altar was to be beside the pillar where she stood. The pillar would remain, she is said to have said, “till the end of time.” The church was built (at Saragossa), etc., etc. The only flaw in the account is that James, the son of Zebedee, was executed by Herod, about A.D. 44, not having left Jerusalem. Neither did the other James leave for years thereafter. Even Paul, first to carry the gospel to distant lands, had not yet begun his journeys.—Acts 8:1; 12:1-3,25; 13:1-4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font7"> LITTLE girl then living in Colo* rado thought she would enjoy convent life, then changed her mind, then found she could not back out. The rest is in her own words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the receiving room it was a wonder ful-looking place; nothing better. I . went in Thursday at noon. I had already heard a few things. The old head nun asked me if I thought I would like it there. I told her I hoped so, and she said it didn’t matter if I didn’t. That seared me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had to call the nuns “Mother”, and had to have them unlock the doors even to get in the washroom. Out of bed at 5 a.m., we had prayer, dressed; then to morning mass; then to breakfast. We had prayer before we ate, and right after. Then to work or school. Before we took our lessons or started work we had prayer, and as soon as we stopped we had prayer. We then filed into the dining room. Before we ate we had prayer, and when we finished eating we had prayer. Then we</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">were taken to work or school and had prayer , before we started and prayer when we stopped. Then before we ate again we had prayer, and as soon as we had finished we had prayer. Then we had recreation for a while. Then we went to our dormitories, and before we lay down to sleep we had prayer. Then the head Mother Divine sprinkled us with holy water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We couldn’t go outside until they unlocked the doors, and we were then inside a high stone wall. Inside we could not talk about the outride, and we were not allowed to have news clippings. Our mail from our folks was read before it was given to us to read. We could not talk to visitors privately. We did not dare say we wanted to go home. A nun stayed in the room while my mother and I talked and would not get out until I did. I never went to sleep there at night without crying myself to sleep. I heard others doijjg likewise. Jehovah, whom I now know and love, heard my prayer and I got out in two weeks.—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font7">EW YORK admits it has the biggest population of any city in the United States (7,625,000), with more American-born than Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Houston combined; more Eire-born than Limerick, Cork and Kil-larney combined; more Italian-born than Bologna and Leghorn combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It acknowledges that it has more playgrounds (492) and more parks (764) in more space (17,405 acres); that it has more theaters (672), more taxis (9,371), more restaurants (11,438), more major league baseball clubs (3), more churches (2,800), more schools (855),'more hospitals (172), more public libraries (135), more art musgums (145), and more daily newspapers (28).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It confesses that it has the tallest building (Empire State: 1,250 feet), the longest street (Broadway: 15.8 miles from Battery to City Line, and going on to Albany from there), the biggest store (Macy’s: $112,661,451 yearly sales), the biggest theater (Radio City: 6,200 seats).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It concedes that it has the busiest airfield (LaGuardia: 270 air-liner flights a • day), the busiest railroad station (Pennsylvania: 100 million passengers a year), the largest port (with 308 miles of waterfront), the biggest municipally owned and operated transit system (543 miles of subway, trolley and bus routes), the longest subway ride for a nickel (26.78 miles; which would also be the longest ride for a dime), and the longest boat ride for a nickel (from South Ferry to Staten Island).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It grants that it has more municipal employees (154,865),' more policemen (15,557), and more firemen (9,639); that it has more dogs (301,850) and more trees (2,500,000), issues more marriage licenses (68,742, in 1944), and has the largest birth rate (122,748 new New Yorkers in 1944), with 1,130 sets of twins, 11 sets of triplets, and 1 set of quadruplets. These last named aristocrats, by the way, have the one and only super-de-luxe coach, made for them by Whitney, presented to them by Macy's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It does not deny that the fourteen buildings that go to make up Rockefeller Center, New York, constitute a complete city in themselves, and the biggest city of its kind on earth. They cover 12 acres, house 1,137 firms, and accommodate 152,000 persons daily. It seems almost incredible, but this business headquarters is so large that three men spend their lives picking up cigarette butts, and there is a chewing-gum crew that spends its working hours scraping chewing gum from office floors, corridors and sidewalks in the area. A staff of 25 window cleaners keeps the 15,000 windows bright and 620 men and women do the rest of the cleaning. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And listen! New York city has an American Legion post that is really </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font7"> The Captain Belvidere Brooks post, to its everlasting credit, invited into its membership the 16 Americans of Japanese descent whose names the Hood RiveT, Oreg., post expunged from its rolls because of their ancestry. And in some respects the courage of that act is one of the biggest things about the biggest city. Don’t you honestly think so? Isn’t a big heart bigger than a big building? Of course-it is.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Probably your mother gave you milk of magnesia, or citrate of magnesia, or Epsom salts, before you ever had any interest in printing, and probably she herself did not then know that this metal is found abundantly all over the world, existing not only in sea waters and brine wells, but in an ore called dolomite, which exists in great abundance in the mountainous areas on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The supply is inexhaustible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It took World War II to force this metal to the front. Even before Pearl Harbor, when a German plane had been shot down over England, examination of the wreckage showed that many of the plhne’s parts were made of magnesium alloys. The result was that whereas the actual output of magnesium ingots in America in 1939 was only 3,350 tons, in 1943 the output was 240,000 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magnesium alloys will not burn under any conditions existing in the home or factory. The metal is incredibly light and strong, and the future is filled with vehicles, tools, furniture, farm machinery and a thousand other things that are coming out of this metal, from which more than four times as many units may be obtained as can come from a pound of steel.

Experiments in maintaining soil fertility in the valley 'show that the plant best suited to help produce that result is the yellow-flowered alfalfa.

He explains that the highway is hard to reach, that it is hard to maintain, and that there are not enough attractions to keep the road open. The road is 1,800 miles up and 1,800 miles back, and there are, as yet, no hotels, no gas stations, and no repair shops.

<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Carried Away with Self-Admiration</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HE 100th Battalion, fighting in Italy, and composed largely of Americans of Japanese descent, made a great name for itself. The president of the United States, when he cited the battalion for special honor, said, in part, “The fortitude and intrepidity displayed by the officers and men of the 100th Infantry Battalion reflect the finest traditions of the Army of the United States.” But it wasn’t these soldiers of Japanese descent that were carried away with selfadmiration. Not at all. It was the Hood River, Oreg., post of the American Legion that was carried away with enthusiasm, not for the men cited, but for themselves. They erased the names of sixteen such Japanese-Americans from the county war memorial. Three of the sixteen had been wounded in Italy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same thing that was done at Hood River, Oreg., was also done, on a smaller scale, in Washington, by Spokane post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The only one affected was Richard H. Naito, a Japanese-American with a high record as a private in Uncle Sam’s army in Italy. But the principle was the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A still more deplorable exhibition of the same thing took place at Poston, Ariz. Private Raymond Matsuda, a member of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, who had received seven decorations for heroism on the Italian front, walked into a barber shop for a haircut. He could not walk very well, because he had to have crutches to help him along. He was of Japanese descent. When he got in the shop, a Texan barber by the name of Andrew Hale threw him out. It takes a good deal of whatever it is that Hale has, to do a thing like that.</span></p>

An Ohio man had been arrested in Pittsburgh, Pa. The Ohio police officer came for him, and, even before the man had been formally released to him, began winding a 20-foot chain about </span><span class="font7">him. This so vexed the Pittsburgh magistrate that he refused to honor the warrant at all, and the Ohio man had to go off without his prisoner. As he left. court he admitted that he had “lost his head”. And he had. The prisoner was benefited by the officer’s folly.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Automobilism</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HAT word is all right; it is from the dictionary. The definition is, &quot;The use of automobiles, or the practices, methods, or the like, of those who use them.” So, if we have any pointers on the subject, and we do have a very few, here is a place for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During World War II, the United States supplied Russia with 406,000 motor vehicles. That’s a large order. Allowing 16 feet to the car, that would make a continuous string of cars 1,230 miles long, bumper to bumper. But cars do not run bumper to bumper. Put them 300 feet apart and they would, make a string of cars 24,298 miles long, or almost enough to go around the earth at the equator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the new marsh buggies made for crossing deserts, or exploring bottomless, hummocky, vegetation-choked swamps, are fearsome sights. The tires of these buggies are ten feet in diameter, weigh 315 pounds each, and are so constructed, that, if punctured, the tires are kept inflated by the swamp buggy’s engine, since, obviously, it is impossible to change tires where they-must go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Automobilists should wish to live, and to that end they must beware of carbon monoxide, the colorless, odorless, nonirritating gas that gives no warning of its presence, but has taken so many lives of those who tried to do some little thing to their car in a closed space. In a few moments the air is polluted and the senses are so dulled that there is not sufficient time or mental vigor to plan or carry out .an escape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And automobilists should want others to live. Hence, as they have opportunity they should advise pedestrians to cross roads and streets only &quot;at crossings; cross with the green lights where there are traffic signals; walk against traffic on rural roads, and wear something white for easier visibility at night on country highways.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>“Our Hidden Asylum System”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font7">BOVE is the title given to a folder circulated by some dear English subscribers who believe in fair play for the mentally ill. The folder accompanies a letter from one of the unfortunates. Writing in good taste and with exquisite penmanship to one who has made it her business to comfort such with the truth, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This existence here is terribly nauseating and degrading. I seem to be fixed like a rat in a trap. Poor law and lunacy ■methods are identical. My clothes, which were new, have been destroyed, and although I have written repeatedly affirming the guardian’s liability, and soliciting an interview, I cannot elicit any answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I should like to make the attempt to get something to do, although, with a ten-year reference from a madhouse, the probability is extremely remote. A respectable appearance is, of course, a sine qua non. At one time I was considered one of the smartest accountants in the city. I have passed the preliminary and intermediate examinations as an accountant, have kept the books of one of the largest shipping organizations, and could still make myself valuable. I would try to do right by, and would work day and night for, anyone who would give me a ehanee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I trust you are in good health, and that God will bless you in your work. I have loaned my books to several persons. One is reading them now. Thank you, from my heart, for so kindly keeping me in mind. I have been accustomed to say that there is not a soul in the world that cares whether I live or die. I cannot truthfully affirm that while you evince such a kind and sympathetic interest. [From the patient]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Turning now again to the folder itself (the authorship o'f which is not disclosed) here are some of the statements which it contains: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' ' There is hidden away beneath the fairseeming surface of our twentieth-century life . an underworld of woe,- of which few of those </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font5">who move about in happier spheres have the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">least idea. No echo of its miseries, its ignominy and despair is suffered to assail the ears of men. . . . Imagine a shrinking mortal, for-lo^n, unhinged, distraught with dread, plunged suddenly into the midst of conditions calculated in a special degree to increase rather than allay the trepidation and acute anxiety to which he has (unaccountably to himself) become a prey. Reflect that no blame, whatever attaches to such a patient; that what we have to deal with is only a condition brought about by a transient disorder' of our highest faculties requiring the most delicate handling possible, an unbalancement which, as often as not, is due to quite natural and sufficient causes, and it is borne in upon us that a grave injury thus thoughtlessly inflicted must be characterized as not only irrational, but in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">high degree reprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remark is often ipade by the sane that “to be confined for a time among lunatics would be enough to drive one mad”; but there are many hundreds of our fellow men not yet insane who are in that very position at the present moment, to whom no helping hand is ever extended by those safe in the upper air. As is well known, there are all degrees in the process of becoming unsound in mind. When the slightly unbalanced find themselves shut in between four unsealable blank walls, only opening at one end to a vista of increasing horrors, with scarcely a reassuring word from anyone to give them a glimmer of good hope as regards the future; when they have no idea of what are the allegations made against them, and when not a syllable of their own statement of the case will be listened to in self-defense; when they are hustled together like a herd of animals, is it any wonder that all hope in God or man de-1 sects them, and they feel themselves hanging as by a thread over an abyss? It is self-evident that this is the most unnatural way either to prevent or cure insanity.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>The Punishment of Two Bad Crows</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HERE are some people that stand up for the crows, and there are some that stand up against them. The latter are called scarecrows, and they prevent some crows from being bad that would otherwise be bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But no scarecrow would ever have daunted that bad crow of Bergenfield, N. J., that went by the name of Gypsy Gillies. His owner’s name was Gillies; he was just plain Gypsy, and a bad one at that. He stole dimes from a newsstand. That shows he was a thief. He emptied the Gillies’ home of rings, buttons, thimbles and trinkets. That was crooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He did worse. He sat up in a tree and when he saw a youngster come along with the kind of ice cream that he liked best, he dive-bombed and grabbed a mouthful. At length came his ruin. He spied two small children eating muffins. He swooped down, took a bite of one of the muffins and scratched one of the children slightly on the chest. A call went in to the police. They called the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The final decision was that Gypsy he taken 25 miles from Bergenfield And be turned loose in the woods to shift for himself. ’Twas a noble and just decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Crow Trial and Execution</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Elmer Ransom, writing in the Indianapolis </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font7"> gives some interesting details about a crow trial and execution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last spring I was tramping through, the Savannah river swamp country when T heard a great conclave of crows. I slipped cautiously through the brush to the edge of the open glade. A single crow was perched on a dead limb of a tall cypress. Circling around him, chattiring, accusing, was the entire flock of some thirty or forty birds. The single crow, feathers ruffled, uttering short, plaintive caws, watched them as a condemned man might eye a hostile mob bent on his lynching. Finally one crow darted at the perched bird, knocking him off the limb. He fought back, but it was futile. He had been tried and condemned, or so it looked. The unequal battle raged in the air for a minute or more. Then the accused tried to fly off over the trees, but his pursuers struck him again and again, until finally he tumbled downward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The strangeness of thus procedure can be appreciated only when you remember the extreme helpfulness of crows to one another. They fight, feed and hunt in packs, protecting one another, helping a wounded fellow, showing every sign of distress when one bf their number is in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What crow ethic the condemned bird had violated I do not presume to know. I know, however, that ornithologists often laugh at the idea of a 'crow trial’ with its resulting death penalty. Possibly they are right and there is some simple explanation of this odd behavior. I’m not so sure myself. The crow is a bird of mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tn his story about this crow Mr. Ransom had some other interesting things to say about the tribe from which these two condemned sinners came:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crow estimates to a nicety your gun’s range and keeps a feather’s tip beyond it. He remains perched in a tree while you ride by. But stop, and he is off before you can raise your gun. When he'eats or drinks he posts a sentry, and if three of you crawl into a blind he ventures near only when three of you have crawled out and gone away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He competes with man for the fruit of the earth and thus, by man-made standards, he is a thief and robber. He appropriates eggs, chicks and corn. Fact is, his voracious appetite calls for anything edible, animal or vegetable, living or dead. He robs the nests of song birds; preys upon ducks, duck eggs and other waterfowl. No good word is spoken for the crow, except by some trained naturalists who may assure you with quiet conviction that, by and large, he does mankind more good than harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A farm agent in famous Lancaster county,, Pennsylvania, claims that crows are natural enemies bf the corn borer, the cutworm, the common white grub and the grub of the Japanese beetle, but 'a list of the things that they can and do eat is almost endless. The following is described as a method used by two crows to rob a hen of some of her family:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a hen is guarding her chicks, one crow will alight near her on the ground, sidling about like a good friend of the family, or like any old rooster, until her fears are allayed. Then he suddenly seizes the nearest chick in his beak and goes off with it in a hurry, while she vainly chases him. Then the second crow, who has been perching quietly near by, swoops down and picks up another, sometimes two.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>In Utah and Washington</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font7">HE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salt Lake Tribune</span><span class="font7"> acknowledges that the Navajo Indians, though devoutly religious, are not Christians. That should be a real help to those who ■have the idea that religion and Christianity, instead of being opposites, are one and the same thing. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font7"> explains that to get to be a Navajo medicine man there must be no record of the candidate’s ever having lost his temper. Call it what you will, Jesus overthrew the tables of the money-changers. He did not merely stop to mildly reprove them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not sure if the superintendent of the Utah state hospital at Provo is a medical man or not, but a group of ex-patients at that hospital have made some recommendations that should have attention. They think the superintendent of a hospital should be employed under civil service regulations, and not merely because he has political backing. They do not think well of the ease with which two citizens can swear away the liberty of a third man, have him locked up as insane, and put him in such a position that only the superintendent can decide whether he may have his liberty. They would like to see hospital attendants trained for their work, so as to prevent their injuring the patients by the use of violence. Inasmuch as some of the patients have boils, eczema and other ailments that may be transmitted from one to another, they would like to see the barbering tools sterilized. Finally, they ask for the installation of recreation and occupational therapy devices, to do away with idleness and stagnation. AU these suggestions seem temperate and reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The evidence that the doctors will eventually have to do something about their stand ift favor of aluminum cooking utensils grows. There was a small church convention at Bellingham, Wash. Forty of the delegates from out of town were suddenly taken ill with what, in the press, is always called “food poisoning”. The condition of twenty was reported as critical. The newspaper story did not say anything about the fact that cancer is growing by leaps and bounds. It merely said that the city “health officer” had taken samples of the food to Seattle for “tests”. Nothing is ever found under such circumstances. The main objective is to conceal the ravages of the dread cancer. The American Medical Association does not dare come out now and acknowledge that it has been dead wrong on this subject for twenty, yes, forty years. It is in the same predicament as the purveyors of “eternal torture” and “purgatory”. It wants the money and it dares not face the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is another thing they need to give attention to up in the state of Washington, and that is the custom of jailers’ letting prisoners torture other prisoners by their so-called “kangaroo” courts. In the Kings county jail, Seattle, two convicts strapped John Emberg, 16, head downward, and lit cigarettes placed between his/toes. By these and similar methods they succeeded in killing the boy within thirty days. The kill</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ers will be tried for murder, hut what have known all the time that this kind about the so-called “officials” who must of thing was being done?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>From a California Pasturer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font7">THE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> of October 10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font7">1945, there is an article on garbage disposal and hog-raising at Fontana, Calif. In experimenting with porkers of different ages and breeds, I find that certain kinds of apple peelings will cut the throat and stomach lining of a hog crisscross, and then the germs will enter the blood, sometimes causing death. Aluminum containers are the most poisonous in connection with the porkers' feed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tn my experiments, 1 find that a porker feeding on a certain kind of feed will lay on a layer of fat akin to that feed: change to other garbage or more deteriorated food and the second layer of fat will he altogether different from the first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If a porker gets garbage with fish offal in it, that layer will contain a poison, and any layers of fat put on afterwards will also be contaminated. When testing a porker’s blood, if it is almost black it is high time to make a change in its feed, give it some charcoal and put it on a grass pasture for not less than ninety days. The grass changes the layers of fats into a good, wholesome fat, after which the porker can be finished off with grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All hogs of any breed or age should have clean cold water to drink. Take a small half-round trough, put it on an angle and then turn the water down it at a speed just sufficient for the porker to wash his under jaw when he gets his drink from the running water. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another thing: Coffee grounds are injurious to the hog family.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>The Federal Bureau of Investigation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">E</span><span class="font7">VERY man who does anything worth while has satisfaction in doing a job when it is well done; and so J. Edgar Hoover is justified when in a public address to the American people he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember that from dawn this morning until dawn tomorrow morning, 3,928 major crimes will have been committed, including 33 homicides, 814 burglaries, 1G2 robberies, 2,258 larcenies, 22 rapes, 515 auto thefts, and 122 aggravated assaults. The criminal forces of America will have extorted and collected their daily tax of over $41,000,000 for the invisible empire of lawlessness that exists within our midst. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, I am proud of the record of the Bureau. For instance, in the past 15 years the Federal Bureau of Investigation has cost the taxpayers less than $50,000,000 and returned to those taxpayers of the nation a profit of more than $190,000,000, and this even includes those early days when we were rebuilding the Bureau. I hope that our services to society in the apprehension and conviction of over 43,000 notorious criminals during the past 10-ycar period arc achievements beyond the capabilities of financial measurement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In doing this the F.B.I. has paid heavily in effort and even in life itself; 12 of our men have died in the line of duty, others have injured their health by overwork and overexposure and have joined their fellows where the rattle of machine-gun fire is unknown. Nor has the sacrifice ceased there. The long hours of vigil and the sorrow bravely faced by the women who stand behind the men of the F.B.I. are an inspiration to the living and a monument to their sacrifice. Today seven of the widows arc a part of our organization, because they wanted to take their husbands’ places and carry on for them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>“BE GLAD. YE NATIONS”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Nations have risen against nations in ruthless global war. Millions of people from these nations have died on the field of battle. Yes, it was an all-out effort by nations to defeat fear and usher in gladness. But face the facts and ask yourself, Has such cherished reward been attained through these years of warfare<sup>1</sup>! Certainly not, as today nations of the earth seeking gladness through efforts of men are helplessly huddled in trembling fear, as the destructiveness of atomic power hovers over the scene, uncertainly and unreliably held in the hands of imperfect man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Binging to the far corners of the earth as a result thereof is heard the conscientious cry from honest hearts, “How can nations today be glad?” Needful indeed is the true, comforting answer to such cry, and it shall not go unheeded by the merciful God Almighty. Rather, such was answered from His Word the Bible by the president of the Watchtower Society in a public address entitled &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“BE GLAD, YE NATIONS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This message, as delivered to an overflow audience of more than 12,000 at Baltimore, Maryland, on February 10, was most enthusiastically received. The lighted path to gladness, though in this sorrowing, dark world, was made clear to them, and great was their rejoicing. Knowing that millions more would desire this heart-cheering message, it was released at the above occasion in printed form. Two and a half million copies of this new 64-page publication contained within an attractive three-color cover have been printed. You may now receive your personal copy by mail upon a contribution of only 5c. Beading this booklet will leave you glad, we are certain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
