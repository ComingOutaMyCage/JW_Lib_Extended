<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>In Brief</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meteorological Observations</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ That long word &quot;meteorological” merely means “pertaining to the atmosphere and its phenomena”. It does very well to describe some items at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The location of the electric north pole changes slightly from year to year. At present it is located in Canada, 1,200 miles from the geographical north pole. There have been times when the variation in location of the electro-magnetic north pole has made a difference as great as 35°. When a navigator is in a locality where, for example, the error from due north is known to be 15 degrees to the east, he turns the body of the compass until the needle is over the 15 degree mark east of the north arrow. The arrow then indicates due north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Russians, have established automatic weather stations all over the Arctic. Following this procedure Uncle Sam now gets a great number of robot weather reports. Unmanned balloons equipped with radio transmitters are sent up at points hundreds of miles from any ■ weather station, and automatically transmit the temperature, barometric pressure and wind velocity at various' levels up to as much as fifteen miles from the earth. Methods now in use make possible the location of a, thunderstorm 2,000 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All about its coast, the edges of the Greenland icecap are retreating farther inland, due to the action of what may be described as a horizontal chimney thousands of miles in length. A storm starts ' north, up along the Atlantic coast. In due course it loses its moisture, but its hot dry winds finally reach Greenland. Such storms formerly went clear across the ocean and landed in the British isles. Now, for some reason not readily apparent, such storms move northward rather than northeastward. As a consequence the Greenland ice is retreating. The same phenomena are observed in Alaska and in Siberia.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark30"></a>CONSOLATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">“And in His name shall the nations hope.”—Matthew 12:21, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.S.</span><span class="font7"> R </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XXVII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y., Wednesday, July 31, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 701</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A Symposium on Tobacco</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font6">HEN Columbus sailed through the West Indies to San .Salvador, he little dreamt that some day practically the whole world would be indulging in the strange custom which he saw the natives of this new land practicing, namely, inhaling the smoke of a weed that has since become known as tobacco. The name comes from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tabaco,</span><span class="font6"> a tube-like instrument used in Haiti, in which the burning leaves of the plant were placed, enabling the user to inhale the fumes through the nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early explorers discovered that tobacco was used not only in San Salvador and adjacent islands but through all of North America and South America. It was unknown in the rest of the world before the days of Columbus. Today there are few countries and islands of the sea where tobacco is not known and grown. World production every year runs into hundreds of millions of pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tobacco belongs to the Solanaeeae plant family, and is therefore related to the tomato, the eggplant and the potato. The species is called Nicotiana and is composed of some fifty different members. The seeds of the tobacco plant are so small that it takes 300,000 to 400,000 of them to equal an ounce. It is not uncommon for one plant to produce a million seeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Spaniards in search of gold entered Mexico in 1519 they found the native Indians cultivating tobacco instead of merely making use of that which grew wild. It was not until 1535 that the Spaniards themselves began to cultivate tobacco in the island of Haiti. During the next hundred years the Spaniards and Portuguese built up a tobacco trade between the old and new 'worlds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About this time a new world power began to rise and extend its influence into the new and strange country called America. .The Englishman Sir Walter Raleigh founded the Virginia colony in 1584, and its first governor, Ralph Lane, is said to have been the first Englishman to smoke tobacco. In 1586 Ralph Lane and Sir Francis Drake introduced the smoking of tobacco to Sir Walter Raleigh. They gave him a native Indian pipe and showed him how to huff and puff, and its nicotine-laden fumes soon had him snared for the rest of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And speaking of Indian pipes calls to mind that relics found in the mounds of the Mound Builders of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa show that pipe-smoking was practiced many years before Columbus discovered America. Since then pipes have varied in design from the simple “corncob”, which is said to date back to the pioneer Daniel Boone, to the elaborate Persian </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">kalyun,</span><span class="font6"> hookah or water pipe, consisting of a bowl for burning the tobacco, a water bottle through which the smoke is washed and cooled, and the long flexible tube with its mouthpiece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Slavery and Tobacco</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In reading about the history of tobacco and its rise to importance as a world commodity one is impressed with the fact that tobacco and slavery became closely associated. Cultivation of tobacco in the English settlement of Jamestown began in earnest when John Rolfe plant-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.1</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">ed the first commercial acres in 1612. By 1619 20,000 pounds were raised and shipped to England, from this Virginia colony, and in the same year the first shipment of Negro slaves landed at Jamestown. By 1700 18,000,000 pounds , of tobacco a year were being produced '^n Virginia at the cost of the blood and fcweat and tears of the slaves. The tobacco business extended north into Maryland, which made tobacco legal tender in 1724 at one penny a pound. When the Revolution broke out Virginia and Maryland together were annually raising 100,000,000 pounds of the Indian weed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following the Revolution pioneers began moving west and took with them tobacco seeds. Tobacco-raising was begun in Tennessee, Kentucky<sup>7</sup>, Ohio and Missouri. At one time Missouri was the leading tobacco-producing state. Today the United States is the largest tobaccoproducing country in the world. It is no cause for boasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tobacco in Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Frenchman Andre Thevet, who visited Brazil in 1555, took back with him some seeds of the tobacco plant and became the first to raise tobacco in Europe. But its use did not spread until Jean Nicot, French ambassador to Portugal, popularized its use in the French court. Of him history records:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Maister John Nicot, being Embassador to his Maiestie in Portugal!, in the yeere of our Lorde 1559, went one day to see the Prysons of the King of Portugal!, and a Gentleman, being the Keeper of the said Prysons, presented him with this hearh as a strange plant brought from Florida. The same Maister Nieot caused the said hearb to be set in his Garden, where it grewe and multiplycd marvellously. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1561 Nicot sent some of the tobacco to fhe<sub>x</sub> French court and also sent some to the queen mothe'r, Catherine de’ Medici. As a result the terms </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nicotiana</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">nicotine,</span><span class="font6"> from Nicot, arc applied to to-baceo' ahd its drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About this time, too, the Spanish physician Francisco Fernandes, having been sent by King Philip IT to Mexico to study the cultivation of the strange plant, returned and began raising it in Spain (1558). It was not long until it was also being cultivated in Portugal, Beb gium, Italy<sup>7</sup> and the Netherlands. In the beginning of the.seventeenth century its cultivation and use had spread to Persia, India and other Asiatic lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although tobacco was first introduced into Europe by Spain, where the custom of chewing it was begun in 1502, the smoking of the weed was first popularized in England. Sir Richard Grenville, after a visit to America, began producing pipe tobacco in 1585. Sir W<sup>T</sup>alter Raleigh induced English courtiers to take up the practice. He even persuaded Queen Elizabeth to try a pipeful of the “bewitching vegetable”. It bewitched her all right. She became deathly sick, but had gained the distinction, though a doubtful one, of being the first woman on record to smoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While pipe-smoking was fashionable in the Elizabethan court, the French court favored snuff. Louis XIII pronounced snuff-taking “far daintier and more elegant” than “puffing out tobacco smoke”. Cigars began to take the place of snuff about the end of the eighteenth century, and cigarettes lagged along until 1856, when they<sup>7</sup> started to rise in popularity, although the aborigines of San Salvador “rolled their own” in corn shucks in Columbus’ day. Cigarettes today are by<sup>7</sup> far the leading form in which the nicotine narcotic plagues the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tobacco and Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At first it was believed that tobacco possessed “miraculous healing powers”, and it was therefore called “herba santa”. Spenser referred to it as “divine tobacco”, and William Lilly<sup>7</sup> called it “our </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">holy </span><span class="font6">herb nicotian”. But this notion had its origin with the demon-w<sup>7</sup>orshiping Indians/who used it in their religious ceremonies. They believed it to possess great</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">curative properties for such diseases aS bronchitis, asthma and rheumatism. The tobacco pipe held among the North American Indians a place of peculiar significance in their religious rites. The calumet, peace pipe or medicine pipe was the object of great veneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The attitude of the Catholic Hierarchy, on the subject of tobacco is interesting. In 1575 a Mexican council ordered Catholics throughout Spanish America to stop smoking during the performance of the mass. Thirteen years later the Church council in Peru put a ban on all forms of tobacco, with the threat of everlasting damnation for those who violated it. In other words, those who smoked here would also smoke hereafter. Pope Urban VIII, in 1642, made a general interdiction barring smoking in the churches. Later Pope Innocent XI refused promotion to any priest who used tobacco. But Pope Benedict XIII, in 1725, said snuff-taking was all right, 'even in St. Peters at Borne. Whether these contradictory popes spoke infallibly is not recorded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1604 King James I of England published a book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Counterblasts to Tobacco,</span><span class="font6"> in which he described it as coming from the “Devill himself&quot;..- He blasted the idea that “this filthie smoake” was able to “purge the head and stomache of rhewmes and distillations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tobias Venner, in 1620,-wrote with much truth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tobacco drieth the brain, dimmeth the sight, vitiateth tlfe smell, hurteth the stomach, destroyeth the concoction, disturbeth the humors and spirits, corrupteth the breath, in-dueeth a trembling of the limbs, exsiccateth the windpipe, lungs and liver, annoyeth the milt, scorcheth the heart and causeth the blood to be adusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy of Melancholy, </span><span class="font6">Burton wrote that to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">most men, which take it as tinkers do ale, ’tis a plague, a mischief, a violent purge of goods, lands, health,—hellish, devilish, and damned tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Legislation Against Tobacco</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England the growing of tobacco was legally forbidden in 1660 and Charles II ordered all tobacco plants uprooted. By 1782 its cultivation was finally suppressed, and the ban was not lifted until 1910. One who in England held a responsible position, like that of a school teacher, was to be “no puffer, of tobacco&quot;. In many other countries the authorities tried to eliminate the defiling effect of tobacco by prohibiting its use. Several of the American colonies enacted laws ' against tobacco and imposed fines on those who violated them. In Connecticut smoking in public was forbidden in 1647.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Swiss council of Appenzell in 1653 prohibited smoking in any part of the city, even in the homes. In the year 1644, in Switzerland certain cantons made smoking a crime next to adultery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The shah Abbas of Persia, realizing that tobacco was detrimental to childbirth, forbade its use and went to the extreme of burning a merchant together with his stock of tobacco. The shah Sefi also gently discouraged smoking by pouring molten lead down the throats of offenders. This method of overcoming the tobacco habit, however, is not recommended. Hehan Geer, the Mogul emperor in 1617 enforced the death penalty for the use of tobacco in any form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a tobacco dealer offered the Turkish sultan Amurah IV an enormous sum for the concession of selling tobacco in Asia Minor, not only was the offer turned down but the use of tobacco was * made an offense punishable by death. The law was enforced for half a century, and it is said that some 25,000 were put to death for violating it. With Turkish playfulness offenders had their pipes thrust through their noses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Russia the czar was equally-ruthless in dealing with the tobacco evil. A special, court was set up, and those caught selling the forbidden merchandise were given a public whipping; while one found smoking, after being flogged, had his nostrils slit to remind him- </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">to repeat the offense. At Novgorod, Russia, in 1623, those who were caught smoking were forced to swallow a bagful of . tobacco as a cure. The severity of these measures did not blot out the use of tobacco. The habit had too strong a hold on its victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Advertising to Mislead</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• The means used by manufacturers to bring the whole human race, man, woman and child, under the enslaving control of ’ tobacco, has been that of advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old idea that .it was effeminate to smoke cigarettes was overcome by advertisements representing “he men” as smoking them. By similar means women were persuaded that smoking was smart and fashionable and a mark of social standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To put their advertising campaign across the tobacco cartel has employed the most skillful propagandists, the , shrewdest lawyers, the best photographers and illustrators, the prettiest models, the finest radio talent and the most deceptive slogans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So-called “testimonials” have been widely used to persuade the readers of advertisements to smoke. Famous movie actors, athletes, statesmen (or politicians), businessmen and doctors have been paid to sign statements praising </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">recommending the use of tobacco and cigarettes of one kind or another. The public seldom question the integrity of the men and women who sign such * testimonials. Many of them are “faked”. As an example the case of the opera star Giovanni Martinelli may be mentioned. He had endorsed a statement reading, &quot;These cigarettes never make my throat sore.” To a reporter who questioned him about this Martinelli said, laughing, &quot;They never make my throat sore. I never smoke them. I never smoked anything </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in my </span><span class="font6">life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A more recent example is that of Hank Greenberg, home run king of the Detroit Tigers. In the Detroit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News,</span><span class="font6"> issue of April 15,1946, page 23, appears' a 9&quot; x 14&quot; cigabette advertisement. Under a large picture of the baseball player was this “testimonial”: “ ‘There’s no hocus-pocus about itf says Hank Greenberg, baseball’s home run star. ‘I’ve read the reports, and Medical Science has </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">proved </span><span class="font6">you can’t beat Raleighs for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">less nicotine . . . less throat irritants</span><span class="font6"> ... all-round </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">safer smoking! I</span><span class="font6"> recommend Raleighs to all my friends. Raleighs are right!’ ” Then in the same paper, the same date, on page 17, in a sport’s article appeared this statement: “ I feel fine now, better than I have for some time,’ said Greenberg. ‘The doctors said I had a stomach disorder and I’m giving up cigarettes and coffee. I never was much of a smoker anyway. I’m sleeping better now and I feel much better.’ ” Was Greenberg here retracting his testimonial? No; for the same cigarette endorsement appeared nine days later in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune.</span><span class="font6"> Hank had been paid for it. Now for some truthful testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Testimony of Athletes</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gene Tunney, former heavyweight boxing champion of the world, and a lieutenant compiander in the U. S. N. R. during the war, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I’ve always opposed the pernicious advertising that extols, the “benefits” of tobacco-using. While I was training for my second fight with Jack Dempsey I was offered $15,000 to endorse a certain brand of cigarettes. I didn’t want to be rude, so, in declining, I merely said I didn’t smoke. Next day the advertising man came back with another offer: $12,000 if I would let my picture be used with the statement that “Stinkies must be good, because all my friends smoke them”. That compelled me to say what I thought—that cigarettes were a_ foul pestilence, and that advertising which promoted their use was a national menace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Connie Mack, the famous baseball hero, never hired league players who used tobacco. He once said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is my candid opinion—and I have watched very closely the last twelve years or more—that boys at the age of ten to fifteen who have continued smoking cigarettes do not, </span><span class="font6">as a ffile, </span><span class="font4">amount to anything. They are </span><span class="font6">un</span><span class="font4">fitted in every way for any kind of work where brains are needed. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Acrolein is one of the most terrible drugs in its effect on the human body. The burning of ordinary cigarette paper always produces acrolein. ...

<p><span class="font4">There is no agency in the world today that is so seriously affecting the health, efficiency, education, and character of our boys and girls as the cigarette habit. Yet very little attention is paid to it. Nearly every delinquent boy is a cigarette smoker.

<p><span class="font6">Dr.. Logan Clendeniftg writes a syndicated column of medical advice for the newspapers. On one occasion a mother . inquired as to whether cigarette smoking was injurious to her son. He replied that “smoking is not a health hazard and does not dull the -mind”. On another occasion he wrote that ■ tobacco must be all right because the Indians used it for medical purposes. Perhaps he would also commend the medical practices of the Dark Ages. Later he retracted some of his statements about tobacco, saying, “I was not aware of any scientific study of the subject when I wrote as I did.” In other words, he did not know what he was talking about when he said tobacco was not a health hazard. This ignorance was hardly excusable, for there is a great mass of scientific information on the subject, and it might reasonably be expected that a “doctor” who professes to give reliable information would inform himself on the subject. But Dr. Clendening could hardly plead ignorance, for a year before his assertion that tobacco was not a health hazard he had written: ‘T believe that a number of people, especially those who chew tobacco, have ruined their health for life by creating an inflammation of the stomach and bowels, and consequently, malnutrition and underweight.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Some of the greatest scientists and doctors of the world have shown that tobacco is a rank poison, undermining the health. Such information, however, does not appear in cigarette advertisements. Nor have newspapers been disposed to publish such information and thereby offend advertisers. But some brief excerpts will be published here. They are only a small fraction of all the information available, derived from well-known doctors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Is the comfort which the use of tobacco gives real happiness? I answer, no, it is illusory.

<p><span class="font6">Superior Court Judge John A- Sbar-baro, of Chicago, signed 4,220 divorce decrees. That is an astounding record.

<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Earthworms Are Humble Servants</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE lowly worms that industriously toil below the surface of the ground seldom receive a word of thanks from those who profit from their work. Only . when it is their misfortune to come out in view does man give them his personal attention by heartlessly crushing them beneath his weight with a curse on his lips. And yet earthworms are among man’s greatest friends and most faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Over a thousand species of these humble creatures' have already been classified, and there are many more. They are found in practically all parts of the earth with the exception of the high altitudes and the frozen latitudes and the dry and sandy wastelands of the deserts. Some are strictly aquatic; others are exclusively terrestrial; still others are both land and water inhabiters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Earthworms vary in length from a few inches to several feet. In North America they never measure over a foot, but in , the tropical countries, as South America; Africa, and India, they measure several feet. One species in Australia attains to the unbelievable length of five feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The habits of earthworms are very much alike in all climates. They burrow endless tunnels in damp, ground by swallowing everything as they go. The common types ordinarily go down to a depth of two feet and at night will come out on the surface and eat certain vegetation. In cold weather they know enough. to close the entrances to their subway system, and if it gets very cold and the ground starts to freeze they manage to tunnel low enough to survive, though it is known that some species can stand actual freezing. Another common practice among the earthworm nations is to build cocoons for their young ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that the Greeks were aware of the importance of earthworms in the soil but only in comparatively recent times has their importance been calibrated through laboratory experiments. Says the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The importance of earthworms as cultivators of the soil can scarcely be overestimated. By their burrowing they render it porous and permeable to the rain and air; they continually turn the earth by bringing up soil from beneath the surface and they add to its fertility by burying vegetable matter and by their secretions. Darwin has estimated that earthworms bring to the surface in rich meadow lands not less than one-fifth inch of soil per annum, and recent laboratory experiments demonstrate most emphatically the beneficial influence on plants of the presence of earthworms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is rather surprising, in view of the importance of the earthworm to man, to find so little written on-the subject for the general public to read. Only once </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">a while is one heard singing the praises of these little industrious creatures who tirelessly toil for man and never think of striking. One of the most recent of the few articles on earthworms was one written by Alfred H. Sinks and published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Collier's</span><span class="font6"> Magazine. Among other things Mr. Sinks said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To most people, earthworms are just slimy, disagreeable creatures that slobber about underfoot after a hard rain. They are good for fish bait and nothing else. But that is about as far from the truth as it could possibly be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Most of us have done enough gardening to know that it is the layer of fertile topsoil on top of the earth that enables things to grow at all. Earthworm fans claim their small champion has a monopoly on its manufacture; for each earthworm is his own miniature chemical factory. He eats all the decaying vegetable and animal matter that falls on the surface of the earth. His digestive juices convert this mass of organic matter into the chemicals that support plant life. Results of tests have differed a great deal under different conditions and on different soils, but they show that what comes out of the earthworm may contain as much as five times more nitrogen, seven times more</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">phosphates, and eleven times more potash than what went into him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So much for the earthworm as a fertilizer ■ factory. In addition to that, he’s an in def at i. gable piek-and-shovel man. As he eats his way along, sometimes going down as deep as five or six feet, he grinds up and pulverizes the soil, 'doing the work of plow, disk and harrow, j Fill a mason jar with layers of clay, sand and topsoil, put in a few worms and give them a few days’ time to work, and you’ll see the different layers of earth intermingle until the worms have done a job as thoroughly as an egg beater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But more than that, the earthworm is a great drainage engineer. Rain water runs off the surface of hard-packed soil and is wasted. But earthworms leave behind them a maze of small-bore tunnels that lets the water get down around the plant roots and then holds it there. Tests have shown that soil filled with earthworms can drink up four inches of rain in fifteen minutes, whereas wormless soil will take three hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally the earthworm gives his own body to the cause he serves. His decaying carcass adds just that much more topsoil to enrich the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unfortunately not nearly enough has been, done to measure the effect of earthworms on the growth of plant species. The few really scientific tests that have been made are, however, significant. One scientist planted his test seeds in sets of two boxes each. In each case the seed went into one box with earthworms, one without. For oats the worms seemed to make little difference, for the worm-filled box produced only 3 percent more than the other. But the worms really went to work on rye, potatoes, vetch,- field peas, and rape! They produced 64 percent more rye, 136 percent more potatoes, 140 percent more vetch, 300 percent more peas, and 733 percent more rape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Want to Wiggle into the Worm Business?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If earthworms are that important to successful gardening why doesn’t somebody start raising them for farmers? Somebody has. In fact several people are now malang their living raising these little friendly squirmers. .Out in Worthington, Ohio, Miss Bernice Warner quit her job as an accountant for a paint company so that she could spend all her time raising wigglers; and she doesn’t scream when she handles them either! She says that her worms eat twelve pounds of sugar, twelve pounds of suet, and twelve pounds of corn meal every month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anybody can start raising his own army of soil tillers. Miss Warner got her start after reading about Dr. George S. Oliver’s worm business * out in Fort Worth, Texas. Dr. Thomas J. Barrett of Roscoe, Calif., is another who is in the business and supplies “egg-capsules” containing about twenty worm eggs for those who want to incubate their own. It takes from 14 to 21 days for them to hatch, and in *60 to 90 days they start laying eggs themselves, A million of them to the acre will increase the productivity of the soil amazingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the next time you are out in the garden and you see one of these little creatures worming its way through the soil do not look with contempt upon it as an enemy but remember that it is a harmless friend and humble servant.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Armageddon Is at the Door</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE inability of any one nation or group of nations to control atomic energy and guarantee that it will be used only for peaceful purposes, and furthermore, the inability of the United Nations to do more than by-pass some of its elementary problems through the channels of diplomatic intrigue, make one appreciate more and more the truthfulness of Gen. MacArthur’s statement made at the time the surrender terms were signed in Tokyo bay on September 2,1945. Among other things he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Men since the. beginning of time have sought peace. Various methods through the ages have attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations. From the very start workable methods were found in so far as individual citizens were concerned, but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger international scope have never been successful. Military alliance, balances of power, League of Nations, all in turn failed, leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The utter destructiveness of war now blots out this alternative. We have had our last chance. If we do not now devise some greater and more equitable system Armageddon will be at our door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Admitting the total collapse of all human efforts of past ages to establish a permanent peace,'General MacArthur is aware of an impelling force driving this old world on to annihilation. In his pospf tion as an integral part of this world’s governments he no doubt feels this irresistible force in a particular way, as it is written in Revelation, chapter 16, verses 13 to 16: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs . . . for they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings [and commanders] of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. . . . And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fully admitting that this “battle of that great day of God Almighty” is at the door, one would think that such leaders would quickly abandon the Devil’s world organization and seek refuge on the side of the Theocratic organization of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An Item Luther Overlooked</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">AYS a subscriber: “Perhaps it will interest you to know that the Lutheran religion omits the same commandment that the Catholic religion does, and likewise splits in two the tenth commandment. See &quot;Luther’s Small Catechism’ by Dr, Reu of the Wartburg Publishing House, Chicago, Ill.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Those That Survived</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6"> TOTAL of 22,060,000 soldiers and civilians died as a result of World War II, a figure that taxes the mind to comprehend, But not all the millions of casualties that were victims of this war died; many millions continued to live out the rest of their lives (some short and some longer), some totally disabled and others crippled, all retaining memories that are like nightmares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Focusing attention on only one part of the casualty list, that of the American army up to the time of the defeat of -Germany, we learn that 96.1 percent of the wounded soldiers in &quot;the European theater were saved, through hospitalization, from what might otherwise have been a merciful death. Medical men were quite proud of this record and made</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">some comparisons between these figures and those of World War I. Only 1,200 died of contagious diseases this time, to compare with 23,000 in the first war with a much smaller army. Only 70 died of pneumonia. None died of typhoid-; while in the first war there were 166 'deaths as a result of typhoid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But other causes, novel to this war, took their toll in human suffering. Shortage of metal made the Germans turn to wooden bullets, which, though effective for only 100 yards, nevertheless caused nasty wounds. Upon striking bon&amp;s’these bullets splintered and scattered put in the tissues, and, being practically invisible to X rays, they could not .be located. It has been estimated that about 10 percent of those wounded were totally disabled. 11,000 amputation eases were reported up to the defeat of Germany, 77 percent of them leg amputations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And speaking of amputations, Milliard W. Bice thinks that other things besides arms and legs were taken from these men, that is, in many cases they . were robbed of their confidence in humanity. Said he, as quoted from the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> “The irony is that many of these disabled men who come back find that the world they fought to save no longer exists for them. They discover they can’t find jobs, that pensions often are inadequate and that the whole thing is pretty much of a mockery.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Ethiopia and the Famine</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">TARVATION gauntly stares hundreds of millions of people in the face, and world leaders continue to cry that, the supply of food is not sufficient, A pitiful situation indeed; And yet, at ■ the same time it is reported that Ethiopia has an abundance of food but is unable to supply it to the starving Europeans because of the squeezing pressure of Big Business and Power Politics of other nations in the so-called “brotherhood of nations”. Such facts change the famine situation from being pitiful to one of outrage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ When the world food conference was held in Hot Springs, Ga., in 1943 it was there known that Ethiopia was supplying the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation with large quantities of grain in the Middle East. Thereafter these supplies were terminated, but not because Ethiopia was not able, or willing, to continue to supply the grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the passing of months the world’s supply of food dwindled. Then, in the early part of 1945 Wynant D. Hubbard, acting chief of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation mission that was commissioned to visit Ethiopia, informed the proper authorities of Ethiopia’s ability to supply food for the hungry, but nothing was done about it. After relating these facts in a letter to the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> dated October 15,1945, Mr. John H. Shaw, as consul general of Ethiopia, continues and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is to be hoped the United Nations Food Conference at Quebec will do a little more than just look into the Ethiopian larder and </span><span class="font4">make some practical use of this source of supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ethiopia has untold and untouched rich productive soil that would quickly respond to scientific agricultural management with little effort and expense. There seems to be no reason other than thoughtlessness that these fertile resources have been neglected and left unproductive in a world so out of balance in nourishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In utilizing these resources it would accomplish the twofold purpose of assisting Ethiopia in her economic progress of rehabilitation and at the same time provide a source of food supply so urgently required to prevent starvation in undernourished countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Quebec conference came and went, the famine spread like a black cloud over 500,000,000, and still nothing was done to tap Ethiopia’s food reservoir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Honest people learning these things find it bard to believe that men who are trusted with the responsibility of looking out for the welfare of mankind would permit such things to eyist. Informed people, however, who know the behind-the-scene facts, are fully aware that situations like this do not just happen. They are deliberately created by big commercial and political interests who do not hesitate to sacrifice human life for their own selfish gain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Proving the Accusation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. One of those in a position to know the inside of this food shortage condition is David A. Talbot, an American citizen who is editor of the English-language monthly magazine, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ethiopian Review,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">published by the Ethiopian government. In a letter to the New ¥ork Times'on March 20, 1946, Mr. Talbot wrote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present situation has been brought about principally because of the bungling of politicians with the vital interests of the masses of mankind. The lesspns of it all should lift the sights of world leaders to the fact that if these interests are not made paramount in the new approach to world problems, we may perpetuate the same conditions which we set out to correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have just returned from Ethiopia, where, beyond doubt, there exists not only an enormous potential but a large surplus of some of the dire necessities which this urgent international enterprise calls for. Ethiopian grain is rotting while Europe starves and there is a great reservoir of meats and fats there which could be gathered in and be readily applied to the European larder. Geographically this African nation is not only within the European orbit, but it is not so far distant from the European Continent that these essentials could not be siphoned out to reach there in time to be of invaluable help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The world knows that His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie has continuously pledged to help in all international undertakings to bring about and maintain peace and security in the world. In this great hour of need Europe is welcome to the Ethiopian harvests, and even at a sacrifice the Ethiopian government would be only too glad ^o lend its, aid in alleviating * the famine. It should be pointed out that in theMiddle East <sub>t</sub> grain crisis of 1943 many, neighboring territories which suffered from severe famine were relieved by Ethiopian grain, which also saved millions af tons of Allied shipping space. Today, when the situation is in-all particulars worse, Ethiopian surpluses cannot be left out of the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Talbot then points out, with an accusing finger, those that are responsible for this artificially created shortage. Says he:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From my observation one of the reasons why Ethiopian surpluses are not utilized is purely political. It is the result of the political squeeze-play which has its roots in the desire of certain'of Ethiopia’s neighbors to -check her economic development and keep her ; a perpetual pawn of European diplomacy.' After suffering so terribly through Fascist aggression and occupation, her program of reforms and modernization set back and her <sub>t </sub>economy put off balance as a result, Ethiopia is struggling to set her social and political frame in order. The purchase of Ethiopian surpluses would aid considerably in providing revenue with which to carry on her program of reconstruction and rehabilitation and at the same time assist in relieving the famine in Europe. Or must power politics be wantonly displayed at the expense of the millions already crushed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the United Nations Food Conference held in this country in the latter part of 1943, Ethiopia, through its Vice Minister of Finance, pledged the resources of the empire in augmenting the world granary for the successful prosecution of the war. The present emergency is so appalling that it seems inconceivable that this offer should go abegging in the face of the cry for bread to save the people of Europe and parts of Asia from this grave crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the above it is obvious that Ethiopia is not at fault for this condition but is the victim of powerful outside forces. Frankly, the international diplomats, though remaining friendly with Ethiopia, are not interested in building her up to be a strong independent nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nor are the financiers of the world interested in Ethiopia’s cause. As pointed out, any surpluses purchased from that country will aid her in rebuilding her world trade, and, of course, Big Business of the stronger nations are not interested in doing that. They would not like to see a country like Ethiopia, where the prices of beef are “a third to a half cheaper than here?’ in America and “native labor is infinitely cheaper, plentiful and fairly good”, become a competitor in this postwar era after the present famine. No doubt the Chicago Board of Trade could explain why only a minimum amount of Ethiopian wheat has so far reached.the starving peoples of Europe.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Spirit in Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6">BOUT six thousand years ago the lungs of the first man breathed in earth’s atmosphere and the man awoke to life. It was the active force of Almighty God that caused man to inhale through his nostrils and to start the life processes of the human body to operating. “And Jehovah God formed man of the dust, of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> Later, when the same God created woman, He likewise breathed into her nostrils the breath of life, and she too became a living soul. (Genesis 2:18-22) God put in the man and woman the force of life, and this was sustained by breathing. Such lifeforce the man gave the name of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit </span><span class="font6">or, in Hebrew, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ruach.</span><span class="font6"> Isaiah 42:.5 says upon this: “Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which eometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit [rwach] to them that walk therein.” Because the Creator gives the power to man to breathe and this sustains the life-force of man’s body, the prophet Job was correct when he said: “All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach] of God is</span><span class="font6"> in my nostrils; my lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit” (Job 27:3,4) It would be only a ease of religious nonsense to think that “the spirit of God is in my nostrils” meant that a supposed “third person of the trinity” or “holy ghost” was in the nostrils of patient, suffering Job, whom three religionists were falsely accusing as a hypocritical sinner.—Job 2:11-13; 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The active force of life which all flesh enjoys proceeds from the Fountain of life. (Revelation 11:11) If Jehovah God were to withdraw it because men set their heart against Him, humankind would die. As Job drew near the grave, he felt as if God were about to take away his spirit or life-force. Said Job: “He breaketh me with a tempest, and multi-plieth my wounds without cause. He will not suffer me to take my breath [rwuch], but filleth me with bitterness.” Job knew that life depended upon God, and he said: “Who knoweth not in ail these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this ? In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath [ruach] of all mankind.” (Job 9:17; 12:9,10) How misplaced, then, is any confidence that is put in human rulers who promise to lead man out of all his troubles! “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach]</span><span class="font6"> goeth forth, he return-eth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” So says Psalm 146:3,4. The power of God to. give life and to take it away should be reason enough for us to trust in Him and to keep in unbreakable touch with Him. What if He should hide His face from us<sup>1</sup>? “Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takCst away their breath </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach],</span><span class="font6"> they <sub>z </sub>die, and return to their dust. Thou send-est forth thy spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach],</span><span class="font6"> they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.”—Psalm 1Q4: 29, 30; compare also Ezekiel 37: 5-10.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the coming battle of Armageddon, God Almighty will deal out. death to all worldly rulers opposing the rule of His Kingdom by Christ Jesus. “He shall cut off the spirit [ruach] of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.” (Psalm 76 :12) In the time of the resurrection under Christ’s thousand-year reign God will not send forth His spirit or life-force to restore to life any such as wickedly fight against His King during the battle of Armageddon. At that battle God Almighty will demand their life, and His Warrior King will execute them. “There is no man that hath power over the spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach]</span><span class="font6"> to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it,” “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach]</span><span class="font6"> shall return unto God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 8:8; 12:7) No fighters against God go to heaven, but are annihilated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religion has made its dupes to think that the spirit of life or the life-force in man is different from that of the lower animals; but on this vital subject does religion disagree with the inspired Scriptures. For truth on the subject we must accept what &quot;saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and form-eth the spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach] of</span><span class="font6"> naan within him”. (Zechariah 12:1) The Lord God caused the wise man to set down this eye-opening truth: “That which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one spirit; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth ?” (Ecclesiastes </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3</span><span class="font6">:19-21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.,</span><span class="font6"> marginal reading) Such likeness of man to beast God emphasized at the time of bringing in the deluge of Noah’s day, when He said: “Behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach] of</span><span class="font6"> life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.” “And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath [rauc/i] of life.” Outside of the ark, “all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach]</span><span class="font6"> of life, of all that was in the dry land, died,” . —Genesis 6:17; and 7:15, 22, marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If, now, we understand what the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit </span><span class="font6">is that is in man, as explained in God’s Word, we can appreciate what the psalmist meant in saying: “Into thine hand I commit my spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[ruach]</span><span class="font6">: thou hast redeemed me, 0 Lord God of truth.” (Psalm 31:5) The fulfillment of this came when Jesus hung upon the tree; concerning which Luke 23:46 says: “When Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.” Religionists confuse the spirit here with the soul, and say Jesus’ words prove the immateriality of the soul and its separate existence when the body is dead. They forget that Adam became a living soul, a material fleshly human soul, when God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. To he consistent, the trinitarians should argue that Luke 23: 46 proves that their “third person of the trinity”, the so-called “holy ghost”, was inside Jesus and that when He died He gave it up, and that the spirit He commended up to God and the “ghost” He gave up are one and the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Actually, whereas Jesus commended His spirit to His God and Father, Jesus’ soul or existence as a creature went to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hell or</span><span class="font6"> the tomb. It was left there only till the third day, on which day Psalm 16:10 was fulfilled, reading: “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” (Acts 2:24-32) On the third day; Christ Jesus came into existence again as a living soul by God’s resurrecting Him from the dead as His heavenly Son. Thus the Scriptures make a distinction between </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit,</span><span class="font6"> as shown at 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and Hebrews 4:12. &quot;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit,</span><span class="font6"> which He commended to God, was His life-force ot jjower of life.' That power returned..to God, who gave it to Jesus; and God alone could restore,' it'to His dead Son. God did so when He raised Him from the death state and restored Him to life as a living soul. The great Life-giver Jehovah safely kept that which Jesus commended to Him, because Jesus died in blameless integrity toward God and did not forfeit His right to everlasting life. The enemies were able by God’s permission to kill the body, yet they could not destroy Jesus’ right to life as a living soul and they could not obstruct God’s power to resurrect Christ Jesus to life as a living soul on the third day. Hence Jehovah God restored to Jesus the spirit of life or life-force on that third day.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Great Charter of Liberties</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">ODAY, when constitutional liberty is being attacked from within and without, it is good to remind ourselves that this is not a modern campaign to destroy freedom, but is a war that has been raging for generations, though perhaps with greater violence today than in former years. It is also good to remember that many victories have been won in this age-old struggle for freedom. One such victory occurred some seven hundred years ago, during the reign of King John of England. It was June 15 in the year 1215 when that most famous document known as the Magna Charta, meaning the “Great Charter” of liberties, was signed. Nowadays in many churches the-third Sunday in June is set aside in commemoration of that victory for human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are only four copies of the original Magna Charta in existence today, the most nearly perfect being known as the Lincoln, so named after the cathedral wherein it had been kept up to the time of World War IJ. Another copy was V<sup>e</sup>Pt i<sup>n</sup> the Salisbury cathedral, while the two other copies were deposited in the British Museum. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In August 1939 the Lincoln copy was brought to the United States by the Queen Mary and was put on display at the New York World Fair, where it is estimated that 10,000,000 people got a glimpse at this notable manuscript. When Britain entered the war it was decided that this famous document should be turned over to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., for safekeeping until hostilities in Europe ended. Now the Magna Charta is safely back in England making the return trip aboard the Queen Elizabeth sealed in a special ease made of zinc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is worth noting that after the United States entered the war the Magna ■ Charta together with.the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the Gutenberg Bible were secretly removed from Washington to Fort Knox in Kentucky. This is significant because the Magna Charta is so often spoken of as the “forefather” of the Federal Constitution, the Americah and British Bills of Rights, the American Habeas Corpus Act and the Declaration of Independence. Certain provisions of the Magna Charta, and even some of its words, are woven into the United States’ Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover the influence of this ancient document is reflected in constitutional provisions of other countries that have fashioned their governments after the American model. Even the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations is an offspring of the Magna Charta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With such a lineage it would be well {o go back and see whence this “granddaddy” of constitutional charters sprang. In the early part of the thirteenth century the totalitarian dictates of King John were running to an excess and the people were greatly oppressed. After much effort a confederation of the nobility of England together with the yeomanry and peasantry arose and forced the hand, of John to sign a treaty that</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">amounted to a sixty-point grant of freedom. The historic place where this occurred was “in the meadow which is called Runnymede, between Windsor and Staines”, on the bank of the Thames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Magna Charta, though it was based on a former charter signed by Henry I about the year 1100, went much farther in its purpose. Many of the provisions of the charter of 1215 were for the purpose of checking the tyrannical power of the king. Other stipulations were for the pufpoge of putting an end to the abfises of taxation. Also there were other provisions for the benefit of the people at large. Some of these might be called maxims of just government that are applicable everywhere, at all times and places. Says the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font6"> “The 39th article contains the celebrated clause which forbids arbitrary imprisonment and punishment without lawful trial. This article contains the writ of habeas corpus and trial by jury, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">most effectual securities against oppression which the wisdom of man has devised.”</span><span class="font6"> Thus the foundation for the security of English political liberty and personal freedom was laid, and hence the Magna Charta is spoken of by some authorities as the very foundation of our present-day liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Papal Bull Against the Charter</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like modern dictators, King John could not be trusted, and it was quickly shown that his word and signature were worthless. He was a Catholic dictator like Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. Hardly had the ink on that worthy parchment dried when John began maneuvering his forces to destroy the very things that he had sworn to uphold. A bloody conflict during the next few months raged until his death the following year, 1216,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When it is stated that King John was a dictator of the same caliber as Hitler, Mussolini and Franco it is done with understanding. For, true to type, dictator John appealed to the pope for aid and help to crush the newly-granted </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">freedoms of </span><span class="font6">the people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Immediately </span><span class="font6">Pope Innocent III denounced the Magna Charta in a special bull. Says the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia:</span><span class="font6"> “By a Bull dated 24 August at Anagni, Innocent III revoked the charter and later on excommunicated the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rebellious</span><span class="font6"> barons/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why is it that when oppressed people try to secure for themselves basic rights and protective measures against </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">cruel </span><span class="font6">religious-political dictators they are </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font6">ferred to as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">rebels#</span><span class="font6"> Because this is an old Hierarchy name applied to all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font6">rise up in protest against their authoritarian rule. A modern example is found in Spain. There the freedom-loving democratic people were called “reds” and “rebels” because they resisted bloodthirsty Catholic Franco, who slaughtered millions of innocent women and children in order to stamp out the Magna Charta principles in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, the pope’s cause in England was not as successful as in modern Spain. With the death of John, in 1216, the Great Charter of Liberties was reissued with some changes. Later on as constitutional government developed other changes were made, in the years 1217, 1225 and 1297. But there is one thing that makes the original Magna Charta outstanding as a historical document, as stated in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica:</span><span class="font6"> “By the charter [of 1215] all the gfeat principles of constitutional government were affirmed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And because of the “principles of constitutional government” therein set forth the pope issued a special bull declaring it “null and void” and excommunicated those who sponsored it. It should be expected, and indeed it is very manifest, that the pope and his Hierarchy fight, and will continue to fight desperately, against all traces of constitutional governments that have sprung from the Magna Charta. So be on your guard 1 all you who love freedom. Never relax your vigilant watch over the fundamental freedoms set forth in the Great Charter of Liberties.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Incredibly Rich Illinois</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">LLINOIS, with its 56,400 square miles of the richest garden lands in the world, and its 7,897,241 population, is surpassed in population only by New York state and Pennsylvania. The '* ground is so level that the state has one 4 railroad with a stretch 100 miles in length that is without a curve. Besides, there is huge lake and river transportation, the largest railway center in the world, and a deposit of bituminous coal underlying more than one-half of the state. The soil is incredibly rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chicago Board of Trade is the center of the grain trade of the world. Five days in the week, from 9:30 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., 1,500 members buy and sell the grain of the world in units of 5,000 bushels, which, roughly speaking, is about five carloads. Imagine, if you can, 1,500 men shoving the prices of grain up and down in every part of the world, and most of it done entirely with the fingers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The buyers and sellers can tell at a glance, by the way a man holds his hand, whether he is a buyer or a seller, how many units of 5,000 bushels are involved, and the price that is offered or accepted. Suppose the blackboard price is 98 cents; a man holds two fingers vertically, then horizontally, with the palm outward: that means that he is offering to sell 10,000 bushels at 98j cents a bushel. Prices are adjusted in one-eighth cent movements. When<sup>1</sup> the offer is on the even cents basis the fist is closed; if the forefinger alone is extended that means an offer of one-eighth of a cent; the forefinger and middle finger, an offer of onefourth of a cent; the three last fingers, three eighths; the four fingers, one half; the whole hand, with fingers and thumb extended, five-eighths; the whole hand, with fingers and thumb pressed closely together, three-quarters; and the fist with thumb extended, seven-eighths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When an order is filled, confirmation is flashed back to Kansas City, New York, San Francisco or Canada, and in actual practice it<sup>1</sup> is usually less than sixty seconds before the confirmation is flashed back to the Chicago grain pit. Every sale influences the price; so does the weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Religious Racket</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As long as four hundred years ago, the archbishop of Toledo, Spain, was making $1,200,000 a year out of the racket which he operates. His income now is only half that amount, but with the common people about him starving it seems to' be about the best (or worst) he can do. In Chicago they are still going strong, or making a bluff at it. One of the most recent swindles is the proposition that you must pray to one Thomas More, who is stone-dead, or to another dead man, a Mr. Ives, in order for the law courts to function properly. Almighty God would certainly have nothing to do with Chicago’s so-called Red Mass, not because He is jealous at the prayers being offered to Messrs. More and Ives, but because, the whole mass idea is absolute blasphemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, The Protestants know there is something wrong, but, having no more use for the Bible than the Red Mass crowd, they don’t know what it is. At the University of Chicago the professor of theology, Bernard E. Melan, told 125 pastors that the main characteristic of the American church is its mediocrity. Said he:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Its music, its architecture, its prayers, its purist talk and its celebrations are all mediocre. The influence that emanates from its doors, through its ministry and preachments, spread mediocrity like a deadening blight over the life of the communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Trying to get away from mediocrity, and also from the Bible, the “Reverend” Clinton C. Cox, pastor of the Drexel Park Presbyterian church, Chicago, aped the “Very Reverend” Ernest William Barnes, bishop of Birmingham, England, by proposing the murdering of what the clergy term imbeciles. The way “Reverend” Cox put it was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We could say that since immortality is such </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">glorious thing, then the death of these would give them an immediate entrance into eternal life, saving many years of useless and unnecessary suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Campaign to Stop Quacks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A dispatch from Chicago says that Protestant, Catholic and Jewish theologians are organizing to put a stop to other quacks putting on religious programs and getting maybe $200,000,000 a year for nothing. That’s an idea. Suppose now that these misguided quacks should start to operate “eternal torture” and “purgatory” swindles. What a shaine that would be! for any honest Bible student can readily prove that both are absolute lies. The idea of broadcasting the truth about the Bible, and not asking anybody to contribute one red cent, is limited to Jehovah’s witnesses: they are the only ones to practice it, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another big' idea of the combined theologians is to get 300 churches to spend two years in ringing all the doorbells in Chicago, to get the people back into their ecclesiastical prisons. It won’t work. The only people that will ring the doorbells will be Jehovah’s witnesses. They are not trying to get the people into cages. They are engaged in the blessed work of feeding the Lord’s starving sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Champaign, Ill., Mrs, Vashti McCollum, mother of - three children, asked the court for a writ of mandamus ordering the school board to prohibit religious education classes taught in the Champaign public schools for the past five years. She states that her ten-year-old son, Janies Terry McCollum, has been persecuted by his schoolmates because he was the only child refusing to get his head full of some of the religious nonsense which the others were coerced into receiving. She states that these religious classes in the Champaign schools violate both the Illinois and Federal constitutions. And she is right. The clergy come back with the wail that Sunday has become a day of visiting and recreation, and the schools have expanded their recreation hours, and so, if they are to live without doing any honest work, the only way they can discern is to horn in on the student’s time and the state-levied taxes, and grab some portion of the normal school day for their sectarian purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">“For the world .as a whole, a food crisis has developed which may prove to be the worst in modern times. More people face starvation and even actual death for want of food today than in any war year, and perhaps more than in all the war years combined.” So said President Truman on February 6 of this year as he outlined a program, for reducing the food consumption of the American people-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wheat must be conserved if a major famine is to be avoided. So the Government ordered flour mills to make what is called an 80-percent extraction flour in</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Life” from Bending</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">stead of the 72-pereent extraction flour they had been milling. In Britain during the ivar an 85-percent extraction flour was made. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font6"> has pointed out' that this new 80-percent flour will have fewer vitamins and less calories than the former artificially enriched flour. There will be about half as much thiamin, or vitamin Bi, and less riboflavin, the pellagra-preventing niacin. These could be added but this might give rise to both legal and technical problems, it. is pointed out. Digestive difficulties too may be encountered in using this nevt flour, as was the case in Britain when they used an 85-pereent flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> Aside from regulations on milling there are<sup>1</sup> restrictions on the amount of wheat that can he used by distilleries ■ and as livestock feed. There are also .other measures in the conservation program aimed at curtailing waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the great wasters of bread is * mold. It is claimed that at least 140,000,* 000 pounds of moldy bread is thrown away annuallyi To prevent bread from molding before it reaches the consumer commercial bakers have for some time dumped quantities of chemidal compounds into their bread and cakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More recently it was discovered that if bread is exposed to high-frequency electronic heat for five seconds it will not mold for at least three weeks under ordinary conditions. Nutritive values and taste are said to be unaffected by this treatment. This is an interesting discovery and will, if instituted as standard bakery practice, cut down on bread losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truman’s Famine Emergency Committee said that their aim is to reduce consumption of wheat 40 percent. In order to accomplish this they made thirty-nine suggestions. Topless sandwiches and coverless pies were a couple of their recommendations. This forces people to eat less, or if their appetites cannot be appeased they have to eat' more of other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conserving Flour at Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wheat and flour may be saved indirectly by using up every bit of dry bread. A person who designates herself as an “Old Housekeeper” wrote to the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> in answer to .another housekeeper, not so old, who claimed it was necessary to throw away one-third of every loaf of bread because it was stale. Said the “Old Housekeeper”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Has she never heard of toast, better made with not-too-fresh bread? Or bread pudding, made with sugar, eggs, milk and raisins? Or bread crumbs, used for coating veal or pork ehops before cooking? Or stuffing for fowls? Or French toast, where slices of stale bread are dipped in a mixture of milk and egg, fried ’ in margarine and eaten with cinnamon and sugar or syrup? Or cheese fondue—slices of bread in a casserole with grated cheese between slices, covered with an uncooked custard of milk and eggs and baked? Or bread pancakes—dry bread soaked a minute, beaten up with a little flour, baking powder, eggs and milk and cooked on a griddle? Delicious, all of these!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another way of conserving wheat flour is by substituting other grains for it, whether in whole or in part. This idea has prompted a baker in New York city to put on a campaign which he calls “Bread-of-the-Week”. For three months he will supply two different types of bread each week, or twenty-six varieties all together. Some of his formulas include the following items: an all-milk loaf made with a combination of white &lt;flour and whole-wheat; a bread on the sweet side made with sweetened condensed milk; honey-sweetened cracked wheat bread; an oatmeal bread made with cut oats; bran bread; and a raisinegg bread. Another type is a heavy and chewy bread called peasant rye, continental in style. Also old-fashioned brown bread. Also, there is, an old-time dark bread that will stand up under the hardest day’s work. This is made with whole wheat and whole rye, oats and cornmeal, sweetened with molasses and of a consistency that cuts like cheese. But watch out, this bread is hard on store teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other styles included in this “Bread-of-the-Week” series are: Swedish limpa, a rye bread made with orange juice, pulp and rind, scented with cardamom; cinnamon bread heavily sweetened, fine for toasting; potato bread made with mashed potatoes blended with wheat flour ; and cheese bread made by adding grated cheese to the flour base in place of mashed potatoes. This cheese bread does not require butter, and when toasted—oh, yum, yum! pass another slice!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Holland Dutch bread topped with streusel, whole-wheat bread with dates and nuts, whole-wheat bread ‘ with raisins and peanuts, and whole-wheat bread with pitted prunes are other varieties. And then there is a holiday loaf with a variety of nuts and faults that will win anyone’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These combinations will suggest to housewives and cooks many ways of conserving wheat flour and substituting Hours from other grains like corn, barley, oats, rye and soya beans. Ground-up , popcorn is also being mixed into broad dough by a commercial bakery as a substitute for wheat flour. Squash muffins also will take the place of bread at any meal. They are so easily made. Mix the dry ingredients together: flour, salt, sugar and baking powder. Then sep</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">arately beat up the eggs, but instead of adding milk, mash up cooked squash and mix it with the eggs in place of the milk. Add no other liquid; the squash takes its place. Lastly mix in the shortening and drop in muffin pans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just leave it to the ingenious housewives to find ways and means of conserving wheat flour. They will not depend too much on this new “Famine Flour” that is low in quality and low in nutritive value, high in chemicals and high in price, hard to obtain and hard to digest. They will consider these suggestions and will add thereto their own novel creations. In doing so wise housewives will keep the'“staff of life” from bending under the present emergency '’and their families will continue healthy and happy.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Symphony Orchestra</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">N THE Chateau de Moutiers in France</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■in the year 1.581 a performance of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ballet comique de la Beyne</span><span class="font6"> was given in which the dancers themselves played musical instruments. That was what might be called the parent of orchestras as we have them today. It differed greatly from our modern conception of a symphony orchestra, but still it was a start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the time of that small beginning there have been many changes and improvements in orchestral arrangement and organization during the last 350 years. Today a large, well-balanced orchestra consists of 90 to 110 instruments capable of presenting symphonic works and compositions of serious artistic worth undreamed of in the sixteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A symphony orchestra as di stin-guished from a military or street band, is made up of four distinct groups of instruments. First, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">strings.</span><span class="font6"> This is by far the largest and most predominant part of an orchestra. It is composed of the first and second violins, violas, violoncellos and contrabasses. The second group, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woodwinds,</span><span class="font6"> are made up of flutes, oboes, bassoons, clarinets, piccolos, English horns, double bassoons and bass clarinets. The third group is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">brass,</span><span class="font6"> with its horns, trumpets, cornets, trombones and tubas. And the fourth part of the orchestra is referred to as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">percussive.</span><span class="font6"> This group is dominated by the drums and cymbals, and also includes the triangle, celesta, glockenspiel, tambourine, castanets and xylophone. Other instruments, such as the harp, are sometimes used in orchestral arrangements for particular effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each of these groups, except percussion, can play full harmony in themselves. However, the all-surpassing power and highest expressiveness of an orchestra is obtained by combining the individual members of the different groups together and having each contribute its own particular timbre to the richness and full body of the whole. It is only by bringing together and using many and varied instruments that the larger kinds of concert music, symphonies and overtures, can be properly performed, as well as furnishing the exalted accompaniment demanded by operas and oratorios.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The many instruments that find a place in the orchestra of today have behind them each a history of its own. The xylophone is from a very primitive instrument used by native tribes. The trombone is a descendant of the old sack-but used by the Hebrews and Egyptians. The kettle drums were brought from the Far East by the Crusaders. The piccolo is a “baby” flute. And the bassoon, the bass of the oboe group, because of its comical quality in the orchestra, is sometimes referred to as the clown or joker instrument. Even the majestic violin is a development from an earlier instrument called a “piccolo violino”, which had* a shrill and piercing tone. Under the hands of the Amati family and their pupil, Stradivari, the beloved violin with all of its melodious qualities was finally produced. Many of these changes in the instruments themselves were made during the early part of the seventeenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was also during the seventeenth century that under Louis XIII of France the famous orchestra arose known as “Twenty-four violins of the King”, That string orchestra, which is spoken of as the first </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font6"> orchestra, consisting of alto, tenor and bass violins, reached its height of accomplishment during the reign of Louis XIV. People from England, Germany, Italy and elsewhere came to hear the concerts of that orchestra conducted by Lulli. It was during this period of time that the general interest </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the opera was stirred up throughout Europe. Opera houses were built in the principal cities, the best musicians were sought, and orchestras sprang, up and flourished everywhere. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then during the next two centuries, the eighteenth and nineteenth, the greatest advances in the orchestra were made, and this was, to. a large degree,, due to the talent and efforts of composers who prepared and designed the compositions used by the musicians. Men like Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber, Berlioz, Tsehai-kowsky, Liszt, Wagner, Strauss and Debussy, each in his turn, contributed to the development and improvement of the symphony orchestra. And the efforts of these men were lasting, too, and can be seen and enjoyed in the concert halls today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The forming of symphonic societies has also done much to perpetuate the orchestral institution. In 1813, 133 years ago, the Royal Philharmonic Society of 'London was founded. On the Continent the Vienna Philharmonic began its career in 1842, and eleven days later, in the middle of April, the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra had its first performance. The Boston Symphony dates back to 1881; the Berlin Philharmonic, 1881; the Chicago Symphony, 1892; and the Philadelphia Orchestra, 1900. And within the last fifty years throughout Europe and America cities of any consequence have formed their local symphony societies for the benefit of music lovers of their communities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some may think, after listening to Beethoven’s Fifth or Ninth Symphony, that the symphony orchestra has reached its zenith of perfection. That may be true in this world, which is more concerned over lethal A bombs than it is with peaceful music. But in the New World of righteousness, with its Theocratic rule which will shortly replace this present evil world, men and women will reach a level of perfection in body and mind equal to that enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Eden. In such a condition it is not likely that they will enjoy the present works of imperfect creature^. Rather, they will be inspired to compose and play orchestral music to which even the angels of heaven will delight to listen. Symphony orchestras then will make the very vaults of heaven ring with music of exaltation all to the praise and glory of Jehovah God’s name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Diligenti quintuplets, born July 15, 1943, in Argentina, are reported as alive and well. Three of them are girls and two of them are boys. The chances of survival are everywhere greater for girls than for boys; so say the statisticians on the subject. All five of the Dionne, Canada, quintuplets are girls, and they also are in good health. They were born May 28, 1934, and so are about twelve years of age. The total weight of the Dionnes at the time of their [premature] birth was 11^ pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In itself good evidence that man was designed to live forever, it used to be said of him that he was born with about 2,000,000,000 brain cells, of which only about 2 percent are ever developed. Nowj with improved apparatus for seeing and counting, it is claimed that there are 10,000,000,000,. and the late Doctor George Crile estimated that the number might run as high as 4,000,000,000,000,000. These four quadrillion brain cells . (if there are that many) are all interconnected, and the number of possible connections is so stupendous that it is claimed it would take thirty 350-page books just to publish the number, provided anybody had time to make the calculation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the brain' of man is in itself so wonderful, what about the remainder of his marvelous organism? Lord Rutherford, British scientist, put it in this wise: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A few years ago the lie detector was going to change everything. Experience shows that it does nothing of the sort and is absolutely untrustworthy. The American Psychiatric Association states that the findings are wrong in about 30 percent of the cases. It has been discovered that hardened criminals resist its findings quite successfully. Lie detector findings are not admissible as evidence in court, because they are obtained under duress. Even if the lie detector operates accurately, the evidence thus - obtained is no more trustworthy, than an ordinary confession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who have for years protested against the vicious and nonsensical vivisection of the lower animals have ' been certain that in due time this form of sadism would break ou{ against man, and it has done so, with unimaginable horror. Herman Goering issued orders to freeze prisoners at Dachau in every conceivable way and then make efforts to revive them; also, to keep a complete record of every case, which was done. In the coldest winter weather the victims were immersed in ice-cold water, and left there until death impended. Then they were taken out, given hot baths, and each</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">man was made to nestle against two naked gypsy girls. The naked girls did no good, but the hot water did, and some were saved from death by this means. It was'discovered that for an hour and a half after withdrawal from the freezing water the body temperature con-$ tinued to drop, and as much as five degrees. Some survived after they had been so frozen that their ordinary blood temperature of 98° had fallen as low as 86°. Who would suppose that for any conceivable reason men would do such devilish things ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a whole, American health is not as good as might be imagined. Of the men of military age about 40 percent were found unfit for duty as soldiers. Of those , inducted into the army 1,500,000 were treated for dental defects, impaired vision, syphilis and hernia. In the first two years there were 14,50Q,000 cases of various kinds treated; there were 31,-. 000,000 dental fillings, 6,000,000 teeth were renewed and 1,500,000 bridges and dentures were provided. Five years before the war, a public health survey disclosed that there were then 23,000,000 Americans afflicted with some chronic disease or physical disability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The suggestion seems reasonable that the United States would be better off if it had as many bathtubs as it has automobiles, and if it could provide sewage disposal for the 2,800 incorporated communities that still have to get along with conditions as primitive as they were everywhere 400 years ago.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE year is 1894. Not yet has the boycott, bludgeon tactics of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy caused the newspapers to. stifle their honest opinions and render them nothing biff praise. Not yet are the publishers of books in fear that what they publish may offend Rome. Not yet has the fifth column of Catholic Action seeped into positions of power with the political and educational systems for the purpose of putting'“religion” in the schools, the Catholic brand, to keep America and her schools from being “Godless”—America, whose very founders fought for freedom to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience, not to have religion forced on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this year of 1894, two historians, Katherine Coman and Elizabeth Kendall, published a book setting forth, honestly and fearlessly, facts.of history that today would be slapped over lightly by many a publisher. In the foreword by one of the authors, we note these words: “We shall . . . pay slight attention to the deeds of kings and potentates, that we may give more attention to the deeper influences at work.” Excerpts follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the thirteenth century the political power of the papacy was boundless, but secular interests had been secured at the expense of spiritual influence, and men were turning away from a Church controlled by worldly ambitions and considerations of material advantage. [Even then!] In England resistance to the authority of a political Church was strengthened by the national hostility to papal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">interference.</span><span class="font4"> [Page 95]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Henry III was “deeply religious, moral, refined . . . but . . . vacillating and weak, he showed himself throughout his reign incapable of fulfilling the' wishes of his subjects or carrying out a vigorous policy of his own. His rule was characterized by misgovernment at home and inefficiency abroad . . . both devoutness and personal gratitude bound Henry to the pope. Self-interest, too, led him to connive at the papal exactions in return for papal support in his dealings with his subjects”. [Pages 98, 99]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lazy, Shiftless Religionists</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This picture of the world, as it looked to an honest priest, would be incomplete with-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">out the pious rout of monks and friars, pilgrims and palmers, that go to Rome, to do honor to the saints, and return with 'leave to lie all their life after”; wanton hermits, long-legged lubbers, who, being too lazy to ' work, wear a celibate’s habit and live at their case; friars in plenty—all the four orders— preaching to the people for their own profit, interpreting the scriptures to suit their own purposes. In their midst stands a pardoner, armed with a.papal bull, and professing to have power to absolve men from falsehoods and broken vow's. The ignorant people believe him and throng to his feet, bringing rings and brooches, and hard-earned pennies to pay for the pope’s indulgence. [Page 129]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religious war raged on the continent, but by skillfully balancing one party against another, while committing herself to none, Elizabeth kept England at peace. An ever present danger was the Catholic party. [Page 182]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wiclif had ably seconded the endeavor of Parliament to restrict the privileges of the pope and the English clergy, arguing that sueh power and wealth were inconsistent with the teachings of Christ. The essential feature of Wiclif’s reform was the endeavor to recall the Church to Apostolic Christianity. Since God had revealed himself as the Redeemer of men, each human soul might have access to the divine life and was, responsible to God alone. The mediation of the priest was unnecessary, and the ecclesiastical hierarchy with its pride and its greed for power was a fungus growth upon the Church of Christ. The claim of a sinful pope to act as vicegerent of Christ was blasphemous. No authority could be legitimate that was not sanctioned by God. Ruler and priest alike held of him. Obedience need not be rendered nor tribute paid to an unrighteous lord, though he be the king himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wiclif {Stood for the Right</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such doctrines quickly called down upon Wiclif the condemnation of the ecclesiastical authorities. The Friars raised the first cry of alarm. Their hypocrisy and immorality had excited the indignation of Wiclif, and they had writhed under many a scathing denunciation at his hands. Now his bold utterances against the papal supremacy gave them opportunity for revenge. Courtenay, Bishop of London, the champion of, clerical privilege and sworn foe of John of Gaunt, summoned Wiclif to defend himself against the charge of heresy, Lancaster maintained his cause, and the citizens of London made a demonstration in his behalf; but the attack was renewed and he was finally condemned by a synod of the clergy. The last eight years of Wiclif’s life were overshadowed by persecution so persistent, so formidable, that a feebler spirit would have quailed before it, but he maintained undaunted confidence in God and in the truth as he saw it. The faith he defended grew clearer while he argued. Pardons, indulgences, pilgrimages, were one after another declared of no avail. The climax was reached when he boldly denied the doctrine of tran-substantiation, the corner stone of priestly authority. At this his friends wavered. John of Gaunt protested and withdrew his support. The Peasant Revolt, which broke out at this inopportune moment, was attributed to Wiclif’s subversive doctrines. The condemnation of the synod was at last accepted by the university, and the great teacher was obliged to withdraw to his parish church at Lutterworth. Here, as if despairing to accomplish reform by the aid of princes and learned men, he devoted his energies to translating the Bible into the speech of the people and training disciples—his “poor priests”—who should perpetuate his message. In 1384 he was summoned to Rome to defend his doctrines before the pope, but a stroke of paralysis rendered the journey a physical impossibility. He sent a written statement of his faith, saying, “I joyfully admit myself bound to tell to all true men the belief that I hold, and especially to the pope; for I suppose that if my faith be rightful and given of God, the pope will gladly confirm it, and if my faith be error, the pope will wisely amend it.” These were bold words to address to the tribunal where heresy was more hateful than sin. The Vicar of Christ immediately recognized in the advocate of. poverty and righteousness an archenemy of the Church of God. Wyclif died before the pope’s anathema could reach him, but the sentence was executed without delay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His doctrine was denounced as heresy, his writings were condemned, and his poor body, exhumed from Lutterworth churchyard, was burned by the common hangman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not so, however, was the work of the great reformer undone. The students of Oxford cherished his memory and the people secretly revered the valiant advocate of the rights of man against iniquitous privileges. His “poor priests” became most zealous evangelists. They are described in a contemporary statute as “going from county to county and from town to town, in certain habits, under dissimulation of great holiness; preaching daily not only in churches and churchyards, but also in markets, fairs, and other open places where a great congregation of people is”. The writ-' ings burned in accordance with papal decree were reproduced with marvelous rapidity and copies of Wiclif’s Bible were furtively read in the houses of the nobility, in the court of the king.”—Contributed from Kentucky.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Dixie Sees the Difference</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font6">OME of the level-headed people of Dixie Land are beginning to see the difference between Christianity and religion ; and it’s a big difference, for they are diametrical opposites, Christianity is the truth and religion is a lie. Here is how J. F. Yarbrough puts it in a letter <sup>1</sup> to the Montgomery, Ala., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About fifty years ago German “cultur” was the envy of most of the civilized nations of , the world. Most of the educational and ministerial leaders of the United States were completely captured by this fallacy. Great numbers of American youth were sent to Germany to window-dress their education with perman “cultur”. Most of the educational, and ministerial leaders were so impressed with this “cultur” they devised means to thoroughly saturate American, youth with this particular brand of education. The plan was the exchange of professors by the universities of Germany and the United States. Very soon after this plan was consummated nearly all American universities had on their roster of teachers a German professor. German “cultur” was and is camouflaged atheism. To prove this is true, pretty soon after the exchange of professors, articles began to appear mainly from educational and ministerial sources on “Higher Criticism”. Boiled down to its last analysis, “Higher Criticism” was an attack upon the integrity and authority of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. As an evidence that the real men and women of America have little* use for such a transparent fraud, Mr. Yarbrough went on to say that, because of the conditions just named, at the last General Conference of the Methodist. Church “2,983 ministers reported not a single member received by profession of faith during the past year”. That is common sense. Consider the bare facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No one is a Christian unless he is a believer in and an obedient follower of Jesus Christ, his Master and his Savior, and Jesus Christ gave unqualified endorsement to the Bible when He prayed </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 81, 1946 '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to His heavenly Father for His followers, saying, “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” Now, why would any sane man or woman, who knows that there is no other name given under heaven or among men whereby they may be saved, entrust their eternal welfare to any man, whatever he may cal] himself, who has no faith in Jesus Christ’s honesty or truthfulness? If Jesus believed the Bible to be the Word of God, and He did, and so confessed, and the clergy do not believe it to be that, and so confess, why would anybody with an ounce of brains follow them to his own destruction? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Clergy Disbelieve the Bible &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The gentleman, J, F. Yarbrough, who puts the Alabama preachers on the spot, seems to know all about them; for he goes on:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a District Ministers’ Retreat held in Alabama a paper was read by one of its members in which he said, “The Bible is not a reliable moral guide. It is not the Word of God.” The ministers present endorsed the paper and by resolution asked the Alabama Christian Advocate to publish it, which it did. The annual conference following the publication of the paper seems to have tacitly endorsed it by not unfrocking or even censuring the ministers participating in the attack on the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After, saying, “Today a very small percentage of the young ministers can be found who have not a question mark in their minds as to the integrity and authority of the Bible,” Mr. Yarbrough furnishes the information that the board of education of the Methodist Church places in the study course of every Methodist ministerial student in America a book by one of the Fosdicks which teaches thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That all we know about Christianity and God was borrowed from pagan records. [Pages 23 and 30] That the Old and New Testa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ments abound in contradictions and cannot be historically trusted. [Pages 33 and 54] That both man and God are the products of evolutionary processes. [Page 199] That . miracles are but legends. [Page 56] That Christianity borrowed its idea of the existence of. a devil, eternal punishment, angels and • miracles, fyom the Persian religion and other ’ superstitions. [Pages 77, 188, 189] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evil Spirits on the Job</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Demons are at the bottom of this state of affairs, and are doing everything pos</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sible </span><span class="font6">to bring the Bible into disrepute. It is well known to Bible students<sup>1</sup>^ that verses 9-20 of the last chapter of Mark’s gospel were added by some later writer, since they do not appear in any of the oldest Greek manuscripts. It is therefore wrong to use Mark 16:18 as a basis for human conduct. It reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They will take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly poison, it will not injure them; they will lay hands on sick persons, and they will be well. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover, (A.V.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At a religious meeting (mistakenly called a revival meeting) held in La Fol-'lette,‘Tenn., Johnnie Hensley was bitten by a rattlesnake which he handled oh instructions from a “clergyman” whose business it was to know better. Hensley died in two days, and if he had taken a drink of poison he would have died from that just as readily as he did from the .snake bite. What a responsibility the clergy have to learn the truth about God<sup>r</sup>s Word and declare the truth to the sheep in their care! If Hensley had known the truth about that passage he might be alive today, and not rotting in his grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is plenty of religion scattered </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">around. It </span><span class="font6">was a favorite saying of the showman, P. T. Barnum, that “the American people love to be humbugged”, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">this saying seems borne out by the do</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">idgs at Sarasota, Fla., winter quarters </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30 </span><span class="font6">for the show which still bears his name, before it goes out to entertain the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only one-seventh of the American people are Roman Catholics, but each year, before the big show takes to the road, it takes a Roman Catholic priest an hour and a half to bless the big tent, the acrobats and the train crews, and it is all just pure nonsense, absolute buncombe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally some politician gets religious, and when he does one has to pinch both nostrils tight to keep out the odor. At Atlanta the ODT was too pious to sanction Sunday delivery of milk, and the Georgia Producers’ Federation had to pour a thousand gallons of this vital food down the sewer. In his wisdom the ODT man responsible for this display of brilliance should have the cows lined up in front of him so that he can reproach them for producing milk on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Politician Religiously Qualified</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Senator Bilbo is a graduate of three Americap universities and seems to have had enough religion pumped into him, so that if he ever did have any common sense he is now without it. When a group of highly educated and highly placed Negroes (two of them attorneys) called on him in his official capacity to insist upon passage of a civil rights and a suffrage law for the District of Columbia, the senator from Mississippi said to these spokesmen for their 11,000,000 fellow Americans:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Negroes ean only hope for continued practice of discrimination and oppression after the war; and Liberia is the place where they must settle to obtain security and equal opportunity, not America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lt is too bad that Senator Bilbo does not take a little time to read up and see what Negroes are doing in spite of the peanut statesmen sent from his home state. Now speaking of peanuts, it used to be thought that a sack of fresh roasted peanuts was a big product all by itself, but under the careful study of a great</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Negro chemist, Dr. George W, Carver of Tuskegee Institute, some three hundred different products have been obtained from this one, and many of them are of great interest, value and importance. “Olive” oil, machine oil, soap, “lard,” paint, cloth, are a few. Would Bilbo have sent Dr. Carver away? If so, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of America’s leading Negro scholars is Dr. W. E. B. DuBois, educated at Fisk, Harvard and Berlin universities, and holding honorary degrees from Atlanta and Howard universities. This gentleman has lectured at most of the important universities and colleges, as well as at international gatherings in London, Paris, Brussels, Geneva, Lisbon and Japan. Would Bilbo s$nd Dr. DuBois away? If so, why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bilbo has a faculty of keeping his mouth open and busy while his brains sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Bilbo could have the whole 11,000,000 Negroes sent back to Africa whence they w’ere enslaved, how does he think the hard work in the south would be done? Take, for instance, the loading and unloading of vessels. At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., forty-five Negroes w<sup>T</sup>ere arrested falsely charged with vagrancy. About half of them were longshoremen and their bank accounts proved the truth of their claim to that effect. Yet these men, longshoremen and all, were “fined” $35 each by the sheriff, without ever having a day in court. Suppose now one of the sheriffs in Bilbo’s state would want to rob 45 laborers $35 each and there were no colored victims to rob, because they had all been shipped back to Africa; why, he might have to perform only the legitimate duties of his office and earn his living by honest work!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>“S. D. A. Leaders Surrender to the Catholics”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6"> HUNDRED years ago the Seventh</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Day Adventists, refusing to walk in the light, drifted backward. Now their leaders no longer know what to teach to others, or what they believe themselves. This is brought out by leaflets at hand entitled, “S. D. A. Leaders Surrender to the Catholics.” The burden of complaint is that the principal publication office of the sect, located at Takoma Park, D.C., since 1903, set about to build a library. This they had a perfect right to do. They spent $80,000 on their library. They had a right to do that, also. When the library is stocked with books, it is bound to have a great number of anti-Catholic books, because one cannot be a Seventh-Day Adventist, and adhere to the hundred-year-old teaching of William Miller, founder of the denomination, without holding the Roman Catholic system in utmost disesteem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though William Miller made mistakes, yet he accepted the Scriptural truths that the dead are dead, awaiting reAirrcction. He knew that the doctrines of “inherent immortality of man”, and of the “trinity”, and of “purgatory<sup>7</sup>” and of “eternal torture”, and of the worship of the virgin Mary, and of the whole setup of popes, cardinals, bishops and archbishops as practiced in the Roman Catholic Church, were entirely wrong. But when the present-day Adventist leaders dedicated their new library they had as their principal speaker Dr. Roy J. Deferrari, general secretary of the Catholic University of America. And they had three other prominent Roman Catholic leaders on the speakers’ platform at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For yourselves know perfectly fwhat all the religionists, including S.D.A., have overlooked] that the day of the Lord so comcth as a thief in the night. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day,”—1 Thessalonians 5: 2, 4, 5.</span></p>
