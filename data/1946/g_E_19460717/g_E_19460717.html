<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Comforting Mourners</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ On my first call the woman said: “I am a Catholic, and I do not want you to call again.” But not forgetting the apostle Paul, who had once been an ardent religionist, I approached the house the next time in the territory. To my surprise, the woman said: “Well, it’s you again. I thought I told you not to come here any more. Anyway I'll take that book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand”},</span><span class="font4"> but I do not want you to bother me.” One cold day I decided to make another attempt to speak to this woman. When I rang the doorbell she stepped into the hall.but would only speak to me through the glass. I was wearing a kerchief and indicated that I could not hear what she was saying. She opened the door and invited me to step inside. Then it was that I could tell she was in trouble, and shortly she began to explain to me how her mother had died just a few days before. One thing that bothered her was that her little boy wanted to know where his grandmother was and she told him “Cone to heaven”. But she did not seem to believe this her-, self, and then confessed that she knew very little about the Bible and would like me to conduct a study in her home so that she would know the truth. It was near lunch time and I was invited to stay and have lunch with her and the boy, who would soon be home from school. To this I readily consented, and shortly the boy arrived. “Mother, whose rubbers are those?” he asked. “There is a young lady in the front room who I want you to go and speak to. I told you a lie the other day when I said grandmother had gone to heaven. Go and speak to her and she will tell you from the Bible where your grandmother is.” Now I have a book study at this home, , and once more it has been demonstrated that the Lord blesses persistent effort in accord with Theocratic instructions.— Canadian Kingdom publisher.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Replacing Republics with Dictatorships</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">T IS the ambition of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which is itself a selfperpetuating dictatorship, to do away . with every republic, and put in instead dictators that will do its will. When dictators disappear and republics take their place, it is always a time of trial for the meh that manage Catholic affairs. This was illustrated in the remarks of Cardinal Faulhaber, made to the Munich Catholic Congress in August, 1922. Speaking of the flight of Kaiser Wilhelm to Holland, and the rise of the German Republic, he said of the honest effort of the German people to govern themselves, “The revolution was perfidy and high treason and will go down in history forever with the mark of Cain.” Cardinal Faulhaber was never against Hitler. When the paper-hanger was launching his ship of destruction of that same republic, the cardinal said, “We .are fighting for our rights within the Nazi regime and not against it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a similar spirit of hatred for republics, and love of kings and dictators, the German bishops, at the height of Hitler’s career, sent him a message expressing their “sincere readiness to cooperate to the best of their abilities”. In 1935 the bishops instructed the people of the Saar to vote unanimously for the return to Germany under Hitler, and they did so; in 1936, when Hitler invaded Spain the bishops congratulated him on his fight against the Spanish Republic. In January, 1937, they repeated the compliment and- promised their aid. In the summer of 1940 they announced that after Hitler had gained his objectives there would be special ceremonies of^ gratitude to the German troops and expressions of loyalty to Hitler. In the autumn of 1943 the bishops stated that Hit-ler.’s war was a heroic struggle to protect the homeland from Bolshevism. Instead, it was merely a part of the Vatican plan to grab control of the world. Hitler was unable to fulfill his mission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Particularly rank was the pastoral letter of all the German Catholic bishops on the opening of World War II:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this decisive hour we admonish our Catholic soldiers to do their duty in obedience to the Fuehrer and to be ready to sacrifice their whole individuality. We appeal to the Faithful to join in ardent prayers that Divine Providence may lead this war to blessed success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pope and Hitler Worked Together</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the spring of 1933 the German Government and the Vatican concluded their concordat. Four years later, in the spring of 1937, when he was getting ready for World War II, the then pope issued his encyclical “Mit Brennender Sorge” so as to keep Hitler toeing the line. The Spanish war had then been under way less than a year. The pope was greatly interested in this, and it is common knowledge that without Catholic Hitler, Catholic Mussolini and Catholic politicians in Britain and America (or at least politicians susceptible to Catholic pressure) the Spanish Republic would be in existence to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is well known that the two men that did most to put the concordat across were the present pope and Franz von</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Papen, one of the defendants at Nuremberg. For </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font4"> share von Papen received the highest Papal decoration as “Defender of the Faith”. Koeves, in his biography of von Papen, said: “The Concordat was a great victory for Hit-'•_ler. It gave him the first moral support *he received from the outer world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After Hitler’s inauguration von Papen declared: “This is the order which is also approved by the pope . . • the new regime which is anti-liberal and antidemocratic must enjoy our complete and unrestricted confidence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nothing can change the fact that von Papen is a pious Catholic. So are’ or were Seyss-Inquart, Degrelle, Laval, Petain, Anton Pavelich, Tiso, Dollfuss, Seipel, Hitler, Thyssen, Salazar, Suener and Coughlin, nor can the fact be erased that when Hitler was on the toboggan, headed for destruction, and the draft for the German people’s Home Guard army was made, the only members of the clergy, Protestant or Catholic, that were exempted were the Jesuits, whose child Hitler -was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A secular paper, published in London, caustically observes that.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Vatican remained silent when the victims were being hustled into German murder vans. The Vatican remained silent when the corpses were removed from the ovens of Maidenek and Oswieeim. The Vatican remained silent when the rocket bombs fell on London, remained silent while millions of innocents were murdered, remained silent while Hitler, applied his doctrine of “divide and destroy” to entire nations. But when the attempt on Hitler’s life failed, the Vatican broke its silence. Without delay, it sent a message of congratulation on Hitler’s miraculous salva</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>:</sub> When </span><span class="font4">Germany collapsed it was natural that Russia should control the eastern part, where her troops were in </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">possession, </span><span class="font4">while the other Allies would get the west. It -fell to the United States to receive the most Catholic part, and therefore the most difficult section. Its first appointments in Catholic Bavaria were characterized by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New Republic </span><span class="font4">as “turning over the Bavarian people to . the Vatican and political reaction”. The United States zone in Germany, with its 13,308,000, is estimated to be 53 percent Catholic; the British zone, with its 22,650,000, is estimated at 42 percent Catholic; the Russian zone, with its 24,234,000, is estimated at 15 percent Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four months, after the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New Republic’s </span><span class="font4">charges, seemed to have changed matters, for when the Catholic bishops met' at Fulda, as they always do in August, they got “let down” in good shape. The world’s least<sup>:</sup> competent advisers, they composed a letter to General Eisenhower making suggestions as to how his branch of the work could be better done, and, according to a copyrighted dispatch in the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Press,</span><span class="font4"> the “military government refused to transmit the letter and returned it to the bishops”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to Austria, it is a matter of history that when Cardinal Innitzer, of Vienna, knew that Hitler was about to seize his country he ordered the church bells to ring out a greeting to the Nazis and sent a letter to the Nazi gauleiter assuring him of his wholehearted cooperation, and that of the other Austrian bishops, and wound up his letter with the words “Heil Hitler”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is quite evident who betrayed Czechoslovakia. The “Reverend Father” Tiso and Adolf Hitler split the country in half, with Tiso himself in charge of the eastern half and responsible for the murder of thousands of Jews done to death by the Hlinka guards. Captured by U. S. troops, Catholic bishops urge his release from prison. Hitler was pleased that 10,000 church bells were turned into cannon for his use. This is a new role for church bells: they ordinarily awaken people, but in this new “service” they put persons to sleep, in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four months after the war was over the Czechoslovaks raided a monastery at Tepla, arrested the abbot and 14 monks, and took over two radio transmitters, twQ field telephones and a quantity of munitions.' The monastery had been a center of Nazi activity for years, and had kept in touch with their comrades in Bavaria. If the Catholic bishops at Fulda want to tell other people how to run things, why don’t they run their own crowd properly?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mussolini and Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia had much to do with starting World War II. He himself was described by the pope as “a man sent by Providence, devoid of liberal prejudices”. This was another way of saying that Mussolini was a man without principle, which is just what he was. Cardinal Schuster was so pleased with the gangster assault upon Ethiopia that he said grandiloquently and falsely, “On the fields of Ethiopia the Italian flag carries in triumph the Cross of Christ, breaks the chains of the slaves, and makes straight the way of the missionaries of the Gospel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pope recently commented on an Italian law limiting the political activity of priests : “The Catholic Church will never allow itself to be closed within the four wails of a temple. Separation of religion from life, or of the church from the world, is contrary to the Christian and Catholic idea.” Maybe, instead of this judgment of the pope, you might like to have a word from your Savior on the same subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as 1 am not of the world.—John 15:19; 17:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite all its stubbornness the Vatican has to do some yielding. Thus a dispatch from Rome to the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> discussing the fact that six months after the war ended the Fascists still had a large share in running things in Italy, had this remark: “The Vatican had its own little purge today when Archbishop Angelo Bartolomasi, head of all chaplains in the Italian Army, was forced to resign after violent press attacks accusing him of Fascist sympathies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Noteworthy Dispatches About France</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is perfectly obvious to every student of France’s affairs that the real reason why Hitler took such an easy walk through France, and clear down to the Pyrenees, was that he had the backing and active assistance of the French clergy. There now<sup>r</sup> follow two dispatches. The first of these is from the radical New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Labor Action</span><span class="font4"> of October 30, 1944, and tells the truth just as it is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Immediately after the Germans ■were driven out of Paris, one o£ the first demands of the French underground was addressed to the Vatican, asking for the removal of the archbishop of Paris, Emanuel Celestine Cardinal Suhard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since the fall of France, although many of the lower clergy aided the underground, the cardinal and his bishops worked openly with the German fascists and their agents, Petain and Laval, The cardinal aided in organizing the Vichy troops to be used against the underground, and was on the most friendly and confidential terms with the German high command. When thousands of Frenchmen were forcibly taken to Germany to slave for the Hitler w<sup>r</sup>ar machine, he showed his approval by assisting the Germans even more than in the past. The cardinal and Petain worked closely on many matters of state, and in many of the Vichy governmental offices in France and abroad the cardinal had one of his bishops assisting the Vichyites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The feeling against the cardinal and his bishops is so strong that on August 26, when de Gaulle was to attend services at the Cathedral of Notre Dame, he notified the cardinal and the Rev. Beaussart, Archbishop of Notre Dame, that under no conditions must they appear at the services. The message was taken</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">*to the cardinal by Father Bruckberger, a Dominican priest who is a member of the underground. Bruckberger, in an interview with t Helen <sub>F</sub> Kirkpatrick of the Chicago </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Daily </span><span class="font2">* News, told her that the cardinal answered “I do not understand how the new government can begin in this anti-religious way”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Vatican understands that if the French people can force the resignation of the cardinal and many of his bishops, the whole question of the Vatican’s collaboration with fascism will begin to come out into the open. So for that reason Archbishop Spellman‘of New York was sent to France, and he, as a representative of the United States, tried to use pressure to keep the cardinal at his post.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Archbishop Spellman’s role during the past year has become quite obvious. On his trips to Europe he spends all of his time at the Vatican and visiting Franco in Spain. Although his post is military vicar of the United States armed forces, he does not visit many of the army posts nor do we ever see him touring the camps in the Pacific. He appears at the Vatican and in the cities where the higher clergy is in trouble with the people for supporting Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These attempts to whitewash the Vatican and the higher clergy are tied up, of course, with the attempts to keep the workers of Europe from cleaning house of all collaborators in industry and the government as well as in the higher clergy. Because when the house cleaning begins the Vatican knows that a real good job will be done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Compare the above statement of facts with the following untruthful and hypocritical statement sent out by the Religious News Service, published in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> 18 days later, to offset it. Without a reasonable doubt, it was written by a Jesuit and intended to pull the wool over the eyes’ of Americans so that they would draw the erroneous conclusion that France is full of Protestants, and that'the priests there are not politicians merely, but are really &quot;ministers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Paris (Religious News Service)—Liberation of France is creating a new phenomenon in social life—participation of clergymen in French politics. Priests and pastors are serving on local liberation committees throughout the freed areas and are holding other civil posts of importance. They are called upon to exorcise moral authority in settling disputes, and many liberation committees led by pastors have been able to calm passions and avoid violence. Inclusion of Protestant and Catholic ministers on committees of liberation was first urged in 1943 ,by the French Provisional Committee in Algiers in recognition of the part played by the clergy in the resistance movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spain and Its Little Dictator</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time when Hitler was pushing along through southern Russia toward the shores of the Caspian sea, an Allied observer visited Franco, in his private apartment. He saw on .his desk an autographed picture of Pope Pius XII, and on either side of it were inscribed photographs of their fellow religionists, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. A year la-' ter, the picture of the pope was the only one that remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pope makes no bones of his affection for the man that perjured himself and betrayed the Spanish Republic. He thinks that was just right. On November 19, 1945, he broadcast a nine-minute address in Spanish to the Spanish people and at the end'of'it extended a papal benediction to Franco, and to his political and religious comrades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Professor Harold J. Laski, of the British government, is one of the few politicians that have the courage to mention the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as at the bottom of Spain’s troubles. Speaking by radio from Britain to a Madison Square Garden rally he taunted the Roman Catholic Church in Spain as desiring to remain a rich monopolist at the expense of mass poverty; he taunted the statesmen of Britain and America with their fear of the hostility of the Vatican if they dared support a Spanish Republic, and he put th.e heat on both kinds of hypocrites by saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our peoples didn’t make the immense sacrifices of this war to perpetuate either a tyranny like that of Franco, or an unedifying mythology like a Vatican-sponsored King of Spain trying hastily to learn the vocabulary of the Four Freedoms while making it painfully evident that he finds no meaning in the words. It is time that the democratic powers become the trustees of democracy. It is time that they regarded their trusteeship not as a thing of which they’re ashamed but as a thing of which they can be proud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hierarchy was greatly incensed at the Laski broadcast. It does not like to have people tell the truth about Spanish conditions. A Catholic Englishwoman, Mavis Bacea, went to Spain to see conditions for herself. When she saw too much she was thrown into a concentration camp, where she stayed eight months. While in there, she states, she saw 20 pious Catholic guards torturing the breasts of a nude girl with lighted cigarettes and saw pregnant women relieved by abortion so that they could get on with their appointed tasks. Why does not the pope mention some of these things in his broadcasts to Spain? He lacks the intestines necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chile and Colombia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On May 12, 1945, the “Reverend Father” Jose Maria Caro, archbishop of the Catholic Church at Santiago, Chile, seems to have been connected in some way with a mass held for Benito Mussolini at the Catholic Temple of National Gratitude. Four persons were arrested and several were injured in disorders that followed. The archbishop seems to have been rewarded for his Fascist sympathies. A year and five days passed away and a -wireless came through to the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> that Caro Rodpiguez, archbishop of Santiago, Chile, has been made a cardinal. It doubtless is the same gentleman, the difference in surnames following a Spanish custom of sometimes indicating the name of the mother of a distinguished personage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pope seems to apprehend that an educational campaign is under way in South America. In a broadcast to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">Catholic congress at Bogota, speaking in Spanish and of Jesus he said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Bishops sometimes get caught when carrying on their seditious work against republican forms of government. In-its issue of March 12,1946, the Des Moines </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font4"> contained the following Associated Press dispatch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Manila, Philippines (AP)—A Catholic bishop of Manila was among hundreds of Filipinos accused of treason in people’s court Tuesday as special prosecutors rushing to meet a March 15 deadline brought total indictments to more than 3,400. Cesar Maria Guerrero, auxiliary bishop, was accused of placing his imprimatur on a seditious Japanese-sponsored magazine, of urging intermarriages with Japanese and of praying for Nipponese victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As late as December 19, 1945, Lombardo Toledano, Mexican labor leader, stated that on December 4 he had submitted to the Mexican government exact data and convincing proofs that the Sinarquist Union, a Catholic organization, was receiving smuggled arms from the United States, with a view to putting Ezequiel Padilla, a candidate for the presidency of Mexico, into office by force of arms. If thus placed in office he would, of course, be merely a dictator, subservient to those who placed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact,</span><span class="font4"> in its issue of February 11, 1946, has the following as its leading headlines: “(Copyright; Exclusive) Suppressed Dept, of Justice Document First Evidence Father Coughlin Was Paid '-Nazi Agent.” The story occupies the entire issue of that courageous publication, issued by George Seldes and published at 25 Astor Place, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is less than seven years since Coughlin’s Christian Front conspired to grab the United States government. The Brooklyn leader Cassidy, with others of the gang, was booked to blow up the United States Custom House, the General Post Office and the Federal Reserve Bank, their . thought being that they would cause conditions here to become similar to those then prevailing in Ger-<sub>%</sub> many, where a demented paper-hanger, ' backed by the “Church”, really thought that he could grab the world. When the FBI investigated the Christian Front outfit they found a number of arsenals containing bombs, rifles, ammunition, powder, dynamite and arms stolen from the arsenals of the National Guard, but the gang went free. Of course, since the discovery of the atomic bomb, all that stuff looks like the playthings of a child not yet permitted outside of the nursery, but it was serious enough in 1939-1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We shall have to wait to see, but others besides ourselves have noted the strange, foreboding fact that the institution which most loudly claims to represent Christ in the earth is the one that is most persistently devoted to suppressing democracies, and has even taught little children to think that it is a mortal sin to be a liberal, i.e., to have regard for the rights of the common people, the poor, to whom Jesus said He was specially sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a special dispatch to the Buffalo </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span><span class="font4"> the columnist Edgar Ansel Mowrer inquired whether, if Roman Catholics should become a majority, they would permit himself and other dissenting minorities the full exercise of all the rights which the Roman Catholic minority (15 percent of the population) now enjoys. We can tell Mr. Mowrer that the answer to his question is emphatically </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">No.</span><span class="font4"> All they desire, according to their own oft-repeated statements, is to get in full control and they would absolutely kill anybody that would dare write as Mr. Mowrer writes. Here is what he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Italy I watched my former acquaintance, Achille Hatti, as Pope Pius support Fascism against the liberal Italian monarchy, suppress the Catholic democratic Partite Popolare to please Mussolini and receive in exchange a concordat, a restoration of temporal power and a considerable sum of money. The Vatican condemnation of Fascism came only some years later. In Berlin in 1932 and 1933 I watched with horror the democratic Catholic Center Party slowly abate its resistance to the Nazis, with Msgr. Kaas, its titular head, yielding to arguments from Rome until the final capitulation to Hitler. In Spain, in 1936, I spoke with Spanish clergymen who outlined with indignation the pressure they were under “from above” to support the Fascist usurper, Francisco Franco. And again, in France, in 1940, support of the anti-Republican forces by a large section of the Catholic Hierarchy was visible and avowed. These instances, I submit, were too systematic to be accidental. The Vatican was supporting Fascism against democracy. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Up to the Neck in Clover</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ If as alleged, Rexford Guy Tugwell, governor of Puerto Rico, lives in regal splendor in a castle upon which $500,000 was spent in one year for repairs alone; and on top of that has, at government expense, eight automobiles at his disposal, and thirty household servants, and his necessary household expenses; and on top of that has a salary of $10,000 a year, then it would seem that he has fallen into clover up to his neck. He is generally regarded as a good administrator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If all this is true, as alleged, he seems</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to have been more clever than General Jorge Ubico, president of Guatemala, who lost his job because he boosted his salary up to $150,000 a year. Despite that, he was considered a capable administrator, developing highways and airports, fostering primary education, and eliminating some graft and some crime. He held his job as president for 13 years and 5 months.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Parochial Training Resultants</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HREE parishioners of St. Dominick’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Roman Catholic Church, New York city, attended mass, or at least the first part of the mass, then slipped out and into the priest’s garage and stole from his car his radio and a clock worth $100. One of the lads was 16, and the two others were each 20 years of age. These boys had been improperly educated. It is wrong to steal, even from a priest, and the boys should have been taught that. The London </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> was indiscreet enough to boast that in the last fourteen years out of 108 electrocutions of murderers in the Huntsville, Texas, state prison, 87 went out of this life Roman Catholics. That is a little more than 80 percent in a state in which less than 10 percent of the people are Catholic. This seems sufficiently clear as to the wrong education the’se boys received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Men and boys that have been parochially educated have strange ideas about things. Thus the Associated Press had a copyrighted dispatch in the Corpus Christi, Texas, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> having reference to some goings on in San Mateo, Mozo-quilpan village, Mexico, reading:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Catholic residents of the village in near-by Mexican state were summoned by the unaccustomed tolling of the bells of their church. When they gathered, unidentified persons incited them to attack the homes of local evangelists, members of a Protestant sect. The demonstrators dragged numerous evangelists into the street and beat and stoned them. Police authorities quickly restored order. No arrests were reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This all seems regular. The bird with his collar turned backwards that rang the bell and incited the mob is unidentified, but the mob does his will and there are no arrests. The same system was used at St. Bartholomew’s massacre, and always before and always afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Occasionally there is a slip and news gets out about the priests that, if the system w’ere perfect, would not be permitted. Here is one that appeared in the Scranton </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Priest and Nubse Are Found Dead in Apartment in West</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Los Angeles, Nov. 18 (U.P.)— Police chemists today analyzed capsules found in an apartment beside the bodies of the Rev.' Gustavo Gonzales, twenty-nine, Catholic priest, and Isabel Hernan, thirty-six, nurse. Both appeared to be poison victims, officers said. Eunice Hager, nurse and friend of Miss Hernan, told police Miss Hernan telephoned her asking her to come to the apartment immediately for an emergency. The priest was dead and the nurse dying when she arrived, Miss Hager said. There were three glasses near by, two containing ginger ale, and a number of capsules. An uninailed letter written by Miss Hernan said she and the priest were married secretly four years ago at Mexico City. They met at Los Angeles General Hospital where she was employed and he was making sick calls, the letter said. The priest was an assistant at St. Vibiana’s Cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Public School Wrecking Department </span><span class="font4">♦ It is very interesting that the wrecking of public schools has become a considerable industry; also, that no parochial schools are ever wrecked; also that the names and religions of the boys doing the wrecking are concealed from the public; also that parochial pupils</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">have done immense damages to Protestant churches and Jewish synagogues. It all hangs together beautifully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On a Sunday night in the summer of 1944, three youths broke into a public school in the Bronx, smashed glass in doors, poured ink and glue on books, '* tore the principal’s record books, and * took a fire axe and demolished four new typewriters, besides several filing cabinets and book cases. Estimated damages, $2,000. Eight months later, three nine-year-old boys broke into a public school in the East New York section of Brooklyn, and they were not students of the public school which they destroyed. In 21 classrooms they hacked desks and other furniture, smashed window panes, mutilated pictures, set small fires and chopped the keys and wires of a'grand piano. Estimated total damages, $5,000. Who put them up to it? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Who?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Saint Thomas Out for the Long Green (?)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font4">ERTAINLY 'Saint Thomas the Apostle’, if you can believe “The Messenger” put out by his church in Kansas City, is not in the religious business for his health. The first remark is about the bingo party and drawing; that smacks of money. The third remark is about the sale of tickets in the parish; that also smacks of money. The fifth remark is also about the sale of tickets, and the remark itself states that it was a “financial success”. The seventh remark says of the work of the bingo ticket sellers, “About $400 will remain after expenses are paid.” The next item advertises, “The next event, Fall Card Party in November.” </span><span class="font4">Thus, out of the first nine items in the church paper six have a financial aspect; for it is reasonably certain that I plenty of money will change hands at the card party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no information at hand as to ' just how much “Saint Thomas” charges for masses now. When he w’as on earth he did not know anything about them; neither did anybody else; for they are not mentioned in the Scriptures. But the next item says, and you can be sure there was money in the back of the head of the man who wrote the appeal, “In yotir charity pray for the repose of the soul of James Shea and Ed Mason.&quot; Looking ahead in the paper it appears that for James Shea masses w’ere sold to two families, for delivery on Monday </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">Friday. James is stone dead, and the money which the Girten and Broil families paid for these masses is worse than thrown away. The Ed Mason masses were sold to five different groups, for delivery on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The five groups also paid for something that is absolutely worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The little paper explains that “St. Thomas Church needs a new set of Black Vestments, Chasuble and Dalmatics. Perhaps you may be thinking of a memorial gift in honor of your deceased parents or relatives”. That has a money ring to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has often been noticed that although Catholics comprise only one-seventh of .the population of the United States, yet they have a great share of the orphan asylums. It was Mark Twain that noticed that a seemingly natural arrangement ■was a monastery on one hill, a convent on the next one, and an orphans’ home in between. Anyway, “Saint Thomas” asks for $350 toward the orphans’ building fund.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The paper doesn’t say how much is necessary to get a “Plenary Indulgence”, but gives this information:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Do you know (1) there is a -Plenary Indulgence attached to making the stations of the croSS; (2) An additional Plenary Indulgence applicable to the souls in purgatory when you make them on the day you receive Holy Communion. (When you gain a Plenary Indulgence it means that all temporal pun-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">isliment due to sin is removed from the soul.) This is a wise investment—it benefits yourself and also the souls in Purgatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inasmuch as there is no such place as &quot;Purgatory”, all the money that is taken in to keep people from staying there too long is all clear velvet. And, to tell the truth, it does not sound like Thomas, but like the one mentioned in &quot;Ezekiel 28:18:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thou hast defiled thy. sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shaft be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Foremen Are Human Also</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">S</span><span class="font4">OMEBODY is always discovering something new<sup>7</sup>, and it seems that Robert H. Keys, who used to be a foreman, has discovered the fact, and announced it, that foremen are human, the same as other workers. The National Labor Board didn't seem to have that idea, according to the columnist Peter Edson, but they probably have it by now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Mr, Edson, Mr. Keys is young, married, well-educated, gentlemanly, grammatical, and industrious, and Edson goes on:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He was, he says, sick and tired of seeing good foremen in the Detroit area called into the office, handed a check for a couple weeks’ pay and summarily fired. He was tired, too, of seeing the ways in which labor was sometimes kicked around, and of the ways some labor didn’t give management a good day’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is always best to get out of the way of a young man with an idea. Mr. Keys thought it would be well to get the foremen together, and so he organized the Foremen’s Association of America, and has already made history with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Did you notice that when John L. Lewis wanted to raise the wages of the soft coal workers, the mine foremen wmre placed in the very center of the whole controversy?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Looting the Libraries</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">B</span><span class="font4">ECAUSE a German soldier was shot in a near-by street, the Royal Society Library in Naples was burned to the ground. Because each bookplate in the Louvain library showed the burning of the.university in World War I, the whole 900,000 books in the library were burned in World War II. And, for no reason at all, the Jewish Theological Seminary in Lublin, together with its books, was burned. Sixty to seventy percent of all Polish libraries were destroyed, or their contents, or selections therefrom, were carried elsewhere. The libraries of Russia were 'winnowed of their best books. The same was done with between 500 and 600 libraries in Yugoslavia, with 411 in Czechoslovakia, and similar ransackings </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 17, 1MB</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in Greece, Luxembourg and Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses stand for free education of those who are being destroyed for lack of knowledge, and so they resented all this, as also the seizure of a fifth of world art, found hidden among Nazi loot, in 530 secret hiding places in Germany. The Toronto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font4"> had this to say<sup>7</sup> in its issue of June 2, 1945j under the engaging title “Bible Students Save Art”. What United States paper, tied hand and foot by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, would have either the honesty<sup>7</sup> or the courage to give Jehovah’s witnesses such notice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A collection of 25 to 30 tapestries and 50 pictures looted from Holland by Himmler and re-looted by liberated Russian and Polish</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">slave laborers, has been recovered through the efforts of German “Bible Students” who spent six years in prison for their religious beliefs, stated Lieut.-Col. Geoffrey F. Webb, British chief of monuments, fine arts and archive sections of supreme headquarters at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These Dutch treasures had been installed in a castle at Wewelsburg that had been used *by Himmler as a sort of finishing school for his Black Guards. The freed slaves raided the castle, making off with the treasures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Five members of the International Bible Students’ Union, who had been imprisoned in a tiny barbed-wire enclosure near by since 1939, appealed to the Russians to return these “treasures of mankind” and stood guard until British troops arrived. Before they left Himmler’s elite guards had set fire to the castle, evidently to prevent the return of the treasures to their rightful owners.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Why Sunday Schools Have Failed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">R</span><span class="font4">ELIGIOUS leaders have expressed great concern over the fact that Sunday school attendance has fallen off considerably during the last two decades. Comparison between statistics of 1944 and 1928 show that enrollment dropped about 4,000,000 in the Protestant Sunday schools. A candid examination of both the origin and present-day purpose of Sunday schools will show that the causes for this trend are not superficial, hut are rooted in the system’s very history and foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Sunday schools were of divine origin and arrangement, and had God’s approval, then surely something would be written in the Bible concerning the same. But, shocking though the news may be to honest believers in the system, still the fact remains that nowhere in the Sacred Record is reference or inference made to an institution like a Sunday school as we know it today. It was centuries after the canon of the Bible was completed with the falling asleep of the apostles that Sunday schools came into existence, and therefore it is necessary to refer to secular history, which is rather hazy on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font4"> says that Carlo Borromeo, a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church who lived from 1538 to 1584, .“may also be regarded as the founder of the modern Sunday school,” As to the Protestant schools the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font4"> says that “Robert Raikes established his first Sunday school in Gloucester, England, in 1780”. (The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Americana</span><span class="font4"> says that it was in 1781.) Continuing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Britannica</span><span class="font4"> says: “The idea, however, did not originate with Raikes. Among earlier pioneers in this field were Joseph Alleine, the Puritan Rather, who founded Sunday schools in England in the 17th century, and John Wesley, who held Sunday classes in Savannah, Georgia, in 1737. Yet, by reason of his achievements in organization, Raikes is justly regarded as the founder of the English Sunday school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia </span><span class="font4">adds its testimony when it says: “It is not difficult to determine, from the history of the times, who was probably more instrumental than any other man in establishing and diffusing the system of gratuitous and Christian instruction in those schools. It was the Rev. John Wesley, who, for more than thirty years prior to the first Sunday-school of Raikes, had been in the habit of assembling children in various parts of England for the purpose of religious instruction.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first Sunday school union in London was formed in 1803, and in 1824 the American Sunday School Union was organized. It was in 1872 that the uniform international Sunday school system was. set up. When attendance reached its peak in 1928 there were only 29,000,000 enrolled throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These historical citations testify to the fact that the Sunday-school idea originated wnth men, and not with God. Men, and not God, established Sunday schools for the purpose of teaching religion, which consists of creedal dogmas and doctrines founded upon the traditions of men and not on the truth of the Bible. Today many people wonder whether such practice should be continued. “Kev”. Philip M. Widenhouse, member of the Federal Council of Churches, has said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are many who feel that the presentday church school is on its way out and Protestantism should be devoting its attention to the “teaching function” of the church, recognizing that Christian principles were taught long before the modern Sunday school came into existence, and may be taught long after it has ceased to be. Pessimism regarding the future of the Sunday school is certainly grounded in fact, for at the present rate of loss the Sunday school will cease to be within thirty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is not to he wondered at when one sees how far Sunday schools have failed to fulfill their original purpose as expressed by John Wesley. On July 18, 1784, he wrote, “'Who knows but some of these schools may become nurseries for Christians?” Instead of producing genuine Christians, it is an admitted fact that Sunday schools have had another goal and purpose. Dr. Jesse M. Bader expresses it thus: “Sunday school teachers have the greatest job in the community because they are making Christian bankers, Christian statesmen and Christian civic leaders.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now, what is a “Christian banker” or a “Christian statesman” or a “Christian civic leader”? To be a Christian </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in fact,</span><span class="font4"> and not in name only, would require one to be a follower of Christ Jesus and His teachings. Did Christ aspire to be a banker or a statesman or a civic leader? No, He did not. He divested himself of His heavenly riches and glory and took on the form of a servant born in the humbleness of a manger. As He grew He learned the carpenter’s trade (not banking and politics). Though He possessed power and ability as a perfect creature far above imperfect men about Him, yet He did not strive after material wealth and position; He had not where to lay His head. This is the example Christ Jesus left for true Christians to follow.—Philippians 2:5-8; Matthew 8:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to Christ’s teachings, what did He say about rich men and political statesmen ? First of all, He told the rich young ruler if he w<sup>T</sup>ould get life he should sell all of his possessions, give to the poor and then follow Christ. He could not be a servant of mammon and also a follower of Christ. Would it not be harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than it would be for a camel to go through the eye of a needle? Christ said that His kingdom was not of this world of political intrigue and diplomacy. (Luke 18 :18-25; John 18: 36) Moreover a faithful follower of Christ Jesus, the apostle James, said that if persons claiming to be in a covenant with God are friends of this world, like many politicians and statesmen, then they are spiritual adulterers and fornicators, and as such they are the enemies of God. To this James added his warning of what is in store for rich men of this old world. (See James 4:4 and 5:1-6.) It is because Sunday schools have endeavored to incubate and hatch such pseudoChristians that they are without God’s blessing and have come under ITis condemnation. The failure of Sunday schools is due to the fact that they are of human origin and are institutions founded for the purpose of promulgating the traditions of men. Howmver, condemnation is upon them because they have failed to heed God’s warning that He sent to them, but instead have persisted in their self-appointed business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Failed to Seed God’s Warning</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1904 a book was published, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The New Creation,</span><span class="font4"> and over 900,000 copies were distributed in the most important languages. On page 544, under the heading “The Influence of Sunday Schools’’, three reasons were given to show that | these systems of men are not Scriptural* ly founded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) The Sunday schools have been injurious to Christian parents, in that they have led them to consider themselves relieved of the parental responsibility placed upon them , by the Lord. The Sunday-school teacher is often thoroughly incapable for such a responsibility, often a novice as respects children and their proper training . . . Such a teacher is given the place of the parent in respect to the most important of all parental duties. (2) The Sunday school is a decided disadvantage to the children of Christian parents, because they do not get from the Sundayschool teachers the kind of instruction which the intelligent and conscientious parent could and should give. (3) The Sunday-school arrangement is reacting disadvantageous^ upon both parent and child from another standpoint: it is causing the children to lose respect for their parents . . . Undoubtedly it has much to do with the present-day condition of the so-called “Christian world”, in the matter of disobedience to parents, family insubordination, etc, . . . if he [the child] sees the parent’s veneration turned from God and his Word and directed toward a clerical class, so as to receive supposed divine messages through them, and without the exercise of reason or the study of God’s Word, the influence upon the child is that of superstition and subordination to priestcraft—an unhealthy condition as respects spiritual development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Should I Send My Child to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunday School?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the minds of many parents, even parents who themselves never attend church, the question arises as to whether they should send their children to Sunday school or not. This very question was asked, and answered from the Bible by a book called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font4"> Since its publication in 1941 nearly 3,500,000 have been printed; so, no doubt, many have it on their bookshelves. It states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Shall the child be sent to the Sunday school of some religious organization to there receive instruction? No; for the reason that religious organizations do not teach the Bible, which is the way of righteousness. If the parents love their children they must and will 'instruct them at home in the Word of God and will take their children with them to the class or company where the Bible is carefully and systematically studied, and there require the children to sit quietly and learn; and when they have advanced sufficiently they will let the children participate in the study. Such is the rule which God has made known, and that is the only proper rule to follow. The rule or rules which God made known to the Israelites, his typical chosen people, apply to all persons who enter into a covenant with God to do his will. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What, then, are the rules which God has announced concerning the parents and their responsibility to teach their children </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font2"> Let the Word of God answer: “Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons, and thy son’s sons . . . ”—Deuteronomy 4; 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After announcing to his covenant people the rules which they must obey God says to them: “Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. . . . ” —Deuteronomy 11:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Note these specific commandments concerning the teaching of the children: . . . “And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.” —Deuteronomy 32; 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The parents who have agreed to do the will of God must teaeh their children to love God: “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children . . . ’’—Deuteronomy 6: 5-8. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Parents who love God will keep always in mind concerning th^jr children that the life of the child is involved and that it is of the greatest importance that the child should be instructed from its youth onward as to what God requires of those who shall find life everlasting. [Pages 267-271]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In all of these scriptures there is nothing that would warrant the Sundayschool idea. All of these Bible citations are very specific that it is the parents’ responsibility to first learn God’s law and then teach His commandments to their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Senator</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> TFns </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wrong</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one has this proper Scriptural understanding he can appreciate how wrong the senator was who sponsored a resolution (S. Res. 86) in support of “World’s Sunday School Association”. On February 26, 1945, this so-called “Christian statesman” said: “T am a staunch! believer in the Sunday school. I was brought up by a Quaker father and mother. T wish it were possible for every boy and girl not only to have Sundayschool training but also to be a regular attendant, at church. The church and Sunday school have done more to establish good citizenship and righteous government in America than any other influence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The facts do not support the assertion. The Chicago </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font4"> (June 2, 1945) quoted the “Rev.” Alan W. Watts, chaplain of Northwestern University, as saying that less than 8 percent of the population of the United States has “a real interest” in religion. Said this Episcopal priest: “Only 40 percent of the people of America belong to any kind of religious organization, and of that 40 percent a mere 15 to 20 percent is in any sense active.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, Sunday schools have not established “good citizenship and righteous government in America”. After a hundred years of effort look at the brood Sunday schools have incubated in these “last days”: “covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents ... despisers of those that are good . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” (2 Timothy 3:1-6) Christians'? Nay, Senator, nay!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. Sunday schools are not supported by the Bible; Sunday schools were established by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to teach young children the catechism; Sunday schools ’were set up by Protestants in imitation of Catholicism; Sunday schools have made neither good citizens nor Christians; Sunday schools are indeed a failure! Therefore, you honest and sincere parents who see these Sunday-school houses of religion crumbling and falling, flee. Elee to the Theocratic Kingdom mountains mentioned by Christ Jesus in Matthew 24, and, in such haven of security, teach your loving children the precepts and commandments of Jehovah God, that they too may live in the New World long after Sunday schools have been forgotten.</span></p>

Added together 2,278,000 bombs were rained down, of which approximately 10 percent were the pyrophoric type.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Going Up to God’s Mountain</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">N THESE days we are witnessing the fulfillment of the words of Micah 4:2: “Many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacoh; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” The mountain of the Lord to which men of good-will out of all nations are now go-ing up is the established kingdom of Jehovah God by His Messianic Kang, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this earth the highest political “mountain” of this thing called “Christendom” is the United Nations organization. It tries to poke its summit up above the “mountain of the Lord” and to dominate all the earth. Hence it is opposed to the universal domination of Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ. It assumes to stand in the “holy place” where God’s kingdom rightfully stands. Therefore, according to Jesus’ prophecy concerning this end of the world, it is the “abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet”. (Daniel 11:31; 12:11) That 'desolating abomination’ will never measure up to the perfections and abilities of God’s kingdom by Christ, and hence will fail. At the coming battle of Armageddon this “mountain” will be abased to the grave, but Jehovah’s Theocratic Government or “mountain” will continue to be “exalted above the hills” for evermore.-—Micah 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And peoples shall flow unto it.” (Micah 4:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> These follow after Jehovah’s faithful remnant of anointed witnesses who take the lead in the present-day march to God’s kingdom. Due to the great publicity work of these witnesses since A.D. 1919 millions have heard the good news of the establishment of God’s “mountain” or kingdom, and many thousands have joyfully accepted the message, turned their backs on religion, and turned their steps toward the glorious mountain of The Theocracy. Like a great river, made up of streams from all the nations and being continually enlarged as thousands more join the movement into the Kingdom, these “peoples” of good-will toward God and His kingdom flow to it and openly and actively take their stand on His side. This the Devil, by his demonized rulers of “Christendom”, has viciously tried to prevent and to turn the flow of such peoples back, into the broad road leading to the “Dead sea” of destruction at Armageddon. This effort continues to fail. The combined demon forces and rule cannot halt the ingathering and flow of the peoples, the Lord’s “other sheep”, unto The Theocracy until all such are gathered into the “one fold” under Kingdom protection, as foretold at John 10:16. Standing immovably on that side and there holding fast their integrity toward God, those “other sheep” will survive Armageddon and form the “great multitude” that He will thereafter use to fill the earth with a righteous offspring in joyous obedience to the divine mandate once given to Adam.—Genesis 1:28; 9:1,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regardless of their nationality by birth the persons of good-will are. given God’s gracious invitation to come’up to the “mountain of the Lord”. (Micah 4:2) Those who will form the &quot;great multitude” of Armageddon survivors now come out of all nations, kindreds, people and tongues. (Revelation 7:9,10) They will form the nations who under The Theocratic Government will glorify God on earth; and concerning them it is written: “Rejoice, ye nations, with his people. And again, Praise the Lord, all</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ye nations; and let all the peoples praise him.” (Romans 15:10,11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver., </span><span class="font4">margin) “Who shall not fear thee, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font4">Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.”—Revelation 15:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These “other sheep” of the Lord are not called to go to heaven. They do not go to heaven and never will go up there. Their everlasting inheritance will be on the cleansed and perfected earth. They hear the remnant boldly proclaiming that God’s kingdom was set up at His enthroning of His King in 1914 and that the Kingdom is here, to destroy the wicked and to bless the obedient and faithful. Hence they go up to that “mountain of Jehovah”, to wit, to “mount Zion”, 'and take their stand publicly and outspokenly on the side, of the great God and His everlasting Government of . peace and righteousness. Their eyes have been opened to see the anti-Jehovah “abomination of desolation” presumptuously standing in the “holy place”, and they unhesitatingly obey Jesus’ command to forsake “Christendom” dnd her organized religion and to flee to the “mountains”, namely, to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, who constitute The Theocracy. They make a full and irrevocable dedication of themselves to God by Christ Jesus, and devote themselves un-dividedly to the Kingdom, and to its praise and service. They become publishers for the Lord God and strive to increase the numbers of publishers of the • Kingdom by informing others of goodwill and inviting them to take a like course, to join the company of those going up to the “mountain of Jehovah”, The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number “ten” applies to all the nations from which these of good-will come forth; and another prophet describes their action, in this phrase: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come people, and the inhabitants -of many cities: and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts: I will go also. Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men [all of good-will] shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew [Christ Jesus, the great Judean, who leads in Jehovah’s praises], saying, We will go with you [remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses] : for we have heard that God is with you.”—Zechariah 8:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They seek Jehovah’s “mountain” or Theocratic Government in order to worship Him and serve Him at His temple. They forsake confused religion, which is devilism or demonism, and join God’s remnant in exposing religion as of the Devil and as against Jehovah’s kingdom. Hence they say to those of a hearing ear: “Let us go up to the house of the God of Jacob.” The name “Jacob” applies in a modern sense to The Christ, Jesus the Head and the church which is His body. The “God of Jacob” is Jehovah. The “other sheep” now acknowledge: “Happy is he that ha.th the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God.” (Psalm 146:5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> “Jehovah of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.” (Psalm 46:11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Those going up to His mountain disdain the criticism and persecution of the present time and courageously associate themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and shoulder a goodly portion of the witness work and its responsibilities. In this course they must maintain their integrity, by constancy and by faithfulness to their obligations to God and never permitting anything to entice and turn them away from God’s “mountain” and its house, of worship to Him. Their reward will be eternal-life in the New World of righteousness.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Witnessing at a Big Hospital in Texas</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font4">Y PAL found the truth fifteen years ago; I found it twenty-five years ago; now we are both old men. We have to work to live. We cannot keep an aceu-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1 rate account of our Kingdom work, as * do others, but we witness as we work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our job is to help keep this 5,500-bed hospital clean, and to show the inmates to the different wards and clinics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a matter of great regret that there is so much waste here. Nothing served at breakfast.is saved for dinner; nothing served for dinner is saved for supper. I see enormous quantities of the finest foods on earth thrown away daily. These wastes include meats, breads, cakes, and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have hundreds of paralytics. They are in tender, capable hands of good doctors and nurses. I see nurses who never stop for eight hours at a time, mothering them, loving them and weeping for them when they come off duty. I wish I knew how to witness to these tender-hearted nurses I They are too tired to study much after their day’s work is ended. Nurses are grand, in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The insane wards are filled to the limit. Strong men guard them, and brave nurses are again on the scene to doctor them and mother them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Daily 1 see the men who go to the operation clinics; I see the marvels of modern surgery, but witness also those' who lose both eyes, or both arms, or two legs and one arm. It is wonderful how the nurses comfort these unfortunates, teach them how to use their artificial limbs, and never murmur or complain. There is endless work writing friends, parents, wives and sweethearts for those who have no hands. I wonder does the public know these who do this unselfish work for others; and how can we best reach them with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this mammoth structure are many places where we can and do leave free literature. We leave it at these places and watch the results as we go about our regular work. We observe that the books and booklets and papers that we leave behind us never stay long. We leave some at recreation places, some at the great library, and some at the great crossways. We cannot buy enough to stock these places as they ought to be stocked. We believe this is a good way to serve Jehovah. In December I placed 179 magazines, books and booklets, and my pal as many more. We are seeing some results of our work. Asking some how they enjoy the literature, we have received the answer, “Fine; I am sending it on to pa” (or to ma, as the case may be). Also, I have known of parents’ getting such literature and sending it to sons overseas. So Jehovah has a way of finding the meek, and none can stop His work.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>At the Last, Blessed with God’s Truth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font4">Y HUSBAND and I are both glad that we have become witnesses for Jehovah. This seems strange to our neighbors and friends, and some of them are shocked, because we have always been strong workers for the church. Both of us being lovers of righteousness, we thought that is what the church stands for, but, somehow, we were never satisfied with what went on there. Many times my husband was removed from this or that office in the church because he was outspoken for what is right. Some went so far as to call him a preacher-fighter. He was not that. He just loved the Lord and wanted to do right. Being a carpenter, he furnished most of the material and labor to build the first church house, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in later years we put up our home as security, to enable the making of necessary changes and repairs. But we never found in the church the comfort from above that we have found through the reading of your literature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the years that are gone, we constantly read the Bible and tried to teach others what we had ourselves learned, but now, in the light of present truth, we see wonderful things never before discerned. Thanks be to Jehovah God for our present privileges of spreading the Kingdom news that Jehovah reigneth, and that in his own due time all wickedness will be cut off. We have ceased going to any man-made church, and are now reveling in our Bible studies from one week to the next. Thanks to Jehovah God for the Watchtower and all its literature, which we know to be of the Lord.—Kingdom publisher in Texas.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>My First Book Study in Mississippi</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font4">HILE witnessing near my home here in Mississippi I called on a lady who seemed much interested. I offered her a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font4"> and she was anxious to accept the offer, but was unable to subscribe at the time. She asked me to subscribe for her and she would settle with me later; which was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When I called back I found the lady ready for her book study, which was arranged for Sunday afternoon. She attended church regularly every Sunday morning, but was always ready for the 'book study Sunday afternoon. After about eight months she moved away. She got in touch with the Memphis company and was baptized,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I have now received a letter from her stating that she has taken her stand fully for Jehovah and His kingdom, and that nothing will turn her back. She thanked me for starting the study with her. I replied that the credit belongs wholly to Jehovah and His King. It is surely evident that the Lord is blessing the book studies.—Kingdom publisher.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Viewing the Puritans Otherwise</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font4">AILING his letter from Gloversville, N. Y., but not disclosing his name or address, a gentleman writes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> regarding the Puritans in a manner worthy of publication, thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I suggest that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> do not rely entirely upon </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">McGuffey's Reader</span><span class="font2"> for its information concerning the Puritans and those notorious bigots, the Pilgrims, who denied to others what they demanded for themselves. People like Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson were obliged to flee from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No doubt many of them were thoroughly decent and honest, but to claim that they were in any way superior to others is going too far. The Puritans’ moral sense and love of liberty did not keep them from actively en-JULY 17, 1948</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">gaging in the slave trade, or from the brutal and merciless slaughter of Indians who stood between them and land they wanted. For sixty years all but church members were excluded from the suffrage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Their reason for leaving England was economic. Most of them were well-endowed with this world’s goods, including bond-servants. They wished to escape the exactions of the arrogant clergy and of the “nobility”, and hoped to become large land-owners in this country. All the heavy work, of course, was to be performed by tenants, bondsmen and slaves. There were to be, except for the aristocracy, the same social and class distinctions as in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Conditions of soil and climate, the lack of laborers, plus the fact that the Indians could</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">not be enslaved, spoiled their plans, and our Puritan gentlemen became mere farmers; later many took up various trades, also commerce, African slave trade included. I wonder how many of their sniffy-nosed descendants know that one pre-revolutionary governor remarked that “distillery was the hinge on which the commonwealth turned’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* Have you read how Cromwell and his Puritan hordes drove back the inhabitants of northern Ireland by fire and sword? Have you read of the massacre of Drogheda; that the survivors of the garrison defending that city were sold as slaves to the Barbados islands? Have you read of Cromwell’s custom of sending his scouts into Ireland to obtain more victims for this infamous traffic?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I obtained my information from a couple of encyclopedias and from Beard’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Rise of American Civilization.</span><span class="font2"> The authors of this last are considered the foremast living American historians; but, of course, no book of theirs can possibly equal in authority </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">McGuffey’s Reader.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>War or Peace. Which?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">S</span><span class="font4">OME! have said that one of the big mistakes that led to the second world war was made after the first war when battleships were scrapped and a disarmament program was adopted. Funny reasoning; is it not? How could there have been a World War II with its large-scale slaughter if all the weapons of war, naval and otherwise, had been destroyed? It was not the destruction of armament, but rather the race in building such, that made possible a second war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So when the admirals now say, Ernest King speaking,'“Until actual production of bigger, better and more numerous atomic bombs than is possible now, we cannot afford to discard the sort of power with which we won the recent war,” it is manifest that they have no intention of establishing a lasting peace, but desire to feverishly prepare for a more terrible and devastating war than has yet been conceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of which makes it plain that the nations of this Satanic world are being driven on by the urgency of Joel’s prophecy (3:9,10): “Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.” Armageddon comes on apace. Thereafter peace will reign, when machines of destruction are transformed into engines of production.—Micah 4:3.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Accidental</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">E</span><span class="font4">ACH year in the United States there are some 1,200 deaths from acute accidental poisoning. Many young children are attracted by the sweet coating of strychnine pills and mint-like fragrance of oil of wintergreen. Other children swallow lye, arsenic, nicotine, bichloride of mercury, digitalis, carbolic acid, and even kerosene. Some 350 children annually die of poisoning!</span></p>

The easy mistake of grabbing the wrong bottle off the medicine shelf is all too often realized when the victim lies on the floor gasping for enough breath to say, “I thought I had ...” either the laxative or cough syrup. However, it is encouraging to hear that the death rate from accidental poisoning has dropped to about half what it was twenty-five years ago.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Man-made Peace Has Always Failed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE League of Nations, after holding its last meeting on April 18, was discarded, together with all of its blunders, and sent to the ash heap of human failures. Now the United Nations setup occupies the full stage of international interest, boastfully assuming that it is capable of establishing a lasting peace. It is well, therefore, to remind credulous persons that this present organization’s efforts to establish peace will be as futile as its predecessor’s; in fact, from the time of its conception at Dumbarton Oaks such human efforts were doomed to failure. Digging back in the file of editorial comment, the following from the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday News</span><span class="font4"> of November 26, 1944, was found that gives a few reasons why such efforts will come to nought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This Dumbarton Oaks plan is only the latest in a long string of peace-eternal plans which began to be hatched back in the 12th Century. We borrow a partial list of these schemes from a book called “'The Problems of Lasting Peace” (Doubleday Doran, N.Y., 1942, $2), by Herbert Hoover and Hugh Gibson, both of whom have had considerable experience in making peace aid trying to keep it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One Gerohus of Regensburg, in 1190, suggested that the Pope (who wielded great temporal power in those days) could end war, and should do so, by simply forbidding it, and by excommunicating and deposing any monarch who might defy this edict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first plan for a League of Nations dawned on the world in the 14th Century, when Pierre Dubois of Normandy urged a federation of Christian sovereign states, with a Council of Nations to arbitrate all disputes among those states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The French King Henry of Navarre (15531610) had his Great Design for riveting peace forever on Europe, though only after Henry’s pet hate, Austria, should have been destroyed. Henry’s League of Nations was to be made up of 15 newly created states, with a Great Council to arbitrate all disputes, and an international army and navy to carry out the decrees of the Great Council [sounds very much like the 20th Century model]. Henry died before he could try out the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our own colonial hero, William Penn, published in 1693 his “Essay Towards the Present and Future Peace of Europe,” which called for a permanent international court to be established by the monarchs of Europe. Any monarch who breached the peace was to be heavily fined by the other monarchs acting in concert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The three great 18th Century philosophers, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant, all had perpetual-peace plans, and all of them, like the ones described in detail above, are echoed in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One peace plan which actually worked was the Pax Romana, the Roman Peace enforced by Rome for about the first three centuries of the Christian era. This one worked because Rome had the military power to make it work, and didn’t have any partner nations to argue about how to keep the peace and who should handle what part of the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As Messrs. Hoover and Gibson repeatedly point out, any one of these League of Nations plans would have worked in its time and could have been changed as world conditions changed, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font2"> human [creatures] had not been so human. Being human, they were the unending prey of their greeds, hatreds, suspicions, fears, ambitions. Therefore, the perpetual-peace schemes worked only on paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We can’t detect any grave changes in human nature of late years, either for better or for worse. Therefore, while we hope there won’t be any more wars after this one, we can’t see much ground for so hoping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor has any “ground for so hoping” come in sight in the last two years since Dumbarton Oaks. Nor have the invisible demon &quot;principalities, powers, rulers of darkness and wicked spirits in heavenly places’ (Ephesians 6:12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin),</span><span class="font4"> which exercise great influence, over the peoples</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of the earth, been destroyed. Nor has the pope “improved” any since the year 1190 in his ability to “forbid” war. In fact, he has not so much as reproved his own - Hierarchy for their open and active support of Fascism and Nazism in this last war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">। So, then, is there any reason to expect * that a man-made peace “decreed” by human frailty will be more enduring than a few years in which they will cry “Peace and safety”? The Bible- answers, No! “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh , upon them, as travail upon a woman -with child; and they shall not escape.” (1 Thessalonians 5:3) An eternal and unmarred peace will then be established by him whose title is “The Prince of Peace”, of the increase of whose government and peace there shall be no end.—Isaiah 9:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font4"> CORRESPONDENT of the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> Hanson W. Baldwin, once wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The mass bombing of European cities, miscalled “precision” bombing but actually area bombing in its effects, was just as terrible for the civilian men, women and children killed and wounded as for those blasted by the atomic bomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fire attacks upon Japanese cities burned people to death fully as irrevocably as did the atomic bomb. The atomic bomb had a quantitative advantage in death and annihilation; more people were killed, more burned, more homes destroyed [in ratio to the bomb load dropped]-, but actually the moral principle involved in its use was no different from that established a thousand times before in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The principle of killing (call it moral or otherwise) is the same regardless of the weapon used, some instruments being more effective than others in carrying out the intent to kill. This is the only difference, and not one of morals.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>In Greece, the Cradle of Democracy &lt;</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">N. AREA Greece is the size of New</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">York state or Alabama, and in population it is a little larger than Ohio; or at least it was, before Pacelli’s and Hitler's “New Order” got under way. The 7,108,-814.population (as of 1939) are ainon^ the most intelligent, active and energetic peoples of the earth. There are great extremes of heat and cold. This condition of things always tends to make people keep awake and of an independent and progressive spirit. The land is very mountainous. Of the 16,074,000 acres which it contains 13,350,000 are covered by mountains and lakes and rivers, leaving only about one-fifth arable. Education is compulsory. There are three universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As set forth in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> No. 664, February 28, 1945, those who are inter-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ested in operating or maintaining the king business have shown more than a paternal interest in shoving a king over on Greece and keeping him there, whether the Greek people wish it or not. The business has had its ups and downs. In 1925, the people voted the king out and operated a republic for ten years. Then George II (that’s the name of the one supposed to be ruling by divine right) got his king job back, and the dictator Metaxas tried to operate an authoritarian state. That’s another name for Fascism or Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">October 20, 1940, Mussolini, fired with the idea of catching up to his friend Hitler, sent an ultimatum to Greece at 2: 30 in the morning to surrender before daylight or he would force capitulation] So he came in by way of Albania and got</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">. CONSOLATION </span><span class="font4">one of the worst lickings in all his bloody career. The Greeks chased him out of Greece and had almost chased him out of Albania when Hitler had to come to his relief. Not satisfied with bringing the German legions against peace-loving Greece, the Bulgarians were given a free hand to also invade and rob and kill, which they did. The result was plenty of trouble for Greece. All this came about in six months’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Cost of Liberty</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British came to help the Greeks against the Germans, Bulgarians and Italians, and also to help George II back on his uneasy throne. But for a time it looked as if all was lost. The Bulgarians massacred 45,000; there were 13,000 killed in battle; and there were 450,000 starved to death. There were 40,000 executed by the Germans and Italians during their joint occupation of the unhappy land, and 8,000 more were killed in guerrilla warfare. In addition, 2,000 Greek seamen lost their lives in the effort to keep ships of the United Nations in operation. Twenty-three percent of all the buildings in Greece were destroyed,<sub>; </sub>including 400,000 houses out of a total of 1,700,000 houses; 18 percent of the population were rendered homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the reasons that Churchill lost his job is that no liberty-lovers in Greece or elsewhere liked the bungling, bullheaded way in which he tried to prevent the Greek people from having the kind of government that they manifestly desire. It isn’t human nature to be grateful to people who try to tell you how to run your own affairs. In July, 1945, there were as many British troops in Greece as there had been German troops there the year previous. When the German conquerors were chased out in the fall of 1944, the British came in to take their places, and that naturally made the Greeks nervous and apprehensive, more especially as George II had backed up the dictator Metaxas, and Greece did not want any more dictators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The methods that people who are in the king business are willing to use in order to shove over their divine-right racket on liberty-lovers was manifested when a certain Col. L.F.R. Shepherd, of the British army Intelligence Division, but posing as an American UNRRA worker, was killed in Athens. Traveling around under an American flag this man distributed to Greek leaders of royalist or Fascist organizations huge sums of money in gold sovereigns (as much as 2,000 to a single organization). This money was manifestly a bribe to get the royalists to wage war against the EAM Greek National Liberation Front and the ELAS, its military branch. And Shepherd was a protected spy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Marvelous Capacity for Blundering</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The politicians that have tried to shove the king back onto the Greeks have shown wonderful capacity for blundering. Among other things they deported 15,000 Greeks to North Africa, though many of these had been veterans of the campaign against Italy and later against the Germans. One-time politicians with the same big idea tried to make America like another King George, and it was a big blunder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Churchill and Mr. Eden, to save face, made Archbishop Damaskinos the nominal head of the Greek government until a plebiscite could be worked out. A General Plastiras was given actual control, but when it came out that he had written to the Greek minister at Vichy requesting Germany to mediate the Greek-Italian war, he lost his job at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a most foolish attempt to keep the people from expressing their opinions, or telling what they know. From eight similar items in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Labor Action,</span><span class="font4"> the following are selected:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Members of the government’s National Guard set fire to the offices of the workers organizations and destroyed the printing presses of the newspaper </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Popular Voice</span><span class="font2"> in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">town of Agrinion. Twenty-eight lawyers who had been defending EAMites [members of the Greek National Liberation Front] in court were arrested by the Athens police. They were released after several hours of gruelling, coercive cross-examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. There was similar procedure on the island of Mytilini. The offices of the three EAM newspapers .were attacked and their presses smashed, but nothing happened to the one royalist newspaper. Meantime the police (holdovers from the former royalist and later the German administrations) are as innocent of who did it as a bee that has lost its stinger. And there is still another awkward front to this thing, besides the already-mentioned items of bribery, deportations and hindrance of free dissemination of information. It is taken bodily from George Seldes, in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact</span><span class="font4"> for August 6, 1945:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scobie killed 12,000: Greek delegate to S. F. Conference, on way home, told </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact </span><span class="font2">editor that one of the big stories of war, British General Scobie’s shelling of Greek civilians, killing 12,000, was never told in America. June 29, London </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font2"> discussing Greek Fascism today, sponsored by Churchill government, stated General Scobie defeated ELAS, liberation forces, killing 11,000, and that 3,000 were killed by air bombardments in one Athens suburb, Kolinia.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Castilians-Catalans-Galicians-Basques</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Y</span><span class="font4">OU know them as Spanish; and so they are. But they are divided into the 17,000,000 ruling Castilians, the 5,000,000 Catalans, the 2,500,000 Galicians, and the 1,400,000 Basques, and the facts arc that each of these four groups wants to be independent of the others. In other words, they want what they do not possess, which is liberty. When the people that have some information have to flee from a country, it shows that that land is in a very benighted condition, and the Manchester </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font4"> stated in July, 1945, that at that time at least 50 percent of Spain’s university professors and schoolteachers were in exile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On his return from his job as ambassador to Spain, Norman Armour expressed the opinion that in December, 1945, the Spanish armv still consisted of 600,000 to 700,000 men and that Franco was spending one-third of his national budget to keep this crutch ready for instant use, should somebody tell him to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Spanish people are not inclined to get in an undue hurry about anything. Trains often run very late, sometimes - with no apparent concern about the printed schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some places the milkman drives his cow to the door of the prospective customer and she has the satisfaction of knowing that what she gets is really 100-percent milk, and with all the cream that belongs to it. In America she might get some milk, some chemicals and some cream; not much cream, but some. In America, the first thing done with milk is to take all the cream out of it and then put enough back in so that the man that sells it won’t have to go to jail.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>A Few Items About Furs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font4">OUNTING sheep as fur-bearing animals, it would seem that humans have 'worn furs ever since the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden. Seals, beavers, squirrels, raccoons, lynxes, muskrats, otters, foxes, skunks, ermines, chinchillas, monkeys, moles, opossums, leopards, weasels, fitches, martens and many other animals have given their all that humans might be comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rabbit skins (48,000,000 of them from Britain alone) go to the making of felt hats, or are processed to resemble ermine, chinchilla, beaver, ocelot, mink, sable, seal, squirrel, leopard, jaguar and even zebra. Buying furs of any of these kinds, unless you are an expert, may mean that you are buying rabbit furs. And the furs are all right, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In America, at the present time, a fruitful source of furs is the 6,000,000 muskrats taken in the great marshes of southern Louisiana during December and January. The marshes where this muskrat trapping is done are 15 tq 30 miles -wide and extend 400 miles from the banks of the Mississippi river to the eastern border of Texas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The human race is multiplying, it is extending its habitations, and it is inevitable that the fur farming which has made such progress in the twentieth century should provide substitutes for the furs of the wild animals whose number is lessening every year. Realizing this, a California man, with $500 in money and an idea, invested his resources in the highest grade Karakul ewes brought from Persia, and started raising black furs. In six years he had 2,500 Karakul sheep and his 12 acres of land at the beginning had become 2,500 acres. He sells three grades of fur, the broadtail, which comes from premature lambs; the Persian lamb, which comes from lambs 3 to 10 days old, and the Karacul lustrous open-type fur with the wavy pattern, which comes from lambs not older than two weeks. His ewes net him $6 each per month for the cheese made from their milk. It pays to have ideas. They bring returns.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>German Motor Roads</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE superb German motor roads, designed and built by railroad construction engineers, were a great help in the capture of the country. These roads were built on new rights of way. All cities and towns were by-passed. There are no grade crossings. There are two over and under passes to the mile. There are no sharp curves. There are no provisions for foot, cycle or horse-drawn traffic. The roadways are 78 feet wide. They have double three-lane ribbons for traffic, with 15-foot parkway between. They had intended to have 8,500 miles of these superb highways, and had actually finished about half of the mileage when the war came on and put a stop to road construction. '</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Mental Sickness Is Costly</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">HE number of those rejected by the United States army, navy, marine and coast guard during the war because of mental disorders reached a total of 2,300,000. Of this figure 1,825,000 were turned down in the pre-induction examinations, while 476,000 were later discharged due to mental weakness. This represented about 18 percent of the peak in the armed services, 12,440,000, and were classified as neuro-psychiatric, psychotic (or insane), and inaptitude (or educational and emotional deficiencies).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mental cases are not wartime problems only, but are also perplexing problems that will have to be dealt with during peacetime. Before the war mental diseases were on the steady increase and, as to be expected, the increased tempo of the war years accelerated such ailments. Dr. Thomas Par ran, surgeon general of the U. S. Public Health Service, estimated that about half the hospital beds throughout the country are filled with persons suffering from mental disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Considering only the small item of dollars and cents there is a staggering amount paid out each year for mental - and nervous sickness. State hospitals for mental diseases say it costs $335.84 per capita a year to take care of its hundreds <sub>t</sub> of thousands of patients. For individual * treatment in other hospitals the cost runs even higher. If it were possible to calculate the total annual cost paid out for the care and treatment of mental diseases it would amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Still greater than this cost is the untold suffering inflicted upon the victims and their families by such mental derangement.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>The Terror of Learning Something</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font4">NF of the most surprising things about the human family is the strenuous effort they will make to prevent learning anything, even if they die in the attempt. Thus, it seems like a very little thing to cook a chicken, leave it in the aluminum utensil in which it was cooked, eat it 24 hours later, and have to send for the doctor. Anybody can try it, anybody can get sick by doing that, and, of course, anybody, if he chooses, can thus learn that aluminum utensils are not suitable for cooking purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Newcastle, Pa., 19 masons were made ill after eating chicken sandwiches; but do you suppose that there is any danger that the health (?) authorities will discover that the chicken was cooked in aluminum and left to stand in it until the chicken meat was thoroughly poisoned? None at all. The people love to have things the way they want them. They want to cook in aluminum; it is ' so pretty and so easy to keep clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this easily understood subject of the poisonous nature of aluminum, P. X. Adams, of the Keystone Slate, writes in and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few years ago I had such beautiful geraniums on my wife’s grave that I decided to slip them for the next year’s planting. I had twelve slips potted and doing nicely. Not wanting to have them die through neglect, I took a new aluminum waiter my wife had purchased before her death, put the twelve pots in it and kept water in the waiter. In about two weeks I noticed that my plants were all dying. I was unable to save them.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Remarks About Dogs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">T ISN’T pleasant to be bitten by a dog, but the rabies scare may be magnified. Some doctors that have given study to the subject, and widely advertised their desire to see a case of rabies in humans, claim that no such cases have ever come to their notice. Dogs do sometimes bite humans. That in itself is bad enough. Uncle Sam claims that in the one year of 1944 there were 1,259 of their carriers bitten. If investigated, it will usually be established that the people that. own these dogs are like their dogs: hard to get along with. The government has the right to refuse to deliver mail where the postmen are subject to attack by vicious dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the other end of the line are the people that lose their heads in extreme affection for dogs. Tn Detroit a woman that had a son and heir presumptive left nothing whatever to ’him, but she did leave to her fox-terrier a seven-room house in Detroit, a home at Sebring* Fla., a bank roll of $20,000, and a caretaker or butler whose job it was supposed to be to see that the dog had coffee and doughnuts for breakfast and steaks or chops for supper for the rest of his life. It all shows that a woman may have</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">$20,000, two homes, a butler, and no brains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dogs have a way of making friends with humans, when they want to. There was that black-and-brown German police dog at Warren, Ohio. He' came to the office of Dr. D. E. James, a veterinarian of that city, and who, so far as he could recall, had never seen the dog before. Mr. dog came in, held out an injured paw and evidently wanted it cared for. The doctor was delighted; he fixed up the paw, and until that paw got well that dog came twice a day to have it dressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">true to Their Friends</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dogs are true to their friends, be they four-footed or two-footed. At Murphysboro, Ill., two dogs fell into a sewer manhole and could not get out. The third dog of the party was more lucky. He didn’t slip into the hole, but he stayed right by the edge of it for three days. Finally the police came and took his buddies out, and all three went oft together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And dogs can find their way around. There seems no way of explaining how they do it. At Elmira, N. Y„, a six-month-old puppy was lost for three days; it traveled five miles it had never before traveled; it found its way into the machine shop where its master works; and it went down the long line of whirring and buzzing machines straight to its master. We passed that story along from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Dumb Animals,</span><span class="font4"> that ever-interesting little magazine, and here’s another one from the same source:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A man went out and left his dog in his hotel room in the Hotel Commodore, on Lexington avenue. In some manner (probably when the maid came to tidy up the room) he slipped out, went downstairs, streaked it five blocks west on 42nd street, turned into Broadway, went up to the eighth floor and whined at the door of the office where his. own er was in business conference with another man. That was in New York city. A. reasonable inference, in this case, would be that the dog might have been at both places on a previous trip, and remembered them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be a fair statement that dogs are truer to their human friends than their human friends art; to them. The wife of an Illinois soldier wrote thus to her congressman: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My husband’s life was saved by an Army dog that found him while he was bleeding to death in a Philippine jungle. A Japanese sniper kept, shooting at the dog, but he would not leave. Finally, the Japanese hit him, but the dog remained until help came. Fortunately, this dog survived. Yet I have to face the fact that some; day, after the War is over, this noble animal may become just another victim for the vivisectionists— a quivering bundle of pain, to be carved and probed and mutilated until merciful death comes at last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vivisection Fairy Stories</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not believe the oft-repeated fairy stories that dogs and other animals used for vivisection are always anesthetized before the tortures are begun, or while they are under tv ay. Sonic of the times when no anesthetics are used are when dogs, including pregnant ones, are starved up to as much as 48 days; when they are literally burned alive with X-ray experiments; when they are deprived of sleep by walking them up and down or having them work a treadmill until they die; when they are whirled in the whirler until they die; when they are baked; when mustard oil is put in their eyes; when they arc frozen; when they are poison-gassed; when they are kept up to seven months in absolute darkness; when they are suffocated; when they are alcoholized ; when they are deprived of both food and water for days and are then given Ilochelle and Epsom salts; when ail possible liquids in their bodies are dried out; when they are subjected to excessively irritating vapors until death; when they are inoculated; and when two animals are sewn together. It’s a sickening list, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was big excitement at Northwestern University, where hundreds of men are taught to torture dogs by vivisection methods, when it was found that the dogs awaiting the above-named and other skillfully invented tortures were ' being deprived of water and of proper food even before their official, or shall . we say classical, tortures had begun. A $ dead dog was found among the live dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That’s cheerful, isn’t it? Also, saith the investigators, the animals were cruelly jammed into small cages and the kennels were alive with vermin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doesn’t it seem as if, when dogs are being held for torture in such a great institution as Northwestern University, they should be fed and watered and kept free from vermin? Wouldn’t it add something to the moral tone of the young physicians under training?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Fresh Supplies of Quinine</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font4">O PREVENT or to allay fevers, particularly those of a malarial nature, the world makes use of an immense amount of quinine. There are several trees from which cinchona bark, the source of quinine, is derived. Too much of it is not too good for anybody, and its continuous or excessive use may cause partial deafness, dimness of vision and headache.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During World War II so much quinine was taken out of the forests of Bolivia, and the best remaining sources in Peru were so inaccessible, that it became necessary to scour the forests of Colombia and Ecuador for suitable supplies. Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at this business of drugs), new stands were discovered in these latter countries, and new growths besides the regular cinchona tree were found to contain the coveted anti-malarial drug. Assay laboratories to decide the value for medicinal purposes were set up in the capitals of all four of these South American countries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">N</span><span class="font4">OAH was probably the first member of the human family to see the face of the moon, and since that day it has always been an object of interest, though it is not mentioned in the Scriptures until the days of Joseph, who, in a dream, saw the sun and moon bowing down to him. But certainly the Army laboratory at Belmar, N. J., was the first human institution to make direct contact with the moon, which it did by radar on January 10, 1946. The time which elapsed from sending the sound impulse to the moon, and getting the echo back at Belmar, was 2.4 seconds. In that time the rays had traveled 480,000 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the suggestions made after the contact had been effected was one by the air communications officer of the army air forces that eventually a form of radar code might penetrate millions of miles of space to reach the planets. The British have announced their purpose to reach the sun with similar rays, and have the thought that if they do so the result may be exceptionally intense bursts of radio waves from sunspots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Essentially, radar consists in the emission of a directional radio signal and its reflection back from any solid ■object, as a ship or airplane or, for that matter, a buzz bomb. Inasmuch as radio signals travel at a constant speed, the time taken for the signal to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font4"> out and back is a measure of the distance. One tube indicates the distance directly over a scale of miles; another tube indicates the elevation or azimuth of the object, and a third tube shows the directional bearing. In a moment, the exact location of the plane or other object is known and plotted, even though cloud, fog, darkness'and great distance intervene. Another tube developed later is the plan position indicator. This is virtual seeing by radio and shows the actual detailed map of the surrounding area on a tube similar to those used in television,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Radio Detection and Ranging”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Radar” is short for “radio detection and ranging”. During the war it was used to sink German ships hidden twenty miles away, without the gunners seeing any of them. Set up near a landing field wholly closed in by fog, radar may pick up an incoming plane from five to thirty miles out, Jine it up precisely with the runway and “talk it in” to a blind but wholly safe landing. Radar sees through the heaviest fog and the darkest night. It infallibly shows the absolute altitude of a plane, rather than its barometric altitude. In August, 1940, as the German bombers came against Britain, radar enabled the British to keep their planes on the ground until just the right moment to take off. One result was that of 500 planes that came over on one day only 315 were able to get back. The subsequent buzz bombs were so accurately plotted in the air that the exact points from which they had been sent were located, and those points of origin were attacked. On one day when 105 buzz bombs were sent across the channel only 3 arrived; all the others were destroyed en route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The use of five different kinds of radar equipment enabled airplanes in the skies to reply to ground interrogations, to locate height of the craft, to take advantage of beacon navigation, to identify ships beneath them, and to identify aircraft in the skies. After pointing out that radar may be used in guiding planes around storm areas, a writer on the subject in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> magazine says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And just as radar will be useful in preventing collisions between planes, or between planes arid, mountains, or in guiding planes home through fog, so will it help captains to avoid hitting icebergs or colliding with other ships in thick weather at sea. It is even suggested that radar be used on the front and rear ends of railroad trails, so that in foggy</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">weather the engineer would be in no danger of running into another train. Whether it could be perfected so that an engineer could see a washed-out bridge in the darkness is a question, but he might see a landslide or a cow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sixty-four Different Types</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One concern announced that through June, 1945, it had produced more than 52,390 radars of 64 different types. Some types weigh as much as 70,000 pounds each, while others weigh only 150 pounds. By radar targets were located 100 miles away, and the plane could tell exactly where in its flight it must drop its bomb load in order to secure a direct hit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the determining factors in World War II was the development of a shell that incorporated a radio sender and that automatically exploded by radio signal when it was at just the right distance from the target in the air or on the ground. This is called the proximity fuse and requires miniature tubes and parts that can stand being shot from a cannon while inside of the shell. Within seventy feet of the target it fires without contact or timing. This seems almost incredible, but is well established as a fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the peacetime uses of radar are that it is now possible to equip any ship so that it can safely navigate on the high seas or lakes or through harbors, regardless of limited visibility due to fog or other causes. The edge of any storm can ..be seen, its speed and direction and height and intensity. This makes an entirely new turn in weather forecasting. Clouds, rainstorms and thunderstorms are discernible, and, by getting reflection from the upper atmosphere, storms can be seen more than 500 miles away. The height and speed of clouds can be determined, the same as if they were aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the suggestion of the War Department a device similar to radio has been invented to help the blind. It is of about the size of a loaf of bread and weighs nine pounds. From this device a beam of light is slowly swung in an arc across the pedestrian’s path. This discloses obstacles two to twenty feet away. These obstacles are reported to the ear of the blind by an earphone, and he can thus guide his way along a crowded sidewalk or through a room filled with furniture, without running into anything in his path.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Dr. Hugh Mackintosh (Troon) writes: Your correspondents appear to have overlooked two rather important indicators concerning longevity. First, human remains have been disinterred by archaeologists, almost certainly pre-Flood, having characteristics that indicate longevity far greater than anything we can at present conceive. The most striking indication is the extraordinary way in which the teeth are worn right down into their sockets by long usage. Thus “the ancient cemetery at Ur (i.e., Abraham’s,Ur of the Chaldees), and the still more ancient one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(circa</span><span class="font2"> 2,000 years older) at the neighbouring site called Al-Ubaid, testify strongly not only against revolutionary theories but also to the accuracy of the Bible in ascribing long life-periods to primeval mankind.” And Sir Arthur Keith states: “Certainly, as physical anthropologists measure people, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">later</span><span class="font2"> people of Ur </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">were not the equal</span><span class="font2"> of the earlier people found at Al-Ubaid”; and again: “The ancient Sumerians were a large-headed, large-brained people, approaching or exceeding in these respects the longer-headed races of Europe. . . . The teeth of the early Sumerians of the Al-Ubaid cemetery were worn down to an extraordinary degree—much more than those of the people buried in the later cemetery of Ur itself.” Actually there is ample secular evidence to show that there once existed on this earth of ours a race of men of magnificent physique, splendidly muscled, with a brain capacity exceeding that of modern man, and having all the signs of extreme longevity. My second</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Longevity Before the Flood</span></h4>
<p><span class="font2">point is that in trying to estimate the claims of the Bible for great length of years your 'Correspondents are assuming that climatic conditions on the earth have always been as they are now, whereas there is much evidence that that is not so. In his book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Evolutionary Geology,</span><span class="font2"> McCreadie Price shows that the geological evidence supports the view that at one time the earth enjoyed a uniformly warm climate from pole to pole ideally suited for the growth and long life of plants and animals. The planks and animals that existed then and whose species have survived to the present day were giants of their kind. He also shows that a catastrophe of world-wide character occurred that could only be explained by the Fltxid of the Bible. There is only one thing that can ,be visualized as giving a uniformly warm and equable climate--namely, something that would envelop the whole earth so as to prevent the direct rays of the sun from penetrating its surface and. at the same time act as a heat-trap. The only thing that can be imagined as doing this is a complete envelope of water vapour high up in the atmosphere or at its upper limit. Under such conditions the climate would be uniformly warm, with no extremes of any.kind, and there would be no showers but a heavy dew to water the surface of the earth. Nor would the seasons exist as they do now, nor the clear distinction between day and night that a direct view of the sun, moon, and stars gives. If, by some chance cause, this belt or envelope of water vapour were to be precipitated on to the earth, the result would be a flood of the extent described in the Bible, with all those extremes of heat and cold, moisture and drought, that we now experience due to the action of the direct rays of the sun. So it would seem that conditions for animal and plant growth and survival were once much more ideal than they are now, and that we cannot judge the possibility of the extreme longevity claimed in the Bible on the assumption that climatic conditions were the same then as they are now.</span></p>
