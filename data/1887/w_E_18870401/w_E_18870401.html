One brother sold 59 copies of the paper bound DAWN, in part of one week, after the price was reduced.  The book sells itself best. Do little talking about it.  The Table of Contents and the book itself will do it better. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Expect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that every intelligent Christian should want the book and talk and act in harmony with that conviction, and your success will be accordingly.

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">VIEW FROM THE TOWER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   As this issue of the TOWER will be used largely as a sample paper, and will, we trust, reach at least one hundred thousand readers, we take this opportunity of extending to such the right hand of friendship. The common brotherhood of all mankind, through Adam, is cemented and bound tighter by our sympathy for each other as common sufferers under the curse of death, which passed upon us all.  And the weaknesses, and aches, and pains, the blindness and lameness, mental as well as physical, under which we all labor, should quicken our sympathy and love for those who have fallen lowest, or become most blinded.  This broad love, thank God, is ours, as we believe it is His for all his creatures.  We come to greet you, and to point you to the cure for all our maladies, and inspire hope and incite you to love toward God, whom you only need to know, to love; and whom you may come to know through his word and his plans therein revealed, which embrace and provide for you and all mankind abundantly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But our message is specially to the saints, those already consecrated to God, the truth-seekers, the &quot;children of the light,&quot; the &quot;little flock,&quot; the &quot;Royal Priesthood,&quot; the &quot;holy people,&quot; the &quot;peculiar people,&quot; &quot;The church of the first born&quot; ones, &quot;whose names are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">written in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heaven,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the living &quot;members of the one body,&quot; of which Christ Jesus is the only head, prospectively &quot;the Bride, the Lamb's wife&quot; and &quot;joint-heir&quot;--you we specially greet, extending to you both hands, sympathizing and rejoicing with you as &quot;new creatures,&quot; &quot;partakers of the divine nature,&quot; and also sympathizing with you in the weaknesses of the flesh; for we have our treasure (the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mind or spirit,) in earthen vessels.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We trust that our non-recognition of sectarian names, in which some glory, may be no barrier to your communion with us; for let us remind you that the Scriptures recognize sects, and divisions, and party fences, and lines among the true saints of God, only to condemn them as evidences of carnality, contrary to the spirit and teaching of our Lord and Master. The apostle suggests--While ye say I am of Luther, I of Calvin, I of Wesley, is it not a sign of carnality?  Is Christ, the head, divided?  If so, his body, the church, may be excused for dividing and separating themselves by creeds and party names from others.  But were Luther or Calvin crucified for you?  Or were you baptised in the name of Wesley?--See `1 Cor. 1:11-13` and `3:4-8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We address you, then, and desire to know you and to be known of you, not as members of earthly, human, carnal sects, but as we above addressed you, as members with us, and with all saints, of the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R919 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ONE BODY of Christ, whose names are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">written</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in heaven,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in our Lord's book of life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We come to you with a message which fills and overflows our own hearts with joy and praise.  The night of the permitted reign of evil is near a close and the prince of darkness, and error, and superstition will soon be bound by the prince of light --Immanuel; and all his works of darkness shall be scattered and undone by the bright shining of the &quot;Sun of righteousness&quot; with healing in his beams, to bless all the race of men for whom he died.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Go ye forth to meet him&quot;--separate yourself from the world and the spirit of it; come forth out of Babylon, as well as out of Egypt, and flee ye by the narrow way that ye may meet your King and Bridegroom.  The time for presentation to him is at hand, and as the Bride makes herself ready (`Rev. 19:7`), we have no time to waste.  Only the fellow-members of the one body can help </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">you,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and your assistance is needed to help </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that all may shortly enter into the joys of their Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Once we supposed that the grand consummation of the hopes of the Bride would be the death-knell of the world's hope, but now, thank God, as the distorted shadows of the night scatter before the rising Sun of the grand Millennial day, we can see that God's ways and plans are higher and wider than we once supposed.  And as it is written, He has put a new song in our mouths--even the loving-kindness of our God.  The dawning light shows us that our fear was taught us not of his Word, but by the precepts of men (`Isa. 29:13`). We find that the prince of darkness, taking advantage of the natural fears of the fallen race, distorted horribly the punishments prescribed for sin by God, making </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the sentence, to mean the very opposite --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in torment, so as to prevent our seeing God's love, wisdom, and justice, and to prevent our full reconciliation to him and our recognition of him as our FATHER.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But now, beloved, as we awake and arouse ourselves, and look unto the Redeemer and Life-giver, we find that the terrible things we supposed so real were only nightmares, from which it is so refreshing to escape.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have so much to tell you, and it is all so good, we scarcely know where to begin; but in this issue we present some of the simpler thoughts, just to give you a taste of our heavenly food which is meat indeed, giving spiritual health and strength which we never knew before, instead of the spiritual lassitude, and doubts, and wavering hopes, and fears and gropings in darkness, which once were ours.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The TOWER comes to you as unpretentiously as the ministers of the early church. We present no list of titled and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-renowned contributors, none whose fame would command your attention to the subjects we present.  But we come to you with the Bible as God's Word, and seek to enlist your attention to its statements, and your obedience to its requirements, and thus we hope to lead the hearts and minds of some of God's children away from the jarring confusion of precept and doctrine, prevalent among the various sects (divisions) of Christians, into the harmony, beauty, simplicity, and confidence, which come from the study of God's Word and its acceptance as a harmonious whole and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">self-interpreter.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It would be natural that you should wonder </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">how</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> these things could be true, yet not recognized </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">long ago</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by earnest Christians; and why so many of those in the churches manifest such a bitter opposition to things so full of harmony with God's Word, and so fully vindicating the justice, wisdom and love of our heavenly Father.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In answer to your supposed queries, we suggest that if a broad view of God's dealings and revelation be taken, it will be seen that he has a broad, comprehensive, and benevolent plan with reference to men, the order and details of which began to be recognized since Pentecost.  The light of revelation shines with special brightness on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ends</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the ages.  Upon the ending of the Jewish Age, which was the beginning of the Gospel Age, new and special light shone out relative to the blessed privileges about to be enjoyed in the Gospel Age.  Remember, too, that it came from the Scriptures, written long before, but which were never before appreciated or understood.  Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter and Paul, all quoted the prophecies and applied them to the events taking place in their day--the opening of the Gospel Age.  The prophecies had been there for centuries, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">revelation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or understanding of them was reserved for those in the ends of the ages. (See `1 Cor. 10:11`.)  So now, in the closing of the Gospel Age and dawning of the grand Millennial Age, we should expect the light to shine out brightly relative to God's plans for this incoming age.  And so it does.  Search and see.  Gem after gem of precious truth now glows with unparalleled lustre to the diligent searcher, not because of his superior ability to find it, but because God's due time has come for such to understand it.  Soon the blessed bow of promise shall be seen to span the whole heavens, and weeping earth shall dry her tears and shout for joy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is no more surprising that these truths relative to God's plan for the blessing of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all mankind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should have been but dimly seen heretofore, than that the call of the Gentiles to be heirs of the Abrahamic promise, (`Acts 11:18`; `Eph. 3:5,7`; `Gal. 3:29`,) should have been but dimly seen until the Gospel Age began to dawn.  We can understand scriptural statements only as they become due.  Thus--&quot;Light, (truth, was long ago) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sown</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the righteous.&quot; When due, the light springs up and gradually unfolds.  Thus our Father has made abundant provision for the household of faith; and the true servants shall bring forth things both </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">old,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the household may have meat in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">due</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> season.  The cause of the opposition on the part of many to the truth now due, is the failure to recognize this progressive and unfolding character of God's revelation of his plans.  Most Christians take for granted that good men of the past, who walked in the light then due, had all the truth worth knowing.  Knox, Calvin, Luther, Wesley and others were, we believe, good men and sincere, earnest Christians; but more truth is due in our day than in theirs.  According to God's plan, the light should shine more and more until the perfect day.  Many Christians of to-day make a great mistake, and sit in comparative darkness, when they might be walking in glorious light, because they search the theology of these men instead of the Word of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Turn away from musty creeds of times past and give more earnest heed to the ever living, ever fresh, ever unfolding, ever new Word of God.  Again, others take the Bible and search it only for the purpose of seeing how nearly they can make it to fit either their mental or written creed.  If your habit has been such, we hope you will at once resolve to lay aside all human teachings as authoritative, and hereafter judge all you hear or read by the statements of God's Word.  If you believe anything, make sure that you have Scriptural statements warranting it.  Prove all things, hold fast that which is good, and cast away all else.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The action of the nominal church today, relative to the light now shining, clearly resembles that of the Jewish church relative to light in the end of their age. They reject every new ray of light because it would conflict with some cherished theory or statement of their creed.  They are so full of their own plans and arrangements for converting the world, that they are unwilling to hear that God has a better, grander, and infinitely more comprehensive way of dealing with evil, and blessing and teaching the world.  Their ears are so stopped by the din and confusion of their own religious efforts that they cannot discern the plan of Jehovah.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Satan is doubtless interested in the promotion of the confusion of sects, and stimulates and encourages that zeal which is not according to knowledge, and thus hinders their hearing Jehovah's voice, saying, &quot;Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen: I will be exalted in the earth&quot; (`Ps. 46:10`).  Even so, let every heart respond, &quot;Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.&quot;</font><br />

I am also very thankful for the &quot;TOWER&quot; and pray our loving Father may long bless you to hold up the standard of truth.

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   BROTHER ADAMSON writes concerning the plan suggested in the March &quot;VIEW:&quot; &quot;Of course 50,000 DAWNS can be sold and should be, before 1888 A.D.  I was reckoning what would be my proportion and concluded on 1000.  So I order 20 copies paper bound and find I will have to order 20 every week.  Having sold about 100 I must sell at least 20 per week for the remaining 43 weeks of the year.  If 1000 subscribers to TOWER would sell each 30 copies during the year, the big part of the job would be over.  All could do this at the very low price now decided on, 25 cts. each.  I have a small boy here who sold several DAWNS at former prices, 50 cents.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While the discussion concerning the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the incorrigible is going on, I call your attention to Amalek and their figure in history and the Bible.  I believe both agree that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Amalek</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was utterly destroyed nationally and individually.  But while I saw plainly for some time that Amalekites appear to type those who enter the second death, the reason being given seems to add force.  They lifted up their hand against the throne of the Lord after they knew it as such, and never was the Lord's hand lifted to bear so heavily on any other people.--`Exodus 17:14-17` and margin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, Rochester is pretty well worked. I have six sets of boys loaning packets. Have articles every week in Sunday papers.

<font size="2" face="Verdana">MY DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:--I have just laid aside DAWN; I was reading &quot;Jehovah's Day;&quot; I am much impressed by what I have just read.  Although I have read this chapter previously, yet it came to me under many new and impressive features; hence I conclude that I am but a child in the primary department of the school of Christ; that I have but tasted of the spring-branch, and that the fountain is farther up the mountain side, of which if I desire to drink I must continue to climb.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, I am become unpopular to the Reformed sect; they became fearful; so I don't preach for them any more.  My own sect begin to mistrust me, but I am not sure what they will do, as I am about the only minister they know of who will preach for them caring nothing as to whether they pay him or not.  All that is wrong with me, is that I care as little whether my preaching pleases them, as I do whether they give me anything for it.  I am not popular and what is worse (to them) I am not trying to be.  I do what I can to spread the truth while earning my living by farming.  Yours in our Lord, J. P. M__________.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">TELESCOPIC AND MICROSCOPIC VISION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The human eye is beautifully adapted to human needs and human enjoyment, yet only when aided by the telescope and the microscope, do we discover those wonders of nature which hold us in mute astonishment.  The naked eye gathers in much of the glory that surrounds us, but unaided it cannot explore the seeming secrets of nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Assisted by the telescope men view the distant heavenly bodies, and study their order of arrangement, magnitudes, distances, motions, periods of revolution, eclipses, etc., and the causes of their various phenomena; and aided by the microscope we are enabled to study forms of earthly life and agencies of power invisible because of their minuteness.  Thus telescopic and microscopic vision together display the glory of God's work.  But suppose the eye were so formed as to have naturally both the telescopic and microscopic vision; would it be to human advantage? No, the vision of immensity, were it continually spread before us, would be wearisome to eye and brain, and leave no field for investigation and the joy of finding something new; and the constant vision of infinitesimal matter and life would mar almost every thing of beauty.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the natural eye is aided by the telescope and the microscope, to behold the wonders of the material universe, so we find the Word of God furnishing both the telescope and the microscope of divine truth.  By the aid of the divine telescope we have been enabled to view God's plan as a whole, and to see that it contemplates the highest perfection, glory, and permanent establishment, of all things in the heavens and in the earth.  By its aid we are enabled also to study the order of God's plan, to estimate the relative magnitudes of his various promises, to compute the distances in time, to observe the orderly motions in the various parts of God's plan, to mark the periods of the revolving ages and dispensations, and also to discover the causes by which such changes are brought about.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You who have learned to use it, adjust your telescope again, that you may view the wondrous plan of God, which is wide as the material universe which he created, and includes in its gracious provisions all of his creatures both heavenly and earthly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Viewing it as a whole, we have seen its order to be, first creation; secondly, discipline and development; thirdly perfection, blessedness and eternal glory.  We first find that Jehovah's direct creation began and ended in his Son, our Lord and Saviour, the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last.--`Rev. 22:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R919 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   He was the first and only begotten, and by him as Jehovah's agent, is all the divine purpose to be accomplished (`Rev. 1:8`). In the works of creation he was Jehovah's active agent--&quot;all things were made by him and without him was not anything made&quot; (`John 1:3`).  And now we find him the agent in the development and perfecting of all things.  It was Jehovah's power delegated to the Son, and it was Jehovah's glorious plan which he delighted to accomplish.  All glory and praise then to Jehovah's infinite wisdom and power and boundless love displayed in his marvelous plan, and honor and praise to Jesus, who delighted to accomplish his will, though it cost him humiliation unto death--even the death of the cross; and praise again to the Father who hath </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> highly exalted him and made him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partaker of the divine nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and given him all power in heaven and in earth--that henceforth all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">also.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R920 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let glory, honor and praise echo and re-echo to the utmost bound of the vast created universe, planned by Jehovah and accomplished by his power through his worthy, well beloved, and highly honored Son, the beginning and the ending, the first and the last, the Alpha and Omega of his creation.  The Father's delight is in the Son, and the Father's glory is manifested in him.  Yet the glory of the Son never has and never will eclipse the glory of the Father.  The Father has declared, &quot;I am Jehovah: that is my name; and mine honor to another I give not.&quot; (`Isa. 42:8`.) The Son never attempted to diminish the Father's glory, but always to add to it, saying, &quot;My Father is greater than I,&quot; and it is my delight to do his will. (`John 14:28`, `Psa. 40:8`, `John 4:34`.)  The glory of the wondrous plan, displayed in creation, redemption, restitution, and eternal perfection and glory of all things in heaven and in earth, belongs chiefly and primarily to Jehovah, and secondarily to his Son, who has been the honored chief instrument in its accomplishment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Leaving our observations of his creative work, we turn to view the great plan for the discipline and development of his intelligent creatures.  We have seen that all were created perfect, yet free to choose good or evil, and that for wise and benevolent purposes in God's economy, evil has been permitted to run its dreadful course in the human race and among some of the angels.  We see also that the great plan for human redemption and restoration, is so far reaching in its results as to finally settle the great controversy between good and evil for all time and for all creatures.  Evil is now </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">permitted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to exist and flourish for purposes of discipline and development, and when this is accomplished, it shall be forever banished, never again to mar the face of God's finished work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But again, leaving these observations, turn your telescope to the still more distant future.  Dimly outlined because of its greater distance, the glorious future of eternal blessedness bursts upon our enraptured vision, beginning at the close of the Millennium with the great jubilee of jubilees, the jubilee of the universe, when Christ shall have put all enemies under his feet (`1 Cor. 15:25`).  There all tears shall have been wiped away, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things will have passed away.  And God himself will be with them and be their God.--`Rev. 21:3,4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Having taken these telescopic observations of the outlines of God's great plan, we note the order of its development, and from the data furnished in the Scriptures, and our observations of passing events, we are enabled to compute the distance in time, even to the final consummation--to the great jubilee of jubilees.  We have already marked the completed revolution of several great dispensational periods, and now realize that we are in the ending of another and just approaching the dawn of the Day of Christ, whose blessed reign shall wipe out the last vestige of evil and usher in the universal jubilee.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As we study these great revolutions in their minor details, we discover the principles and causes of their movements.  We see that the first dispensation, under the ministration of angels, completed its revolution at the time of the flood, proving the inability of angelic power to rescue man (`Heb. 2:2,5`); we see the law dispensation closing at the first advent of Christ, proving the inability of man to save himself by obedience to the law; now we see also the gospel dispensation ending, completing the selection of God's anointed priest, who alone can accomplish the great work.  At the same time we see the reign of evil completing its course. In all these great and the many minor movements of the various agencies of God's plan which have been brought to our attention, we see the one central and unchangeable purpose of God--the final, permanent establishment of righteousness, peace and everlasting bliss on a basis which recognizes the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">freedom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the individual will, yet by the tender cord of love links that will indissolubly to the divine will as the only condition of everlasting life and favor.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Seeing the grandeur of the work to be accomplished through our Lord Jesus, and the high honor bestowed upon him by the Father, we are enabled to estimate, to some extent, the exceeding great and precious promises to the members of his church--the &quot;eternal weight of glory&quot; to be shared by his joint-heirs.  And indeed this is the chief object and value of these glorious telescopic visions of the divine purpose; and that we may be encouraged to pursue the narrow way to its end, we should take frequent observations. Astronomers, as they study the material universe, become completely absorbed in it, and seem to live in an atmosphere and to be filled with a joy above other men; but how much more inspiring are the views which we have been permitted to take, and the wonderful truths and calculations deduced from them?  Here is a science which towers above every other, and a philosophy which, divinely directed, probes the hitherto hidden things of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, none can enter the watch-tower of Zion, or use the divine telescope, who do not come with meek and teachable spirit, with consecrated hearts, and a student's purpose to know the truth.  To such the Lord will blessedly disclose the riches of his grace.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But what of the microscope?  Thus far we have only been glancing briefly at the telescopic visions of God's Word; but what, in comparison, we may term the microscopic views, also wondrously declare the glory of God.  They declare his glory </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">most</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> emphatically to the natural man, for they are such as the natural man can more readily grasp and accept. These relate to the natural man, and his restoration to human perfection.  The telescopic views are chiefly for those who are &quot;new creatures&quot; and heirs together with Christ.  We turn the telescope heavenward, the microscope earthward; and the latter discloses the promises of restitution.  Close examination shows the blessedness of that restored estate--perfect human nature--and the necessary discipline to lead the race to it; the judgments of God in the punishments of the wicked for their correction, and rewarding the righteous; and the doom pronounced against present evil systems, ecclesiastical, civil and social, which, defying the power of the Almighty, bind and oppress mankind.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These microscopic views disclose to the vision of faith a physical earth that shall be man's Paradise restored--&quot;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad ...and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.  It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing.  The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon....And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water.&quot;  They point us to the fact that all obstacles shall be removed from the way to holiness-- &quot;No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon; it shall not be found there, but the redeemed shall walk there.&quot;  They show that all eyes and ears shall be opened to receive the truth, to be instructed in the right ways of the Lord--&quot;Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.  Then shall the lame leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing.&quot;  They tell of the joyful progress of mankind toward perfection under that wise and beneficent reign of Christ--&quot;And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.&quot;--`Isa. 35`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus these microscopic views reveal the blessed transformation which not only awaits mankind, but which also awaits the earth, which was &quot;made to be inhabited.&quot;</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;And still new beauties do we see,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     And still increasing light.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let every child of God search out these treasures of divine truth, long buried by divine wisdom, for our present comfort and joy, and proclaim to the world the blessed assurance that its paradise is to be restored, and that the great Restorer is soon to begin the glorious work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truth on every subject has always met with opposition.  Science and philosophy have had to contend for every inch of footing gained.  The use of the telescope and microscope were once condemned as improper prying into God's secrets.  And none the less is the searching of the Scriptures, thus making use of the Divinely-given telescope and microscope, opposed to-day on the very same ground--an improper prying into the mysteries of God. Blinded indeed is that child of God who cannot discern such sophistry, and the dark source from whence such suggestions come.  Does our Father give us a revelation of his will and purposes, and forbid our study of it?  Let us search and see, and be filled with the spirit and inspiration of these blessed truths; so shall we be enabled to run joyfully and with patience the race set before us.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation--to every one that believeth.&quot;--`Rom. 1:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The gospel, the good news or good tidings, is so good and so grand, that those who really see and understand it, have no occasion for feeling shame when they tell to others all they can of its height and depth, and length and breadth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It needs no apology on God's part, neither on the part of any of his ambassadors. In this respect it differs from all human theories which claim to be the gospel; for all schemes of human origin are necessarily imperfect, like their formulators. Of God's work alone can it be said, &quot;His work is perfect.&quot;  His thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways; for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are his ways higher than our ways, and his thoughts higher than our thoughts.--`Isa. 55:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Much is taught by those claiming to be true shepherds of God's flock which God has never authorized--much that misrepresents his character and plan.  To ascertain, therefore, what is God's truth we must have some way to decide what is human theory, and what is really the plan of God, which he declares is much higher than human expectation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some feel bound to take some very generally received view and therefore inquire, What do the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">majority</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of mankind believe?  But they soon find that the vast majority are heathens who have purely their own human ideas, and are entirely unguided by a divine revelation.  The next inquiry is, What do those believe who accept of the Bible as a divine revelation of God's plan?  When the answer comes, that those who accept the Word</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R922 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of God, are divided into hundreds of sects and factions, some larger and some smaller, some older and some newer, and that these contradict each other and oppose each other on almost every point of doctrine, while all have earnest advocates, and include among their adherents some pious, God-fearing people, the question becomes a most perplexing one--Which of these sects of Christendom is right?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Interviewing the various sects we are warmly received, and by each assured that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have the matter right--they have the &quot;good tidings of great joy&quot; and know well the great plan of the Infinite God.  And then they begin to tell us, some with one modification and some with another, that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good news</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which God has declared shall be for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all people,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is really good news for only a few, and dreadful in the extreme for the vast majority. They tell us that the vast majority are to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tortured</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unpityingly throughout ages of ages--eternity; and that a &quot;little flock&quot; a mere &quot;remnant&quot; or &quot;handful,&quot; is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saved from</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that awful torture (whether by an election with which they have nothing to do, or whether otherwise chosen, these sects do not agree).  And the eternal and monotonous service of this handful of favored ones shall be to watch their groaning, agonizing, tortured fellow beings, among them close relatives and dear friends, and the meanwhile sing praises to God for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a manifestation of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (?) and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (?).  To do so, their tender feelings of sympathy and compassion would have to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to feelings of fiendish brutality--otherwise they could not enjoy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an eternity.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We confess that if offered our choice between the two classes, whether we would be with such a God to all eternity and hypocritically sing his praises, while witnessing such fiendish torturing of fellow creatures, perpetuated by his will and power, to gratify such horrible malignity, or whether we would choose to honestly denounce his injustice, and to share the torture, we know not which would be preferable. Surely we would a thousand times prefer to be blotted from existence, rather than share in such a carnival of horror, anguish and woe.  Ah! there is no &quot;good tidings&quot; about that message. Not only is the joy for all people lacking, but it contains joy for none.  Satan himself would weary of such horrors and diabolic pleasures, before eternity had fairly begun.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Heart-sick, we turn from their revolting description, inquiring if </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be the &quot;good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people,&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">what</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bad tidings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be, in their estimation?  With confusion and a blush of shame, our friends begin to apologize for God and his plan, and finally they confess, that they do not understand it, and that their Confessions of Faith contradict their own sentiments of justice and right, that they received their ideas largely through the traditions of their forefathers, from which they only find relief in the thought, that the Judge of all the earth will do right.--`Gen. 18:25`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Ah! well we know that their hearts are better, purer, more just and more Godlike, than their creeds.  Thank God that it is so.  But as reasonable beings why accept and teach that which their own hearts as well as the Scriptures brand as a most wicked slander and blasphemy on the character of the God they worship, and whom in spite of their false theology they love?  All should see that such confusion of thought and such misrepresentation of the character and plan of God comes of the blinding influence of Satan through sects and creeds.  And why blindly support the various clashing creeds which your conscience in spite of long years of training, declares unjust, ungodlike and unholy, and a libel against the all-wise and benevolent Jehovah?  It is very evident that such a message is not the gospel, not the &quot;good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.&quot;  It is very bad tidings --the most awful tidings which ever reached the ears of men.  But thank God, this is not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> message, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> gospel.  It originated with the great Adversary of God and men, who took advantage of man's fallen condition, selfish ambitions, etc., mixed these horrible and distorting errors with a little truth, called it gospel and placed it in the hand of Papacy, who in turn caused all nations to drink of her </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mixed wine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;wrath&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rev. 18:3`). Her message has intoxicated the world, taken away reason and blinded the eyes of men to the truth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If this doctrine of eternal torment were true, it would be better far that man had never been created; for the torture of billions of beings eternally could never be compensated for by the joys (?) of others witnessing their torture, even if the numbers were reversed--if the few were in torture and the majority witnesses in glory. In fact, for those of noble mind and impulses to witness the tortures of others, would more than mar every joy; it would be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">torture</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to them, from which they would gladly escape in annihilation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If such be the natural feelings of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fallen,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men, what would be the sentiments of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man, as originally created--in the likeness of God?  To worship such a God, as we have described to us by the various Christian sects, to sympathize with such a plan, and to be in full harmony with it, would require the obliteration of every impulse of love and pity, the extinction of every noble trait and feeling.  The logic of such a gospel would be to prove the great Creator an arch-fiend, cruel and malignant in the extreme.  And all who now are seeking nearness to God and to his spirit would need to be changed to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fiends</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> also, to enjoy witnessing such an awful, eternal carnival of torture.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But thank God!  His ways and plans are higher, not lower than ours, and even our best minds and most just and noble hearts, need the direction and inspiration of his Word to enable us to grasp even measurably, the heights and depths and lengths and breadths of that wisdom, love and power which his glorious plan reveals. We must enter into closest sympathy, before we can see what God has wrought and praise him as we ought.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The great cloud of error which overspread the plan of God in the second and third centuries, and which deepened into a death pall under Papacy's supremacy, has been but partly cleared away since the thunder-storm of the Reformation, and nothing will scatter it fully, until the Sun of Righteousness shall be fully risen. But now in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dawn</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of that grand Day the &quot;friends&quot; of God are privileged to see and know concerning his plans, that which the masses of God's professed children, blinded by the various obscuring influences and agencies of Satan-- priestcraft, tradition, etc., cannot yet see.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The gospel which the apostles preached was not such </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bad tidings,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and they were not ashamed of it and had no need to blush or apologize for any part of it. Nor did they keep back a part: Paul declares, &quot;I have not shunned to declare unto you all the council of God.&quot; (`Acts 20:27`.) In every part of it he could greatly rejoice, and of none of it was he ashamed.  In all of this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> council of God, Paul said not one word about the everlasting torture, mental or physical, of a single member of the human family. Why?  Because that is no part of God's plan.  Not one creature that God has made will be tortured everlastingly.  The thought is absurd in the extreme and contradictory not only to every element of the divine likeness in us, but contradictory to every testimony of God's word. The theory is supported only by creeds, formulated in the darkness of past centuries by mistaken men, who had not fully escaped from the influence of Rome's mixed wine of wrath, many of whom undoubtedly were conscientious and all of them probably much better than their creeds-- much more just and benevolent than they represented God to be.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Even in the Bible this blasphemous doctrine has sought to entrench itself, putting a gloss and coloring upon certain passages, favorable to this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wrath-intoxicated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> view, as for instance the misuse of the words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell, damnation,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc., which, with the meaning generally attached, grossly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">misrepresent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the true sense of the Greek and Hebrew terms.  (See TOWER for May, 1886.)  They have succeeded also through hymns and commentaries and catechisms in twisting and coloring some of the parables and &quot;dark sayings&quot; of our Lord and certain parts of the symbolism of the book of Revelation (which book as a whole they do not profess to understand), so that under this false light these seem to favor their bad-tidings. But when the light of the knowledge of the goodness and glory of God, shining in the face of Jesus Christ, shines into our hearts and illuminates our understanding, it makes every parable and every symbol eloquent in the praise of divine justice, wisdom, love and power; and to form part of the &quot;Good-tidings of great joy, which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [sometime] be to all people.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thank God, all who thus see light in his light, from his standpoint, are &quot;not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.&quot;  The question then arises, Whence this light, by which we may see the glory of God, in the harmony and symmetry of his plan. If none of the various sects claiming to be the church of Christ possess it, where shall we look for it?  We answer, It beams from</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE WORD OF GOD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   While the various denominations each claim to accept the Bible as the rule of faith, the fact is, that they do not do so: hence the jarring discord of their teachings on almost every doctrine.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While education and habit of thought have much to do with our way of looking at matters, yet to suppose that honest minded men, whose sole desire is to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">learn</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the will and plan of God could each go to the Bible, desiring to there be taught of God, and then arrive at all the dissimilar religious views we see about us, would</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R923 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">certainly imply one of two things: either that God's Word is not a revelation, but a deceiving enigma--a labyrinth of confusion, or else that man in his fallen condition is so wretchedly twisted, that it is impossible for him to reason with his Creator or to understand the Scriptures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the Lord and the Apostles as well as common sense contradict both of these views.  Paul says &quot;The holy Scriptures are able to make thee </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wise</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;--&quot;That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished.&quot; (`2 Tim. 3:15-17`.)  And our Lord said, &quot;If any man will do his [my Father's] will, he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the doctrine&quot; (`John 7:17`).  Consequently we must look elsewhere for the fault, the cause of this discord of jarring sects and creeds.  And if it is not the Bible that is to blame, it must be that professed Bible students </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do not study it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> properly.  Yes, it is here that the fault lies.  Earnest, zealous, Christian men and women come to the Bible with prejudiced minds, full of creeds and theories of various sects, to which they are strongly attached by</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R923 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">chains of veneration, and habit, and family ties, and social ties, and fears, and pride, and spiritual laziness.  They come to the Bible not to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">taught</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, but to prove to themselves and others, that their theories or the theories of their sect ARE RIGHT.  And by ignoring passages or their contexts, which do not suit their views, and by bending and straining others, each seeker generally gets what he seeks, and confirms himself in his prejudices. At the same time, thank God, he that seeketh </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and submits his own will, and the theories of all others, to the light of God's Word, desiring to find the truth and to discover the error, is not left in darkness, doubt and confusion, but &quot;shall know of the [true] doctrine.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor should we ignore the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">assistance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of any of God's children in seeking an understanding of the Scriptures, but we should give attention to them only so far and so long, as they teach and explain the Bible, in harmony with the Bible. Whenever we find a brother, a teacher, either of high or low degree, in learning or talents, ABLE TO EXPOUND and to harmonize the Bible with itself, our attention should be earnestly given; for such a one is a teacher sent of God, and we are safe so long as we prove all things by the Word of God, and accept of theories and interpretations not because of the teacher, but because of the Scriptures, which his teachings show forth and harmonize.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But religious teachers of to-day would be almost ignored, if this rule were followed, for they know little of the Bible except some passages committed to memory in youth, and some looked out for special occasions.  And three-fourths of all the discourses, delivered in Christian pulpits, if examined by the average hearer in the light of the text chosen and its connections with the preceding and succeeding verses, would be found at wide </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">variance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and often directly contradictory of the Word of God.  But satisfied with their sect, the many &quot;at ease in Zion&quot; think not of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">searching</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Scriptures, nor of proving or disproving the doctrines proclaimed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As for the teachers, with many it is a business or rather a &quot;profession&quot; merely. They were taught in seminaries not how to search the Scriptures, but the reverse-- not to study the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bible,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor to expect to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">learn</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> anything from it; for if they should learn anything </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by their search, it would of necessity be something their sect would not endorse, and hence they would come in conflict with their party and its theology and be cut off.  They </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are taught</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the theology of the sect controlling the seminary, and are expected to know and teach neither </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so long as they are in its ministry.  In fact, generally they are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bound</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by a solemn vow to believe and teach according to the creed of the sect strictly.  Why then should they urge their students to &quot;Search the Scriptures?&quot; Rather, like the Church of Rome their influence is exerted to restrain investigation within the sectarian limits.  With the implied threat of disfellowship, they urge their ministers and students </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not to search</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> continually for truth, but to accept the voice of their sect as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">infallible.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They do not openly proclaim their sectarian infallibility and the bondage of their ministers for very shame, remembering that this was the very ground on which their founders originally </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">protested</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> against the church of Rome, claiming the right of individual judgment in the interpretation of the Scriptures-- hence the name Protestants.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Were it not for this sectarian influence over the members and teachers of the sects, how quickly might all the saints who hunger and thirst after truth come into unity and harmony of spirit and doctrine--all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">teachable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and all &quot;taught of God.&quot;  The Word of God would be more reverenced and would be &quot;quick and powerful,&quot; while an &quot;ear-tickling,&quot; world-serving, sect-bound clergy would be justly despised.  This state of things is even now at the doors.  The reason it is not more noticeable is, that the saints, the truth-seekers, are comparatively few, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">great mass</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the nominal church (all sects) being children of the world, unconsecrated, deceived by their teachers into the false assumption that they are Christians, and that by joining the sect and adding to its numbers and wealth they are joining the real Church of Christ, whose &quot;names are written in heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Convinced then, that we must individually seek the good tidings in God's Word, let us next inquire, What is the Gospel, of which we and the apostles and our Lord need not be ashamed?--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHAT IS THE REAL GOSPEL?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The real gospel is like a tree, it has a trunk or central part and out of this central glad tidings as branches, proceed various favors, each of which is a special additional feature of the &quot;glad-tidings.&quot; The trunk, the primary &quot;good tidings,&quot; is the news of our ransom: That Christ died for our sins, and thus redeemed us from sin and its penalty, death, by paying a corresponding price (`1 Tim. 2:6`) for Adam and all his race.  And in consequence of this redemption he shall in due time </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">deliver all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the dominion of sin and death into the liberty and favors of children of God, forfeited for all by Adam. The assurance which this gives is, that all that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was lost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through Adam </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restored</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through Christ, who declares that he came into the world to seek and to save </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which was lost.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Adam held the blessings and favors of God (life, etc.) conditionally: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">If obedient,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he might enjoy life and home and divine favor forever.  His failure terminated his trial, and God sentenced him to death as unworthy to ever enjoy the blessings originally offered to him.  Our Lord Jesus redeemed all the race from that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condemnation,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by enduring the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> penalty for all as the representative of Adam, and thus he provides a renewal of the original favor of life, and renews the trial, making it this time an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">individual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> test of worthiness or unworthiness to enjoy the divine favors everlastingly, the condition again being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obedience.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's plan is, to make the sinner a party to his own recovery, by arranging that an interest in Christ's meritorious sacrifice, our ransom price, can be had upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condition</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> only, namely: The sinner must desire and strive for reconciliation with God and must recognize Jesus' </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the only ground for that reconciliation. In other words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith in the ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is made as indispensable to the sinner's salvation from condemnation, as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">giving of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Being thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified by faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in Christ, he is granted a new trial for everlasting life, the condition of which is obedience to the extent of ability, as step by step they are directed and disciplined up to full perfection of being.  Hence the importance of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">telling</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all men of the redemption accomplished, and the importance also of their accepting the message by faith.  Everyone </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in him shall not be ashamed.  Whosoever shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">call</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for mercy and reconciliation, upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved, recovered, to that which was lost.  But none can call upon the Lord without knowing of him; hence the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">necessity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not only that Christ should give &quot;himself a ransom for all,&quot; but also that it should be &quot;TESTIFIED [to all] in due time.&quot;  Compare `Rom. 10:13-15` with `1 Tim. 2:6`.*</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So then this message, that a ransom has been given for all, which guarantees a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of great privileges and favors once forfeited, is the very center and body of the &quot;good tidings,&quot; and it is proclaimed in order that sinners may </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and thus obtain its favor of reconciliation and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new trial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for life.  But so fallen and prejudiced has mankind become, that he is an easy prey to his great enemy, Satan, who blinds the eyes of the vast majority, so that they cannot and do not see the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">simplicity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and beauty of the divine remedy for sin and its sting--death.  He blinds many with superstition and degradation, many more with priest-craft and false theologies, which misrepresent and distort the plan of God; and those in a fair way to receive the light, he blinds and chokes with thorns of care and thistles of wealth, so that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">few</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thus far have really </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heard</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with unprejudiced ears this gospel of great joy, which shall yet be unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all people.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So then, if there be not a future time more favorable to their hearing than the present, the &quot;good tidings&quot; would not be &quot;to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> people.&quot;  But the plan of God provides for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the ransom covered all and the declaration is, that it &quot;shall be to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> people;&quot; and this implies not only a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">testifying,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but also a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hearing.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This implies</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   *The context to the above, `Rom. 10:18`, will be treated in our next issue and will be shown to be in fullest accord with all the deductions of this article.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R924 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">also an awakening from death of those who have not heard, and also the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">binding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or restraining of Satan's power at such a time, so that all may hear of God's favor, call for the favor he provides, be reconciled to God through the death of His Son, and have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> second or individual trial for life everlasting.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Meantime God knew of the blinding influences of the world, the (fallen) flesh and the devil, and could have counteracted them as easily during the Gospel age as in the Millennial age, but another feature of his plan made proper the permission of Satan and evil until the end of this age. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">This</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> part of the plan constitutes an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">additional</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> feature of the gospel or &quot;good tidings,&quot; which applies not directly to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">people</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the other, but to a &quot;few,&quot; a &quot;little flock.&quot;  This feature or branch of the gospel is concerning a &quot;high calling,&quot; a &quot;heavenly calling.&quot;  It is not independent of the other &quot;good tidings&quot; however; quite the reverse, it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grows out of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good tidings of the ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a branch grows out of a tree trunk, and yet rests in it as a foundation.  In this figure of a tree the roots illustrate the divine wisdom, love, justice, and power, which though entirely out of sight, are the real sources of every favor and blessing, which has been or shall yet be developed in the full completion of the plan of redemption. The main central branch, representing the call during the gospel age of the little flock to the divine nature, is an ingrafted branch, whose fruitage will be very choice, (the few of the divine nature), while the many natural branches, proceeding from the trunk of this tree, will represent the manifold favors and blessings of God; and the fruit from these brought to perfection will be humanity in general.  As in our figure every branch, natural or ingrafted, depends upon the nourishment supplied by the root, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> TRUNK, so all favors are from and directly supplied to us by divine wisdom, love and power, the root which holds and supplies all favor, and yet all comes </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> RANSOM, which our Lord Jesus gave for all, which is the central trunk.  A branch or twig, attempting to grow up out of the roots directly and not out of the trunk, we call a &quot;sucker.&quot;  It can bring no fruit to maturity and is cut off.  So every one attempting to deal directly with the divine supply, ignoring the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is cut off as a thief and a robber.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During this age the natural (favors) branches have been kept pruned off, so that they could not bear fruit until the special or ingrafted branch &quot;of the divine nature&quot; had brought forth its fruit--the &quot;little flock,&quot; &quot;the body of Christ.&quot; Their portion is that of favor added to favor, good tidings added to good tidings. Redeemed and reconciled and offered a new trial for life, like all the rest of their race, these who have heard and accepted during this age, have been invited to become joint-heirs with Christ in his glory and honor and kingdom to come, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which Satan will be bound, and the &quot;good tidings&quot; of ransom and restitution made known to all, for faith and acceptance. With Christ, their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Redeemer,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as their chief or head, these are now being prepared by obedience and suffering and trials of faith and patience for opening the blind eyes, unstopping the deaf ears, and lifting up the fallen, until all shall know the Lord from the least to the greatest-- until the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the whole earth, until all branches of divine favor, proceeding out of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all, shall have brought forth as fruitage a perfect race enjoying all that was lost and redeemed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Even now amid opposition and weaknesses and discouragements, at the cost of much self-sacrifice the members of the body of Christ delight to do what they can of this work of blessing and lifting up the fallen and depraved, and thus they prove themselves worthy of the grander, glorious, and successful service as God's co-workers and ambassadors of the future.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So then we find, that the message which God has sent us, preaching </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peace and life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by the blood of the cross</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to every one that believeth, is indeed the central good tidings. And since it shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">testified to all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in due time, we see, how it will be good tidings &quot;to all people.&quot;  This is the &quot;everlasting [good news] gospel,&quot; mentioned in the symbol of `Rev. 14:6`.  It already is being sounded forth and must during the Millennial age now dawning, reach every nation and kindred and tongue and people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul says, that God declared this gospel beforehand to Abraham, in the promise: &quot;In thee and thy seed [Christ, and his little flock of overcomers--members of his body, `Gal. 3:16,29`] shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all the families</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of the earth be blessed.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Gen. 28:14`. This good tidings, given to Abraham, is exactly the same we here present, the blessing is the reconciliation and a second trial under most favorable circumstances for all the families of the earth, secured by God's favor </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the ransom for all, given by Christ.  The message to Abraham, of the blessing of the world, incidentally hints at the &quot;high calling,&quot; showing the &quot;seed&quot; to be highly exalted as God's agency for blessing all.  And Paul points out this seed, saying--&quot;Which seed is Christ&quot; (`Gal. 3:16`); and &quot;If ye be Christ's, then are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Abraham's seed and heirs [of this high honor] according to the promise.&quot;--`Gal. 3:29`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the angels announced the birth of our Saviour (though they saw not the philosophy of the divine plan of redemption and reconciliation, as God has since revealed it to his saints by his spirit) they added the Hallelujah chorus, &quot;Glory to God in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">highest,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and on earth peace, good will toward men.&quot;  They sang prophetically of the grand outcome of the message they bore, the &quot;good tidings of great joy, which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto all people.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is indeed the glad tidings, and who that realizes it as such, does not feel that God's plans are higher than man's plans, and his ways higher than man's ways.  With the Apostle Paul we may well with reverence exclaim, Oh, the depths of the riches both of the knowledge and wisdom of God!</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;JUST AND TRUE ARE THY WAYS.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ... for [i.e. because] therein is the righteousness [justice] of God revealed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [our] faith, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [our further] faith.&quot;--`Rom. 1:16,17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   While the gospel which Paul preached was &quot;good tidings&quot; to men, it was tidings which did not dishonor God, but on the contrary showed forth and magnified his justice and his law.  Suppose Paul had preached, saying--&quot;Ho sinners!  God sends you a message of joy, that he has concluded, that the original sentence upon mankind--death--was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">too severe,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and he now sends you a word of promise, that he will release you and restore you to life by a resurrection, shortly.  So many of you as believe, rejoice and enter his service.&quot; Such a message would have been good tidings to men, but therein would be revealed not the justice [righteousness] of God, but injustice, unrighteousness. Such a message would be an admission of error and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">injustice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on God's part in the original sentence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Or secondly, suppose Paul's message had been, &quot;Give ear, O sinners, God now sends you a message of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pardon.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  You are guilty, and under condemnation of death justly; not one feature of the death sentence was unjust or unmerited, but God has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed his plans,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and proposes to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">set</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aside his own just verdict</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and allow his love to rule him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as he at first allowed his justice to rule him.  He therefore offers </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pardon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to all who will accept of it, and full restoration to all he once took from us.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Such a message might seem to men to be good tidings, but therein would be revealed unrighteousness, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lack of justice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on God's part; for while claiming, that his original sentence was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he would thus be undoing his own </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> work, which would be rank </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">injustice.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  According to Justice it would be as wrong, as unjust [unrighteous], to let a guilty one go free from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just penalty</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his guilt, as to punish one not guilty.  Justice would be equally violated in either case.  So if this had been God's plan, Paul would have been ashamed of it; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> therein would have been revealed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">injustice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on God's part.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides, if God was sincere and honest and just in his original sentence upon the sinner--death--were he afterward to as sincerely and honestly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reverse his own decree</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and pardon the guilty, it would show </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on his part: that he like fallen imperfect</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R924 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">human beings is ruled by impulse, whiles just and whiles </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjustly loving.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If such were our view of our Creator, what dependence could we place upon his promises more than on his threats?  If he should change and clear the guilty, whose life he once declared forfeited, might he not change </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and rescind and recall the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjust pardon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and inflict the just penalty? If he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his plans even once in six thousand years, we have no security for eternity.  Such a plan would leave us as uncertain of God's promises and threatenings, as many earthly children are uncertain of the promises and threatenings of their parents.  Such a message, when thus examined, would not really be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">very</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> good tidings, and Paul would be ashamed of it, for therein would be revealed the unrighteousness and changeableness of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Or thirdly, suppose Paul's message had run thus: &quot;Beloved, I have a glorious message for you from God; it is this: God wishes you now to know, that he is about to restore and bless you, and wishes you to come into harmony with him and his arrangements.  God in the past has only deceived us, but thus did evil that good might come; but now he will deceive us no more.  Adam's trial and fall, and through his fall from divine favor, the fall of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was a farce, and the sentence of death, dust to dust, pronounced in Eden, was a mere deception.  God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never meant</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R925 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">such a penalty, though he pronounced it. And for thousands of years God has simply been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pretending</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wrath and death against sinners, and has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> pain, and trouble, and death on the world, to carry out his great deception.  Really, God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never meant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> what he said, that death should be the wages of sin; and he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never will inflict such</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a penalty</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--it was all a deception.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God is telling us the truth, telling us of his love and favor; he is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no longer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> trifling with us; and presently he will remove present evils, which he put upon our race not as a penalty, for we never really and justly deserved it, but he put them upon us as a blessing, which shall be for our good.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What kind of &quot;good tidings&quot; to men would this be?  It might be considered good news in that it would hold out a hope of escape from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pretended</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but unmerited chastisement for sin, never imputed to them by God; but such a message would proclaim God a liar; and any message from so unscrupulous a being would be unworthy of the slightest acceptance or credence.  And such a message should not be heeded at all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So, then, none of these is the gospel of Christ which Paul preached, and of which he was not ashamed; for Paul's message revealed the righteousness, the justice of God, which these do not.  Besides, in none of the above is Christ a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">necessity,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though some of our day who preach one or other of the above gospels of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unrighteousness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, drag into their message the name of Christ and his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> But Paul's message was not good tidings, with which Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> merely were connected, but good tidings </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> making him and his sacrifice the basis or foundation of the good tidings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And fourthly, let us suppose Paul's message to drag in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ, as so many now preach it and believe it, thus: &quot;Oh! sinners, I come to you with the message of reconciliation! God is pining for your love and favor. He has been trying to draw you to himself for thousands of years, and finally sent his Son to tell you that he loves you and wants you to love him.  Do not believe those parts of the Scripture which teach that 'God is angry with the wicked;' ignore those also which speak of the wrath of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now revealed against sin and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinners,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in death and misery, as we see them all about us; endeavor to bury your senses and believe that God is not, and never was angry with the wicked; and believe also that death never </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and never will be the wages of sin.  Cast such Scriptures and facts from your minds, if you find no way of twisting them to fit this message.  Then, accept of this as God's message: God wants you to look at Jesus and his perfect, sinless life and to follow his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> perfectly.  Do this and you shall have life and every favor of God. But you had best, when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">talking</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of this matter, use the words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for sins, often, so as to draw attention away from the fact that this gospel contains no thought of a ransom from guilt, condemnation and death, and no thought of a sacrifice, except it be that each sinner would thus sacrifice his own sins.  This thought we could not admit unless by supposing that Christ Jesus was a sinner and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrificed his sins,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinners</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are to follow his example and sacrifice each his own sins.  Should this point be noticed by any who do their own thinking, pass it over by saying that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">philosophy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the plan of salvation cannot be understood; and thus smother the objections.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of all the foregoing this is the most deceptive, in that it furnishes greater opportunities for misapplying those scriptures which applied and were given to the Jew under Law, and not under favor in Christ, and those also which mention the privilege of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saints, already justified from sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by faith in Christ's blood, to join with Him in sacrifice, becoming so far as possible imitators of him, not in putting away their sins, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(He</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had none and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">theirs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are already reckoned as blotted out), but in sacrificing pleasures and interests </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not sinful,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the good of others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the weakest of all these four false messages for it embraces all the defects of the others and adds to them.  This message ignores the Scriptural penalty for sin, as well as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fact</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of death, offering no solution for the same.  It thus implies, either that no sentence was pronounced and that man has been unjustly punished thus far, or else that God will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjustly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ignore, and set aside, and cancel that sentence, having </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his plan.  And lastly, after all this, it has no &quot;good tidings&quot; in it; for it lays down conditions which no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinner</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> can comply with: namely, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">following</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ's example perfectly.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  No saint (justified from sin and restored to divine favor through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith in the sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for his sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which Christ gave, and supported and helped in every time of need), can hope to follow his Master's example </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfectly,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and how useless would it be for a sinner to attempt it (</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjustified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by faith in the ransom, unreconciled, still under condemnation, the merits of Christ not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imputed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to him, to cover as a robe of righteousness his filthy rags;) and how absurd to tell such to go to God and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">be reconciled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by following the example of Christ. No, there is no good tidings in this to any who can and do use their reasoning powers. They see how the whole Jewish nation for hundreds of years tried to commend themselves to God by good works, yet all failed; and by works and sacrifices none were reconciled or justified.  Faith --faith in Christ's finished work on our behalf--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> corresponding price, given </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ground</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of reconciliation, on which the sinner can come to God.  All his works and sacrifices are blemished, dead and unacceptable, until he is reconciled to God through the death of Christ, the just one who died for the unjust, to bring us to God.  Thus we who were as sinners afar off, under condemnation, are brought nigh to God--within reach of divine favors, blessings, and promises, by the blood of Christ.--`Eph. 2:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Gospel, the good tidings of great joy which Paul preached, not only did not reveal God as changeable, unreliable, and unrighteous, but on the contrary it did reveal a plan, by which the justice, as well as the love of God came to our rescue, for having so loved us as to provide our ransom, He is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to forgive us our sins once atoned for &quot;by the death of his Son.&quot; This gospel admits of our guilt.  It admits the death-penalty to be the just wages of sin.  It acknowledges the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">facts</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of dying and death all about us, as effects of that penalty pronounced upon our perfect representative, of whose condemnation to death we partake by inheritance.  It acknowledges that this penalty, being a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one, can never </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be set aside.  Paul's gospel shows how the Son of God became a man, perfect and sinless like our representative, and then gave himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or corresponding price for Adam, and hence for all who were condemned with him, through his failure.  This was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">foundation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fact of Paul's gospel.  The second part was, that Christ having thus paid our ransom price, by meeting the full demands of justice, against Adam and all whom Adam represented in his failure --a man for a man--his resurrection in another and higher nature proved that God had accepted and rewarded his sacrifice of himself, by thus creating him again and highly exalting him even to the divine nature; and this not by taking back our ransom price--his sacrificed humanity --but allowing it to remain dead to all eternity, that we might go free.  He now lives, the divine Christ, to accomplish for all in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">due</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time the blessings which as a ransom for all he secured by his death as &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ Jesus.&quot;  God can and will now </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justly,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> JUSTIFY freely all who call upon him for it, through him who is the &quot;way and the life,&quot; who redeemed us with his own blood and now lives, exalted and powerful, in due time to release, restore, and bring back to harmony with God all the redeemed ones who will accept of his favor, when brought to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of it.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This basis of all that Paul preached, he declares in few words, saying: &quot;I delivered unto you first of all [as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">foundation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the gospel] that which I also received [first of all], How that Christ died FOR OUR SINS according to the Scriptures,&quot; and rose again the third day for our justification. --`1 Cor. 15:3,4`; `Rom. 4:25`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another feature of the Apostle's message built upon this, was, that as the ransom had been given for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as believing thereon was the only way by which any could receive the benefits of that ransom (a second chance or trial for life) THEREFORE it must sooner or later be testified to all.--`1 Tim. 2:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another feature of his message was concerning further favor, open to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> believers during the Gospel age, namely, &quot;access into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this grace</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (favor) wherein ye stand,&quot; rejoicing &quot;in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hope of the glory</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God&quot; (`Rom. 5:2`).  Access to justification, divine favor, harmony and peace, came first through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith in the ransom.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">next</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> came access to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glory</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, the privilege of becoming heirs of glory, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ, their Lord, on a specified condition: namely, If they would </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer with him.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Access to this high calling, this invitation to suffer with Christ now, and afterward to reign with him, and be made like him partaker of the divine nature, was offered not to sinners, but only to those justified from sin through faith in his blood.  Faith in his blood changed them from being children of wrath under condemnation, and made them children of God through faith, under his love and favor.  And it was not until we ceased to be condemned sinners and became </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified human sons</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, that we were invited to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our human rights and privileges, and reckon ourselves thus followers in Jesus' footsteps, and heirs </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him of future glories.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R926 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We praise God, then, not only that the time is coming, when the good tidings of great joy, of redemption and forgiveness of sins </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him that loved us and bought us with his own precious blood, shall be made known unto ALL PEOPLE, but we praise him also, that the plan he has chosen is wise and just, as well as loving. We thank him that we can see how he can be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while justifying the guilty ones whom he once justly condemned, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him whom he set forth to be the propitiation (satisfaction) for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  Thanks be to God! Paul was not ashamed of this gospel, and we are not ashamed of this gospel of which we also are made ministers and ambassadors; for therein </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is revealed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the righteousness of God, appealing to our faith as reasonable, and furnishing us a firm foundation for faith and trust in all his future dealings--those revealed to faith and those unseen as yet.  Truly it is written, that all who have the harp of God in tune and have gotten the victory over the doctrines of the beast and his image, etc., can sing heartily of this gospel, saying, &quot;Great and marvelous are thy works [plans], Lord God Almighty; JUST AND TRUE ARE THY WAYS.&quot;--`Rev. 15:2,3`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R926 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">EVERLASTING TORMENT.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Nowhere in Scripture is everlasting torment set forth as the wages of sin.  The nearest approach to such a declaration is in `Matt. 25:46`.  &quot;These shall go away into everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">punishment.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  What the punishment </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not shown in this connection, except in the symbol </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;fire&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`verse 41`). The fire is as much a symbol as the other features of the parable, sheep, goats, etc.  Fire is always a symbol of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> never a symbol of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">preservation.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The nature of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">punishment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for willful sin, which is to last forever, is elsewhere stated plainly and explicitly to be death--destruction. &quot;Who shall be punished with [or by] everlasting destruction [i.e. a destruction from which there shall be no recovery--no resurrection] from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power.&quot; (`2 Thes. 1:9`.)  &quot;The wages of sin is death&quot; everlasting,--not life in torment everlasting.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Consider well the fact, that our Lord Jesus took the place of sinners under the first condemnation for sin (Adam's).  Had the penalty for sin been &quot;everlasting torment,&quot; he, in paying our penalty, would have been compelled to suffer whatever the sinners were condemned to suffer as sin's penalty.  It is written, Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all.  He bore our sins in his own body on the tree. He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">died</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the just one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for the unjust.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He gave himself a ransom--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a corresponding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">died</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for our sins,&quot; but he did not suffer everlasting torment for our sins. Hence if there was no other evidence on the subject, this alone would prove that &quot;The wages of sin is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot; and not everlasting torment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have heretofore examined in these columns various figurative passages of the Bible, which from the prejudiced standpoint of early education, seem at first glance to favor everlasting torment.  We refer new readers to the following articles in the October, 1886, issue: viz., &quot;Undying Worms and Quenchless Fires,&quot; &quot;Turned into Hell,&quot; and &quot;The Lake of Fire and Brimstone.&quot;  See also March, 1886, issue, &quot;As the Serpent Beguiled Eve.&quot;</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LOST AND SAVED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot;--`Luke 19:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Nearly two thousand years ago Jesus, then present, affirmed this to be his mission; but as yet no visible evidence of its accomplishment appears.  The world moves on in its downward course now, as then.  Sin and misery triumph still, and century after century plunges successive generations into death.  Have we failed to understand the import of the Master's words? or has he been unable to accomplish his purpose? or may it be that his purpose is so far reaching as to be of future fulfillment?  With these queries in view, let us consider the subject before us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> each have a significance known to all: A thing lost is a thing once possessed, and a thing saved is a thing once possessed and then either kept from being lost, or else recovered after having been lost.  Jesus said the thing he came to save was the thing that men had lost; and the implication is, that since </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had come to save the thing lost, men were unable to save it for themselves, which experience and many scriptures clearly prove.  Now if we can determine just what man lost, we will know just what Jesus came to save. Man could not lose what he never had.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Adam, who stood as the representative of our race, had a perfect human organism and a right to everlasting continuance of life, on condition of obedience to God. He was privileged to enjoy all the delights of his Eden home, and the communion and blessings of God; in short, all the privileges that everlasting life under perfect human conditions is capable of enjoying and looking forward to were his.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All this Adam lost through sin, both for himself and for his posterity.  Home, happiness, communion with God, health, and life itself, were lost.  Consequently, mankind lies in utter wreck and ruin, dead and dying.  In having lost his right to life, he fell under the dominion of death, whose successive steps of misery, depravity, sickness and pain, end in total extinction of being, from which he can never recover himself.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus came then to save and restore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that which was lost;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to restore man to his original (human) perfection, and to communion with God, to give him back his paradise restored, and all the pleasing prospects of future blessings that accumulating ages can bestow, and that the powers</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R926 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of perfect humanity will be capable of enjoying.  What! does some one say, Is so much implied in those words of our Lord?  Yes; this is one way in which our Lord foretold the restitution of all things.  All this is implied in the word saved. Think of it; could the words mean less than this?  Certainly not; and, from this and many other scriptures, we have learned to trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe. (`1 Tim. 4:10`.)  There is a special salvation for some, as well as a general salvation for all men, as Paul here intimates, but we are not considering the special salvation now.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the above text, Jesus was speaking of the general salvation of all men--the saving of that which was lost.  For God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.&quot; (`1 Tim. 2:4`.)  When men are actually saved, their restored existence will be as at first, dependent on obedience under trial for its continuance, and obedience will be easy and productive of constant happiness when evil and temptation are finally removed, and the great deceiver and tempter is bound and finally destroyed, and when the law of God is written in their hearts.--`Jer. 31:33`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, we might inquire, when does our text indicate that Jesus will thus save the lost?  However crude and indefinite the ideas of the Jews and the early disciples at first were concerning the promised salvation, they had learned both from the prophets and from Jesus' teaching, that it would be accomplished, when the kingdom of God should come.  And when Jesus stated that he had now come to save the lost, they at once concluded that the Kingdom of God should immediately appear.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Because they had drawn this inference, and to correct their false impression, Jesus spoke a certain parable, the import of which was, that he must first go away and receive for himself the kingdom, and return.  &quot;And he called ten servants of his and gave them ten pounds, and said unto them, Trade ye herewith till I come.&quot; (`Luke 19:13`. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">R.V.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Diaglott</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rotherham's translation.)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They, in the meantime, as faithful servants, were to use the talents entrusted to them according to his directions, and in the interest of his cause and of his coming kingdom, patiently waiting for their reward at his coming.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But Jesus implied that in some sense he came at that time, to save the lost--&quot;The Son of Man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> come,&quot; etc.  And in one sense it was true, for he then purchased them with his own precious blood, and though not yet liberated from the prison of death, they may be truly reckoned as saved ever since their ransom was paid; for their raising out of death was from that moment made sure.  Just as you might say of a pardoned criminal, that he is a saved man, although even he himself may not yet know of his pardon nor have yet experienced a release.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Though no one is actually saved now, yet the Scriptures speak of believers as now saved by hope; that is, by accepting of God's promises as unquestionably sure, they may </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> themselves as already fully saved; not as merely awakened from death, but as saved from the last vestige of death and sin--as made perfect.  &quot;We are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?&quot;  We do not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">see</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our salvation yet, except by faith.  &quot;But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wait for it.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 8:24,25`.) Our hope and faith would indeed be vain, unless salvation means much more than we now enjoy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle's statements that God &quot;is the Saviour of all men, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">especially</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of those that [now] believe,&quot; and that God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">have</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all men to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth,&quot; as well as many other scriptures, prove to us that all men are to be saved by Christ from degradation, misery and death now upon all through Adam's disobedience.  And yet they show us two classes of saved ones-- all mankind and the Church.  While all are saved, one class is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">specially</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> saved. That is, by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">special arrangement,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> some (all believers of the gospel age) are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in season to run for the prize offered during this age.  One class will not be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> saved than the other; both the Church and the world will be completely saved from Adam's sin and its penalty: and all the world will realize this in due time, in their restoration to perfect human life, while those </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> saved now, as though they had already received the perfect human life, are privileged to relinquish this new claim and title to it, presenting it as a sacrifice to God, holy and acceptable to him, when offered in the acceptable time (the gospel age).  And being thus sacrificed with Christ, they will be privileged to partake with him of a new nature. (`2 Pet. 1:4`.)  These will receive glory, honor and immortality --the divine nature; while the world in general will receive the glory, honor and blessedness of the perfect human nature, which is an image of the divine (`Gen. 1:27`). The former class, the church, is specially saved, severely disciplined and highly exalted, that through them the blessings of restitution may flow to all the world, when God's due time shall come.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We see, then, that while the full import of our Lord's words has not been understood by many, and while many believe, that he is unable to save the lost, as he promised to do, the fact is, that his plan was so far reaching that short-sighted dying men, could not measure or comprehend it.  As now seen, the truth uttered in those few words required nearly three thousand years for its full accomplishment. At his first advent Jesus gave himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to save all (`1 Tim. 2:6`); during the centuries since, he has been developing the class who have in this time followed him in sacrifice, and who are to share with him in the work of saving or restoring all things; and within the coming thousand years the work of saving men will be actually accomplished.  If, then, &quot;when we were enemies we were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reconciled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by his life.&quot;--`Rom. 5:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Because in God's order men could only be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by a payment of their penalty which would be the BASIS of their reconciliation and atonement with God, therefore, as a means to an end, we see that Jesus' mission at his first advent was to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">save</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the sense of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeeming,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while his second advent will complete the work by restoring to perfection </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all the redeemed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- all for whom Christ died, and by the grace of God he tasted death for every man.--`Heb. 2:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is one other thought of special importance in this text.  It is that the Son of Man came to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seek</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that which was lost.  Now we inquire, Is there any evidence of very earnest seeking of lost ones on the part of our Lord?  Some would think not.  All men were lost, and this text implies, while `John 12:47` clearly declares his purpose to save all; but he said, &quot;I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&quot; (`Matt. 15:24`.) He did not seek out any of the lost Gentiles, and charged his disciples not to do so for some years.  But Jesus did seek out a certain class--the meek-- who were waiting for the promised salvation; and it was his purpose to begin with Jerusalem, to save such as would believe, and to give to those of the seed of Abraham who believed, the first offer of the &quot;high calling.&quot;  And during the centuries since, he has only been seeking out and saving (reckoning saved) the same class (the meek) among the Gentiles, and making to such believing ones the same offer of the divine nature--a heavenly calling.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But a grander time of seeking is yet to come, for all the millions that are completely lost in death are yet to be sought out and saved.  And where shall they be found?  Notwithstanding the theories of men to the contrary, the Scriptures plainly teach that in death man's being is dissolved, that he is destroyed, blotted out of existence, that he is nowhere to be found. And with this fact in mind we might inquire with the Prophet Job, &quot;If a man die shall he live again?&quot;  With men such a thing seems quite impossible, but &quot;Why should it be thought incredible that God should raise the dead?&quot;  (`Acts 26:8`.) He that was able to create is also able to re-create those once completely destroyed. And through the prophet Isaiah the Lord speaks of the restitution as a new creation, saying &quot;Behold I </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">create</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> new heavens and a new earth&quot;--not the physical earth, for that abideth forever (`Eccl. 1:4`)--but the world of mankind is to be re-created. And the Lord says: &quot;Be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create.&quot; (`Isa. 65:17,18`.)  That the restored and re-created being will recognize himself and also his neighbors of former acquaintance, is unquestionably proven by many scriptures (`Ezek. 16:61,63`; `20:43`; `36:31`; `Zech. 12:10`; `Psa. 22:27`), and illustrated in the few cases where the dead have been measurably restored, as Lazarus and others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Job answers our question very clearly when he says (`chap. 7:21`), &quot;Now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seek</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> me in the morning, [the morning of the resurrection or restitution] BUT I SHALL NOT BE&quot;--I shall be destroyed, blotted out of existence.  But nevertheless, though thus destroyed, he says, &quot;Thou shalt call and I will answer thee.&quot; (`Job 14:15`.) Like Lazarus, at the call of Jesus, earth's dead millions shall again spring into existence. David declares the same truth when he says, &quot;Thou turnest man to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and [then] sayest, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">return,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ye children of men.&quot;  And with him we must say, &quot;Bless the Lord, O my soul; who redeemeth thy life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">from destruction!&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Psa. 90:3`; `103:1,4`.)  O that all the world could now realize the glorious import of those words of our Lord, &quot;The Son of Man is come </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to seek</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to save</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that which was lost.&quot;  It was a glorious truth to realize at his first advent, that the plan of God had so far developed that the promised Messiah had actually come to save men by the sacrifice of himself; but it is still more glorious now to realize that our Lord comes a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time, to apply the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">benefits</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of that sacrifice, to claim and restore his purchased possessions, to actually and completely save that which was lost.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While we have thus stated what we believe to be the Scriptural teaching concerning the salvation of men, we would yet more particularly answer the inquiry of some--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHAT MUST I DO TO BE SAVED?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Perhaps the reader already sees that he has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nothing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to DO.  All that was necessary to procure your salvation was done long ago, before you were born; and in consequence of the redemption provided, all mankind, whether they ever knew it, or believed it or not, are going to be awakened to life again, are going to be saved from the Adamic condemnation.  God will have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men to be saved; and though they may never have known him before, to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> brought to a knowledge of the truth--of the love of God exhibited in the gift of his Son as our ransom price.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, we seem to hear some one say, that is a strange answer.  I thought you would tell me to pray, or to get some Christian friends to pray for me, that I must try to realize that I am the chief of sinners, that I must kneel at a mourner's bench, or something of the kind, but you have not even told me to repent or believe. You simply say that I </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">am</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> saved, and that I have had, and can have nothing to do with it, but to accept of it with thanks and love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No, friend, we do not say that you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> saved, but that you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be saved; and that you have had, and can have nothing to do with the means which procured your salvation.  It is a free gift of God, in consequence of which all will be saved or recovered from Adamic condemnation now or in the coming age; but you are in no sense saved now unless you have come to believe in Christ your Redeemer.  If you do believe this Bible truth, then you may through that faith </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yourself as saved now--saved by hope; but you must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wait</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the actual salvation until God's due time. (`2 Thess. 3:5`.)  Of course faith in and reliance on Christ as your Redeemer implies a realization of your need of a Redeemer, and a repentance and turning from sin.  You may have been one of the very chief of sinners, or you may not have been so bad as some others; however you were bad enough to merit the just condemnation of God's law, for he who offends in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> point is guilty of all. (`James 2:10`.)  He is a violator of the law, and as a consequence is under condemnation.  If you have always lived just as morally and as carefully as you could, you have fallen short of perfection, because of the weakness of nature, you inherited through Adam's fall. (`Rom. 5:12`.) But though nothing that you have done or could do could save you from death, that which Christ has done procures your release from it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul said, &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.&quot;  This is the condition on which we receive the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned salvation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> now, and it will also be the condition on which the world will receive their actual full salvation in the age to come.  We must bear in mind that the awakening of men from death is only the beginning of their salvation. Not until they have, under the discipline of the next age reached perfection, are they fully saved.  Although we might truly say, men are saved when first awakened from death, yet they are not &quot;saved to the uttermost&quot; until brought to full perfection of being.  But none will be thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;saved to the uttermost&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who do not accept of their release from death as the direct result of the sacrifice of Christ. And realizing this, they must repent of past sins and turn to God.  Otherwise they die the second death, from which there is no ransom and no release.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, says our inquirer, this seems true and Scriptural, but what advantage is to be gained by being reckoned saved now? Would it not be as well to wait and give ourselves no concern about it, but let God's plan take its course?  O no, we answer, there is an advantage, a great advantage to be gained by prompt faith and obedience as soon as we can gain sufficient knowledge on which to base our faith and obedience.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The special privilege of those justified by faith (or reckoned saved) during the gospel age has been their right to present themselves as acceptable sacrifices to God --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joint-sacrifices</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Jesus Christ, and thereby to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joint-heirs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with him of all things.  That privilege, we believe, began with the day of Pentecost and ends with the Gospel age.*</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> special privilege was not offered to any before or since that time, another special privilege was granted to believers before this age, and we see no reason why a similar privilege may not be granted to believers after the gospel age is ended.  Those justified by faith in past ages will have no need of trial and discipline in the next age, for their judgment is past; and consequently in the instant of their awakening they will be raised to perfect human existence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A similar blessing, we believe, is in store for those of the world who now repent of sin, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as their Redeemer and rightful Lord, and wholly turn to God.  As heretofore frequently shown, we find that we are now living in the Day of the Lord, in the beginning of the Millennial Age--the Times of Restitution.  And since it is appointed for the very purpose of restoring life and all things, we think it possible for such to remain without ever passing into the tomb.  For it is just as easy when God's due time comes, to keep men from going into farther death, as it is to raise them out of it.  This is not possible in the case of those who are to change their nature and become &quot;new creatures&quot;; it applies only to those justified ones who never started for the high calling.  Therefore we should expect that such should in answer to prayer be healed from sickness, etc., but they cannot be brought to full perfection until the saints are first glorified; for &quot;They without us shall not be made perfect.&quot;--`Heb. 11:40`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Probably very few will come to realize their privilege now.  The tendency of the world is more and more towards skepticism, and few can claim this privilege; nevertheless, we believe it to be the privilege of any such who have faith to claim it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In answer then, to the question, What must I do to be saved? we would say, &quot;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.&quot;  Your salvation may begin now, and progress until you are restored to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of your being--saved to the uttermost.  For &quot;he (Christ) is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">able</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to save </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to the uttermost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all that come unto God by him.&quot;-- `Heb. 7:25`. [--ED. D. R. (See R605:4)]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   *It may be proper, to guard against misunderstanding, to say, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the extent of CONSECRATION is not all; such have yet to complete the sacrifice and it will not be complete till actually dead.</font><br />
