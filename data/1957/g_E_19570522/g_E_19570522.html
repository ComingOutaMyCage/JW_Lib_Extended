<p><span class="font20">A</span><span class="font13">MONG the many things a person may seek during his lifetime happiness is undoubtedly one of the most desirable. But although many seek it, few actually find it. In view of the constant struggle for existence in this world, the wicked acts of oppressive rulers and the devastating, effects of war, some may feel that it is unattainable. They cannot see how a person can be happy when the wicked prosper and when everything one has worked for is in constant jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Happiness can be found but not in the way many are seeking it. Those who think the golden road to riches is the sure way to happiness are due for disappointment. Material possessions and financial security and the pleasures riches bring are not the ingredients that make for happiness. This is pointed out by the Bible when it says: “However, those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reach</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ing out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">with many pains.”—1 Tim. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A No matter how much money a V person may possess he can be one of the most unhappy persons in the world. To love and to be loved are basic requirements for happiness. But a rich man can never be certain that anyone loves him for what he is and not for what he has.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In marital relations there cannot be happiness when true love is absent. The exercising of true love by marriage partners means they are unselfish, considerate and long-suffering with one another's imperfections. Unless they do what is mentioned at 1 Corinthians 13:4-6, marital happiness cannot exist. It states: “Love is long-suffering and obliging. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth,” The wife who exercises love in this manner will not become contentious, making her husband feel as if he would prefer to live on the roof rather than in the house with her. And the man who shows such, love toward his wife will contribute richly to her contentment.—Prov. 21:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A person’s spiritual needs must not be</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">overlooked. Fulfilling them is essential in the successful pursuit of happiness. This was pointed out by Christ, who said: ’Happy are those who are conscious of their spiritual need,”—Matt. 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even if a person succeeds in attaining a measure of happiness in this world, its existence is uncertain. It can be shattered by any number of things. A devastating war can quickly bring ruin to his happy home and his way of life. A disaster can strike, bringing death to his loved ones, or a disease may claim some as its victims. In order to find enduring happiness a person must look to God for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is the purpose of Jehovah God to establish a new world in which people can live in peace and security. This does not mean he will create a new planet but rather that he will bring about a new system of things upon this earth. In that system a person’s happiness will never be shattered. The things that destroy happiness today will not exist then. The basis for hoping in this new world is found in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The means by which it will be brought about is the kingdom for which Christ taught his followers to pray. In a model prayer he gave them he said: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt 6:9, 10) TTiat heavenly government is now established and is preparing to take over the rule of the earth. When it does, the complete end of the present wicked system of things will come. No longer will wicked meq oppress the people and commit acts of violence. No longer will nations rise up against one another in war. Uris is assured by God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a prophecy that uses bows, spears and wagons as emblematic of war weapons it is written: “Come you, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease tb the extremity of the earth. The bow he breaks apart and does cut the spear in pieces; the wagons he bums in the fire.” (Ps. 46:8, 9) And in another prophecy that promises the removal of the wicked we are told: “The sinners will be finished off from the earth, and as for the wicked, they will be no longer.”—Ps. 104: 35,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Perpetual peace is certain because God’s kingdom is an everlasting kingdom that will rule in righteousness. “And the work of the true righteousness must become peace, and the service of the true righteousness quietness and security to time indefinite. And my people must dwell in a peaceful abiding place and in residences of full confidence and in undisturbed resting places.”—Isa. 32:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to these causes for happiness we are assured that death itself will no longer plague mankind. “And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.” (Rev. 21:4) This is possible because the ransom paid by Christ, when he gave up his human life and presented its value to his Father in heaven, frees obedient mankind from the curse of death. “For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. As the last enemy, death is to be destroyed.”—1 Cor. 15:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Would not the realization of these promises be a source of happiness? Would they not make every moment of life an unspeakable joy? Are they not worth the greatest possible effort and sacrifice? We can trust them, for God is not one who lies. All who seek happiness through God's kingdom will find it, and what they find will be a true and lasting happiness.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font13">light facts that cause one to lose faith in God? Are there facts, little known to the majority of men but provedby science, that disagree with the Bible? The widely publicized viewpoints of atheistic scientists leave the impression that science casts grave doubts on the existence of God and the reliability of the Bible. But the facts show that not all scientists are atheists; in fact, atheists are not truly scientific, Said Professor Philip Henry: &quot;The person who thinks there can be any real conflict between [true] science and [true] religion must be either very young in science or very ignorant in religion,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Does a knowledge of the world around us cause us to doubt that God is? In studying the earth scientists find the factors that explain the regularity of the seasons and factors that contribute to the existence of life. They have learned that the earth is a free sphere that rotates on its axis, revolves around the sun with clockwork precision and is inclined on its axis about twenty-three degrees. The atmosphere is sufficient to protect us from the bombardment of twenty million meteors that hurtle toward earth at fantastic speeds every day. It also maintains the right temperature for life and carries inland the water vapor so necessary for the growth of vegetation. The special properties of water—absorbing vast quantities of oxygen as well as decreasing in density and releasing considerable heat as it freezes—work for the preservation of marine life in winter. The soil, too, contains minerals that plants are sa^le to assimilate and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font13">available for con-Wfc^qn by man and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">withput </span><span class="font13">tvhich he could</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">ton sat reading in his stu$&quot; mechanism on a large table his infidel friend stepped in. Scientist he was, he recognized at a glance w was before him. Stepping up to it, he slowly turned the crank, and with undisguised admiration watched the heavenly bodies all move in their relative speed in their orbits. Standing off a few feet he exclaimed, ‘My! What an exquisite thing this is! Who made it?’ Without looking up from his book, Newton answered, ‘Nobody!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Quickly turning to Newton, the infidel said, ‘Evidently you did not understand my question. I asked who made this?’ Looking up now, Newton solemnly assured him that nobody made it, but that the aggregation of matter so much admired had just happened to assume the form it was in. But</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">the astonished infidel replied with some heat, ‘You must think I am a fool! Of course somebody made it, and he is a genius, and I’d like to know who he is.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Laying his book aside, Newton arose and laid a hand on his friend’s shoulder. This thing is but a puny imitation of a much grander system whose laws you know, and I am not able to convince you that this mere toy is without a designer and maker; yet you profess to believe that the great original from which the design is taken has come into being without either designer or maker! Now tell me by what sort of reasoning do you reach such an incongruous conclusion?’ The infidel was at once convinced and became a firm believer that ‘Jehovah, He is God? ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chemistry's Evidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Chemists use what is known as a periodic chart of elements. All of the known chemical elements, gaseous, liquid and solid, with the multitudinous and varied substances that fit into these classifications, conform to the Periodic Law. All the atoms of the more than one hundred elements are said to consist of the same three types of electrical particles: protons, electrons, and neutrons. And the difference is simply in the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus and the number and arrangement of the electrons. When these are arranged in order, they vary one from another in a systematic way. This has made it possible to know the actual atomic construction of an element before it was discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Declares mathematician-chemist John Cothran: “Can any informed and reasoning intellect possibly believe that insensible and mindless matter just chanced to originate itself and all this system, then chanced to impose the system upon itself, whereafter this system just chances to remain imposed? Surely the answer is ‘No!’ When energy transforms into ‘new’ matter, the transformation proceeds ‘according to law’ and the resulting matter obeys the same laws that apply to the matter already existing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That the universe had a beginning is borne out by the existence of radioactive elements, which are in a state of constant disintegration by reason of their emission of electrical particles. Had material things always existed, there would be no radioactive elements left. Their presence stands as practically incontrovertible evidence that the world is limited in age, that at one time it did not exist and that a creation must have taken place. So those who listen to the evidence presented by science must believe in creation. There could not have been creation without a creator. That Creator is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Atheism’s Lack of Reason</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But what is to be said when proclamations are made claiming that scientific progress testifies against the existence of God? The New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times.,</span><span class="font14"> January 23, 1959, reported that Moscow radio had broadcast a speech declaring: “The fact that satellites and rockets have not detected the All-Highest, angels and so on, bears testimony against religious convictions and strengthens disbelief in God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If, indeed, their observation of the overwhelmingly immense and orderly array of the heavenly bodies and their knowledge of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">the natural laws that made possible the </span><span class="font14">development of their rockets and satellites has not caused them to detect the fact that it is no mere product of chance but the handiwork of an Almighty Creator, it is not because they have discovered any facts proving that he does not exist. Rather, it is because they have become so blinded by their own success and so indoctrinated with the anti-God Communist philosophy that they fail to acknowledge the conclusion-to which their research</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">scientifically demands that they come. Their atheism is contrary to the basic belief of science that everything has a cause and that the cause must be sufficient to produce the indicated effect. The Creator, the Great First Cause who produced the universe, is Jehovah God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“If you think strongly enough,” declared physicist Lord Kelvin, “you will be forced by science to believe in God.” Why? Because science involves a study of the handiwork of God, and it would not be there to study nor would man be there to study it if there were no God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is not from true science that a Christian turns away, but it is from the pseudoscientific theories and philosophies of men who, with nothing but their own unproved speculation as a guide, call into question the Word of the Most High God, and, Satan-like, seek to divert the praise and worship due the Creator to themselves. It is of these that the apostle Paul was inspired to say: “O Timothy, guard what is laid up in trust with you, turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called 'knowledge’. For making a show of such knowledge some have deviated from the faith.”—1 Tim. 6:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Science and the Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Science clearly confirms the fact that creation reflects the work of a divine Intelligence. But a written revelation from that supreme One is necessary if we are to know who he is and what his purpose is. It is only reasonable that God would give man a revelation to guide him. Since man is the highest of earthly creation, it indicates that his Creator is specially interested in him. Both man and animals are made in such a way that they need air, water and food for existence, and their Creator has provided these things for them. Animals, lacking human intelligence, have been endowed with instinct as a guide. Man, unlike the lower animal creation, has an inborn urge to worship, and his Creator has filled man’s need in this matter by providing a divine revelation to be intelligently followed. That revelation is the Bible!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Our desire to worship did not come from science and is not dependent on it; so with the Bible. It is not a product of men of science and our acceptance of it does not depend on their approval of it, but the fact is that science does confirm the reliability of the Scriptures. While many textbooks of science become obsolete within a few years due to the discovery of facts that change man’s viewpoint, yet during the thousands of years of its existence the Bible has not had to be rewritten or brought up to date even once. In view of that, it is a far more reasonable course for one to make his acceptance of the theories of science conditional on the Bible than to make his acceptance of the Bible subject to the judgment of science. Nonetheless, the Bible is so written that it permits corroboration of its record by other sources of information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As evidence of the progress that has been made by science in lining up with the Scriptures, note the following statement by Harry Rimmer in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Harmony of Science and Scripture:</span><span class="font13"> “The reader may recall that famous list of fifty-one scientific facts published by the French Academy of Science in 1861, all of which contradicted some statement of the Scripture. Those few score years have gone by, and not one word of the Bible has been changed. In those same few score years, the knowledge of science has so vastly increased that there is not a living man of science today who holds one of those fifty-one so-called facts that were at one time advanced in refutation of the inspiration of the Scripture.” It becomes quite evident,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">then, that when anyone feels he has uncovered facts that show the Bible to be in error, the error will be found to lie not in the Bible but in man’s observations or in his interpretation of the meaning of the things he sees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Testimony of Archaeology</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Archaeology also raises its voice in corroboration of the Biblical record. In the November 19,1958, issue of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century,</span><span class="font14"> W. F. Albright writes: “The narratives of the patriarchs, of Moses and the exodus, of the conquest of Canaan, of the judges, the monarchy, exile and restoration, have all been confirmed and illustrated to an extent that I should have thought impossible forty years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, it is not to be expected that archaeology is going to produce evidence of confirmation for every line of the Scriptures, Nor should we make our acceptance of the record dependent on such confirmation. If we do, then archaeology has become our god, it has become the voice that tells us what is good and bad, and we worship it Remember that archaeology does not fully present ancient history. Comparatively few objects have been preserved through the centuries and even in the case of those that have been preserved, the interpretation of their significance may be difficult. In certain fields of knowledge archaeology gives much information. But would you expect to find in Egypt a monument to commemorate the deliverance of the Israelites from the power of Pharaoh? Nations do not build monuments to record their failures. However, as reason would suggest, there are far more records pertaining to the conquests of Palestine by the Assyrian and Babylonian rulers. That is the sort of thing monarchs celebrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Taking into consideration all the evidence that has come to light, the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font14"> Book Review of January 11, 1959, quoted Nelson Glueck assaying: “No archaeological discovery has ever controverted a Biblical reference.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Bible—Divine Revelation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, the Bible is accurate, but it is much more than a book that contains accurate history and reliable statements of science. Before men had dug into the earth to establish the time-order of creation, it was recorded in the Bible, and geology has been able to do nothing but confirm it. The rise and fall of human governments was foretold hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of years in advance. The unfolding of history has simply confirmed the reliability of the Bible account. (See the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Your Will Be Done on Earth&quot;)</span><span class="font14"> How could men relate in detail the account of a creation that no man was alive to see? How could they see into the future to know the course that would be taken by world governments? Man could not, except by divine revelation. Since the Bible contains such information, it could not possibly be of human origin. It is the Word of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Being convinced that the Bible is God's Word, there is no reason to spend our lives trying to produce evidence to confirm it. Now that you know where the truth is found, spend your time studying it. “Keep, strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked. On this account cease becoming unreasonable, but go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.” (Eph. 5:1517) Your faith in God and his Word will grow far stronger by gaining an accurate knowledge of the Bible than by studying the evidence that men may produce to confirm it. The reasonable course is to study the Bible and wisely walk in the way that it directs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font13">HE family is under pressure as never before from the inside and the outside, from one end of the world to the other. Powerful forces are at work striking at the very heart of family life, threatening its existence. The vise of nationalism, the industrial revolution, the cry for independence, new outlooks on' sex and life, have all exercised an overwhelming influence on the family way of living, rocking its very foundations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Down through the ages, in the Semitic, Babylonian, Egyptian, Persian and Roman civilizations, the family changed little. But in the last hundred years of the modern world, drastic changes have swept the family circle, causing great concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In those ancient civilizations agriculture was the primary way of life. The father ruled as head, and children respected his authority. Obedience was the first rule of the house. It was demanded. So powerful were families that they could sell their own children and even have them put to death. The family had complete control over choice of marriage partner, education, place of residence and work. Women had no voice or choice but to marry and to perform the duties of marriage. Families grew up together, lived together, worked together and fought together. A good share of the recreation was at home and between families. The home was the center of religious instruction. Families sang, prayed and worshiped together. Divorce was looked down upon. Those getting a divorce were considered to be breaking God’s law. While none of these things have disappeared entirely from family life, yet their combined influence is not the same any more. The pattern of living has changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So great have been the changes in family life in recent years that some students of the family believe that the only function left for the institution is purely sentimental and “affectional.” And a good many sociologists are of the opinion that ^the family is on the way out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The influence of the family on the future of nations and the world is so important that it cannot be ignored. Many historians believe that the first factor in the downfall of the Grecian and Roman civilizations was family deterioration. And some people, fearful that such may actually happen to the Western world, advocate a return to old ways in order to save the family and the present way of life. Are their fears unfounded? What do the facts show?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasons for Concern</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Within our lifetime we have seen threatening changes take place in family life. Instead of an agricultural society we have an industrial one. In the old agricultural society togetherness was possible. Families worked out in the fields together, ate their meals at home together, played and worshiped together. But in today’s industrial society most of that has been changed. Industry separates the father from his family a good portion of the waking hours</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">of the work-week. Children spend much time away from home at school and lunch out. Recreation has become a gigantic commercial business. Religious teaching has passed out of the hands of the parents to churches and religious agencies. Social activities take one away from the home. One out of five mothers with dependent children is now employed outside the home. Reportedly more married women than single women are now in the working force. Consequently families are seldom together any more and parental authority is almost nonexistent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Dr. John J. Kane, head of the sociology department at the University of Notre Dame, declared that today “the occupation of father is almost as obsolete as harness maker or blacksmith.” And more often than we would like to admit we hear statements about mothers “abdicating their traditional role.” Once it was economically profitable to a man to have a wife and children. Today, they are a financial burden to him. Furthermore, a wife can support herself and is not dependent on a husband. Strong religious and social pressures that once kept couples together have all but dissipated. So weak is the bond between parent and child today that a married man or woman often feels no obligation to honor his father and mother. When the married couple has to share a house with aged parents this is generally regarded as a tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Revolutions and wars keep families in constant turmoil. Military service and war take young men and girls away from their families. Anticolonial drives have forced many to leave their homes, disrupting family life. Hundreds of thousands of refugees jam the Middle East. Everywhere people are on the move. In the United States some 8,000,000 children moved from home to home in 1951. One fifth of the native population lives in a different state from </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">its birth and one out of every five adults changes Ma residence each year. This constant Shifting of population has a tendency to drive a wedge between young married people and their respective parental families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The instability of family life is reflected in the literature of our day. In fact, one observer stated that a foreigner reading popular novels and magazines printed in the United States about its life would “picture the American family circle as an assemblage of delinquents and neurotics— flying apart at the seams under the influence of TV, Kinsey Reports and divorcecourt scandals.” Of course, this is not an altogether true picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Attitude* Toward Marriage</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The true family picture both in the United States and in other parts of the world, however, is not a flattering one. In the United States between 1938-48, there was a “50 percent increase in the number of children born outside marriage.” In Sweden’s population of some 7,000,000 “there are 27,000 illegitimate children a year”; and “of every 10 Swedish women now being married, seven have conceived at least one child before reaching the altar.” Illegitimacy is high also in other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As for the divorce rate, in Sweden it has risen “by more than 100 percent in the past decade and by 1,000 percent in the past half century.” Recent reports from England show that from “about 5,000 per annum in 1937, the divorce rate actually multiplied by ten in ten years!” The average number of divorces for every hundred marriages in the United States in the 1881-90 decade had increased 466 percent by the 1940-49 decade. Approximately one out of every four marriages ends this way today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the last forty years the rate of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">divorce has climbed rapidly in the Netherlands, Denmark, France and in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font13"> for February 2, 1959, reports on the new elite class in Russia, saying: &quot;Divorces are more frequent and casual than in the other classes, and if a rich girl is indiscreet, the family doctor probably can be depended on to set matters straight and observe a worldly silence.” Indeed, the divorce rate has risen so high that, with the extension of average lifeexpectancy, divorce has temporarily replaced death as the main way in which marriages end. Especially is this true in industrial lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The proportion of broken families depends not only on legal divorce but also on separation, desertion and death. In the United States some 7,000,000 children under the age of eighteen live with only one parent, or neither. Because of desertion, more than 250,000 families are receiving government assistance. This involves nearly 1,000,000 women and children and it costs the American taxpayers $276,342,000 a year. However, this is relatively only a small part of the over-all problem since but 22 percent of family desertion cases come to the attention of public assistance agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Juvenile Delinquency</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover said: ‘Selfindulgence and placing pleasure before duty on a vast and growing scale have become a phenomenon of this adult world. &quot;These are warning symptoms of the ‘decadence disease,’ ’’ he stated, “which has contributed to the decay of so many civilizations throughout history.” Right now these are undermining family life by fostering undisciplined and immoral youth. &quot;These children,” said Hoover, “are victims in a very real sense. They are the victims of a society which has substituted indulgence for discipline. They are the victims of a breakdown of authority and moral standards in the home, in the neighborhood and—too frequently—in the entire community. And they are the victims of those practitioners of expediency who have blurred the lines between right and wrong, good and evil. So in large part the juvenile delinquent is a. by-product of a self-indulgent age.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The United States is facing an emergency and its very future is being threatened because of juvenile delinquency. Throughout this nation, an estimated 740,-000 youngsters under eighteen years of age were arrested in 1957. Hoover says: “Since 1952, our juvenile population has increased approximately 22 percent. Juvenile arrests in the same period have risen 55 percent!” “By 1962 one million of our teen-agers will be arrested each year—at the present rate,” he said. He pointed out that “delinquency is a world-wide disease” and not just a situation peculiar to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Strengthening the Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is no question that family life needs strengthening, but how? There must be a going back to basic principles that make for wholesome family living. The Bible provides these principles. To be helpful they must be applied. Note what it has to say about husband and wife relationship: “You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord.” And again: “The wife should have deep respect for her husband.” If the wife so deports herself she is not a boss or a leader. And if she does so deport herself willingly and gladly, knowing that it is to her best interest, then the family gains strength from the harmony that such conduct creates. Think of the many differences and heartaches such willing submission would eliminate.—Col. 3:18; Eph. 5: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To the husbands the Bible says: “You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.” If husbands would obey this injunction, what a blessing it would be to wives! “In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh, but he feeds and cherishes it.” Husbands are not to abuse wives, but are to provide for them and love them tenderly. They are to enjoy their wives and not go about seeking other men’s wives or other women. “Why, my son, should you be ravished with the wife of another, and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?” Let your wife’s “breasts intoxicate you always, with her love be continually ravished.” The marriage bond is sacred and the marriage bed is not to be defiled. “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.”—Col. 3:19; Eph. 5:28, 29; Prov. 5:15-20, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">AT;</span><span class="font14"> Heb. 13:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Bible also speaks plainly about parent-child relationship. “And you, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.” Note, it says “fathers” are to take the lead in instructing the children. Mothers are to assist in the training. So much juvenile delinquency could be avoided if fathers seized hold of this responsibility, instead of passing it on to their wives. At best the wife can do only half the job.—Eph. 6:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To the children the Bible commands: “You children, be obedient to your parents in everything, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.&quot; It is a known fact that if parents fulfill their role, children will more often fulfill theirs. To parents who set the right example, and who properly discharge their obligation, delinquency is no problem. —Col. 3:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now if families would follow these instructions closely, life would be much happier for them. Delinquency problems would faide away, divorces and broken homes would no doubt be saved, feelings of anxiety and frustration would be eliminated. To the extent that God’s ways are applied, to that extent the family is made happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We have living proof that Bible principles work toward creating a stronger and happier family tie. This evidence we have in the family life of Jehovah’s witnesses. Even though they are subjected to the same pressures, strains and stresses of this modern world, still they have not succumbed to its delinquent attitudes toward marriage and family relationships. Their family life is rich and wholesome, because together they sincerely endeavor to apply the wise counsel of God’s Word in their lives. They place their worship first. Daily together they study the Bible. Together they go to congregation meetings several times a week. This worshipful togetherness has united them not only as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font14"> family, but also as part of a New World society of people in which there are no social inequalities, racial prejudices or nationalism. These divisive factors they have replaced with the unifying and binding quality of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Happy family home life can be your happy lot and the lot of every family on earth. The requirement is simple—apply Bible principles in your life. Associate with the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, where these principles are applied. Boiled down to a few words, strengthening the family is a matter of learning about and respecting the Author of the family, namely, Jehovah God. It amounts to loving God exclusively and one’s family as oneself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">NATURE HAD IT</span></p><img src="g_E_19570522_files/g_E_19570522-8.png" alt="" style="width:213pt;height:97pt;">
<p><span class="font13">HEN we hear of such creatures as the hammerhead shark, the swordfish,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">the sawfish and the shoebill stork, we tend to think of the aptness of these names. We tend to give man the credit for cleverness, ignoring this fact: Long before man even thought of a hammer, a sword, a saw or a shoe, nature had them first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, long before man thought of a lot of clever things, nature had them first: Spiders were building hinged doors; ants were building cities; hornets were insulating their houses; wasps were making paper; beavers were building dams and canals; eagles and vultures were using telescopes to spot their prey; African jerboas had snowshoes; polar- bears were wearing nonskid soles; ducks were enjoying the benefits of waterproofing; ants were building pontoon bridges; poisonous snakes were winning a living with hypodermic needles; white pelicans were fishing with scoop nets and electric eels were using the power of storage batteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Almost any field of human endeavor, in fact, would reveal instances of nature’s having it first, even instances where nature’s creatures have complex and ingenious built-in devices that still puzzle man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Let us take for an example the field of aeronautics. The most modern aircraft today are jet-propelled, using the rocket principle as a means of locomotion. Yet long before man thought of jet-propelled or rocket-powered aircraft, nature had living jets and living rockets—the amazing octopuses and squids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">An octopus is born with built-in jet apparatus. This is called the funnel or siphon. Behind the funnel is the mantle cavity, into which the funnel opens. This jet of the sea takes water into the mantle cavity, after which he closes the entrance by a special con</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">trivance. Then follows a powerful contraction of the mantle muscles that shoots the water out through the funnel, causing the octopus to be jet-propelled in the opposite direction, backwards. The squid even looks like a rocket. Its propulsion system is even more remarkable. This ten-armed creature can turn its funnel for propulsion in either direction, forward or backward, so having greater jet maneuverability than the octopus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Man’s desire to fly was no doubt prompted by watching birds and bats soar through the air. It appears that nature’s aviators are still ahead of man. Said zoologist Ivan Sanderson: “The aerodynamics of bats drive engineers mad and are quite beyond us ordinary mortals.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Nature’s Helicopters and Gliders</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Did you ever see a dragonfly? If so, then your impression of a man-made helicopter may be that of a monstrous dragonfly. And it would be a fitting comparison, for the dragonfly is insectdom’s living helicopter. The dragonfly can twist and turn, shoot straight up, hover, even move backward on the wing! Nature</span></p><img src="g_E_19570522_files/g_E_19570522-9.png" alt="" style="width:175pt;height:73pt;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The hummingbird, nature’s helicopter, is the only bird able to fly backward. </span><span class="font14">“When the hummer converts to helicopter flight, as in hovering,” says Dr, Charles H. Blake, “it then inverts the wing on the back stroke. While in helicopter flight it determines its direction of progress by the same general method as a helicopter. It cants the rotor [wings]. Doubtless this is how sideways flight is accomplished.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Long before man built a glider plane nature had many kinds of living gliders, such as the sea gull and the flying squirrel. The squirrel’s gliding equipment is folds of loose skin covered with fine, close-lying fur. This special skin extends from the animal’s sides and legs. When ready to launch itself into space, this living glider climbs to the top of a tree. It takes off, spread-eagling its long legs. The squirrel controls speed and direction by changing the position of its gliding membranes and also by use of its tail. A flying squirrel taking off from the top of a 150-foot-high tree can glide through the air for 150 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Australia’s glider-possums can make long-distance flights with ease, covering about 200 feet. One glider-possum was observed to sail from the top of a tree 100 feet high and glide to the foot of another tree, 210 feet away. It then climbed to the summit of the tree and glided to the foot of another. It made six glides, covering a distance of 590 yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another of nature’s gliders is the flying snake of Asia. Holding its body straight and rigid and pushing its ribs outward so as to present a concave surface to the air, the flying snake glides safely to the earth from places of considerable height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Nature’s best glider? It seems to be the flying fish. &quot;With favorable winds,” says Dr. Leonard P. Schultz, “they have been observed going as far as 1,200 feet at a height of 25 feet, and in play it is not unusual for them to rise to 30 feet. The great</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">est flight height recorded is 36 feet above the surface of the water.” Their record glide In time is said to be forty-two seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One might think that flying in V-forma-tion is a clever idea of man. But the snow geese were flying in V-formation long before man got off the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Landing Gear and Safety Gear</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All kinds of devices in man-made aircraft were found in nature first. Is it retractable landing gear? Why, the birds had it first by their putting their feet straight back and by dropping them when coming in for a landing. Man-made airplanes have lights that flash on and off at night; but nature’s aircraft, the firefly, has been flying at night and flashing its light on and off for countless centuries. &quot;This lantern equipment is one of those efficient, matter-of-fact inventions,” says Rutherford Platt, “that science can’t precisely figure out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Many birds have a built-in safety device on their wings. This is a small group of feathers called the alula. “These come into operation,” says Frank Lane in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Nature Parade,</span><span class="font14"> “when the attack angle, or tilt, of the wings is very high, and the bird is in danger of losing lift or stalling. The alula then acts as a safety device. Actually it was not until Sir Frederick Handley Page invented the now famous 'slotted wing’ anti-stalling device, which has done so much to make airplanes safer, that it was realized that birds have had in the alula the same safety gear from time immemorial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bat’s “RadaP* Prevents Crashes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For greater safety in avoiding collisions many airplanes now carry radar. But bats had a perfect system of “radar” (or, rather, &quot;sonar”) long before man ever conceived of such a thing. A flying bat utters a</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">continuous rhythm of sounds, pitched in a key too high for human ears to recognize. The sound waves are thrown back to the bat by objects around it. These sound waves are picked up by the bat, thanks to its large microphonic ears. Then the bat’s exquisitely balanced neuro-muscular flight controls automatically go into action and cause a saving zoom or swerve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In man-made radar there is an arrangement that prevents confusion between signals being sent out and their echoes coming back. Thus the only signals the receiver ever “hears” are the echoes bounding back from a distant object. But the bat had this clever arrangement first. At the precise moment the bat sends out its high-pitched sound, there is a contraction of a tiny ear muscle that puts the ear out of action, so that the bat’s hearing is not temporarily paralyzed by the loudness of its own squeak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The bat’s “radar” is so complex that some things about it are still not known with great clarity. Just how does a bat, for instance, distinguish echoes reflected by obstacles to be avoided from those reflected by insects that are being sought? A bat will dive toward a small stone thrown into the air, but it will avoid the stone by a swerve at the last moment. The bat’s audio-location mechanism is truly delicate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Never is there a crash when the bat’s “radar” is on. Even when tens of thousands of bats mill around for hours in a dark cave, there are no collisions. Each bat apparently recognizes its own signals and does not confuse them with those of its neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Eel’s Device Puzzles Scientists</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Not only bats have marvelous detection devices but also certain fish. A small West African fish that swims backward in muddy waters much of the time has a kind of radar set in its tail. Some of fishdom's detection devices are not really understood by man. Under the heading &quot;How Eel Detects Distant Objects by Electricity .Puzzles Scientists,” the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font13"> of June 12, 1957, said in a news report of the preceding day from Ridgefield, Connecticut: “A newly discovered and mysterious ability of the electric eel to detect objects at a distance under water was pondered by a hundred scientists here this morning. The eel, it was reported, can locate objects under water in a manner believed to be different from that of radar, sonar or magnetic detection devices. Even smail eels can send out electrical charges and thus locate objects with precision at a distance of up to twenty feet, according to Dr. Christopher Coates, director of the New York Aquarium....</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Dr. Coates reported that the South American electric eel . . . lies on the bottom sending out a small electrical signal in pulses that occur at the rate of about twenty a second. When the animal is excited by a stone, fish or other object in the water, it increases its signal rate to about fifty or sixty pulses a second. At the same time, the animal’s body becomes covered with depressions. The depressions play a part in the eel’s detection device. . . . Dr. John H. Heller, director of the New England Institute for Medical Research, said he believed the Navy would give several battleships to know how the eel does it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So even in regard to modem devices of this electronic and rocket age, it can be said that nature had many of the principles for their operation first. In some cases man has not yet fathomed the complexities of nature’s devices. To whom goes the credit for all this infinite wisdom seen in nature? To Jehovah God, the Designer and Inventor of all these natural wonders. “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made.”—Ps. 104:24.</span></p>

We boast of 103,000,000 church</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">members associated with our American churches,” he continued, &quot;but if they were subjected to the tests that Gideon applied at God’s direction millions would melt away.&quot;—New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font14"> January 5, 1959. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Preaching at New York city's fashionable Riverside Church, Dr. MacLennan of Rochester, New York, condemned the modern tendency to view religion as a capsule that can be taken to cure every situation without intellectual effort and moral heroism, and emphasized that it took a ‘dynamic, Biblical Christianity to make sense out of modern living.’—New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font14">January 19, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Speaking for Catholics, a writer in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Mind,</span><span class="font14"> January-February, 1959, stated that &quot;too many parishioners are trying to live adult Catholic lives with a child’s knowledge of their religious principles,” and that as the yeans go by Catholics should know more about their own religion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">The foregoing complaints call to mind what the apostle Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians. These, in view of the time, should have been teachers, but they still needed to be fed on spiritual milk instead of solid food. “Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” Continuing, he urged them to “press on to maturity,” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 5:11 to 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, since the Bible likens Christians to spiritual soldiers fighting a spiritual war against the forces of darkness, they must be mature. For them </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">to be effective they </span><span class="font14">must be strong, skilled, fully equipped. They must be able to heed the command: &quot;Stand firm in the faith, carry on as men, grow mighty,”—1 Cor. 16:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Evidence of Christian Maturity</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Why such a lack of maturity today? Is it because modem conditions make it well-nigh impossible to comply with the above</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Scriptural commands? We might think so were it not for the example given by the Christian witnesses of Jehovah. They prove that Christian maturity is possible today. Even their opponents admit as much in their efforts to shame their people into emulating the zeal of the witnesses. A typical instance of this appeared in the (Roman Catholic) Central California </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Register, </span><span class="font13">September 5, 1958. Among other things the writer stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“The Witness movement requires that everyone in it give bold, constant evidence of his witness convictions. If you are a witness everyone you come in contact with will be told about it. . . . You are always intense about it and always letting people know about it . . - And you unapologetically live your convictions.” He then contrasted this with the way Catholics usually feel and act: “Ours is a society and culture in which it has somehow become not good form, not polite, not intelligent to stress one's religious commitment. One may privately prize it and adhere to it as much as one likes, but to make any show of it is held to be naive or fanatical.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What kind of Christian soldiers are these who are so timid in the face of mere adverse public opinion? What can be expected of them when brought face to face with totalitarian persecution? No wonder that in Iron Curtain countries these give their support to the godless Communist regimes in spite of the ostensible position of their church, all of which is further evidence of immaturity. That it is not expecting too much for Christians to stand firm in the face of such persecution can be seen by the example given by the Christian witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thus in writing of totalitarian efforts to degrade the human spirit, authors have time and again noted the steadfast example of the witnesses. Among such is Professor Ebenstein of Princeton University, who, in his book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The New State,</span><span class="font13"> wrote: “When the witnesses did not give up the struggle for their religious convictions, a campaign of terror was launched against them which surpassed anything perpetrated against other victims of Nazism in Germany. . . . The sufferings of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the camps were even worse than those meted out to Jews, pacifists or Communists. Small as the sect is, each member seems to be a fortress which can be destroyed but never taken.” That is Christian maturity—standing so firm that one never compromises!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The 1959 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook of Jehovah's</span><span class="font13"> Witnesses gives eloquent testimony that the same spirit is manifested by the witnesses presently in Iron Curtain lands. There the witnesses maintain their integrity by one-hundred-percent neutrality, refusing to vote and to accept military service and at the same time fulfilling their commission to preach by doing so underground. As a result the largest single group of witnesses in the world outside the United States is found in an Iron Curtain country, and in the past year the number of witnesses in all lands behind the Iron Curtain increased more than 20 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth of God's</span><span class="font13"> Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What accounts for all these manifestations of Christian maturity? One factor is that quality and maturity, rather than numbers, are stressed by the witnesses. Merely wanting to be baptized and to be known as a witness is not enough. Because in certain lands, such as Korea and parts of Africa, the witnesses are looked up to, it has been found necessary to screen very carefully all who would become witnesses, making sure that they have had at least six months’ instruction in the Word of God and have the right motive in wanting to become witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Without a knowledge and understand-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ing of God’s Word Christian maturity is impossible. As we read: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work”; in other words, mature.—2 Tim. 3:16, 17,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Only the Bible gives us a vision of a God whom we can worship: perfect in power, wisdom, justice and love. Only it gives us a satisfactory explanation of the cause of evil and why God has permitted it to continue down to our day and why he is certain to make an end of it in the near future. All such knowledge is indispensable if Christians are to have the faith, hope and love needed for them to be strong and mature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">God’s Word also gives us basic principles to govern our lives, which Jesus summed up in the two great commandments: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength,” and, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” Then by use of logic, illustrations and examples the Bible imparts a powerful conviction that to obey these principles is the right, the wisest as well as the most loving thing to do, resulting in the greatest possible good to others and ourselves.—Mark 12:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Can any person merely by reading the Bible and pondering over its meaning gather these truths from the Bible? No, the Bible shows that to gain this understanding and appreciation from its pages requires the aid of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Visible Christian Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This fact is overlooked by many and yet nothing<sup>1</sup> could be clearer. That is why it was necessary for Jesus to open up and interpret the Scriptures to the two disciples he met on the way to Emmaus on his resurrection morning. (Luke 24:13-35) It makes clear why it was necessary for Philip the evangelist to explain Isaiah’s prophecy to the Ethiopian returning from worshiping in Jerusalem. (Acts 8:27-39) That is why it was necessary for the apostles and older men at Jerusalem to come together, to ascertain the divine will regarding the eating of meats offered to idols, fornication and blood, all of which Christians were to abstain from. (Acts 15: 1-30) That is also why it was necessary for Aquila and Priscilla to instruct Apollos ‘more correctly concerning the way of God,’ and why the new converts at Ephesus needed further instruction by the apostle Paul. (Acts 18:25, 26; 19:1-7) All these were familiar with the Scriptures, but they needed help to understand them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Also showing the direct connection between a visible Christian organization and Christian maturity are Paul’s words: “And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, sopie as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ, until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of the growth that belongs to the fullness of the Christ; in order that we should no longer be babes.”—Eph. 4:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And how does this visible organization of witnesses aid persons of good will toward God to attain to Christian maturity? To begin with there is weekly personal Bible instruction in the home by a mature minister, which personal instruction may last from six months to a year or more as the need may be. The student is encouraged to prepare his lessons in advance, to learn to express himself in his own words and, as opportunity affords, to tell others about the things he has learned. As he</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">progresses he is encouraged to associate regularly with a weekly group Bible study held In his neighborhood and to attend the four congregational meetings held in a centrally located Kingdom Hall. These meetings are each an hour in length and make use of various methods of instruction to bring Christians to maturity as regards doctrine, conduct and teaching ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Over each congregation a mature Christian minister presides as an overseer, and he, in turn, has six assistants to aid him in looking after the various features of the Christian educational program. So that the overseer and his servants may be able to give each individual in the congregation the needed personal attention, congregations are limited to not more than two hundred witnesses. When a congregation exceeds that number it is divided into two. Not to be overlooked in this program for attaining Christian maturity are the many publications, Bibles, Bible textbooks and religious journals such as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font13">as well as the various assemblies. All this Christian training is done under the direction of the governing body of the Watch Tower Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However, in addition to God’s Word and a visible Christian organization something else is needed before Christians can “become full-grown in powers of understanding” and able “to distinguish both right and wrong.” (1 Cor. 14:20; Heb. 5:14) And what is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Holy Spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, even as it takes not only good seed and hard work but also favorable weather for crops to mature properly, so likewise for Christian maturity it takes not only the seed of God’s Word and a visible organization but also God’s holy spirit, as we read: “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith Jehovah,” (Zech.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">4:6, AS) In passing, let it be noted that God’s holy spirit is no third person of an incomprehensible “trinity,” but is God’s active force that he bestows upon his servants so that they can accomplish his purposes regardless of what these may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thus we find that it was only after Jesus was baptized and God's holy spirit in the form of a dove descended upon him that he was empowered to begin his ministry; even as it was only after God poured out his spirit upon the 120 disciples that they began to preach to all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To receive God’s holy spirit we need to study his Word and associate with his visible organization. More than that, we must also pray for it and manifest “obedient hearing by faith,” even as Jesus and the apostle Paul show. All three of these, the Word, the organization and God’s spirit, are indispensable to our attaining Christian maturity.—Luke 11:13; Gal. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thus we can see why there is such a lack of maturity among professed Christians, as freely admitted by religious leaders, and why some Christians are mature. If we would be effective as Christian warriors and receive God’s approval we must progress to Christian maturity.

<p><span class="font21">A</span><span class="font14">LL of us are space travelers whether we realize it or not. In one year we journey approximately 186 million miles through space at a speed of 66,600 miles an hour. Our space ship is the earth. No better vehicle for space travel could be devised. It does not cramp us but gives us more than enough room; its atmosphere shields us from dangerous radiation and protects us from collisions with speeding meteorites; it supplies us with an abundance of food, water and oxygen; it maintains a comfortable temperature; and it takes care of many other needs. What more could a space traveler want?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Man is a creature that not only has a great amount of curiosity but also an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. As the earth has carried him through space he has watched its traveling companion, the moon, with keen interest. He has studied it through large telescopes and wondered of what materials it is made, whether it has a molten core, what caused its innumerable craters, what its huge dark areas are, whether its surface has a layer of thick dust or hard lava, and what is on its other side which we never see. He has manifested a similar curiosity about the eight planets that, along with the earth, are included in our solar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is much man would like to know about these eight planets, but his research has been made difficult by the manner in which the earth’s atmosphere distorts telescopic images of them. It also prevents an accurate spectrum analysis of their atmospheres. The only way to obtain an unobstructed view would be to suspend telescopes high above the earth's surface. Until recently this seemed impossible, but now it is within the realm of possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the past few years rockets have opened a new door in man’s quest for knowledge about the solar system and the universe. They can replace guesses with facts. By probing far out into space they can gather information on radiation, temperature, dust and many other things that will give us a clearer understanding of space. They also can be used to study the moon and Earth’s planetary neighbors at close range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">How Rockets Function</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To understand how rockets are able to expand our knowledge of God’s heavenly creations it is necessary to know something about how they function. Unlike airplanes that must have air in which to operate, rockets function best where there is no air. Air resistance slows them down. They carry what oxygen they need for burning their fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some people mistakenly think that a rocket moves by pushing against the air,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">but this is not so. If that were true it could not operate in space where there is no air. It is designed in such a fashion that hot gases are expelled at a high rate of speed from an opening in its rear. The expelling of these gases kicks it forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We might illustrate the principle on which it-works by a man standing in a light canoe. If he throws Stones with all his might, the canoe will move. The same is true if he jumps from the canoe to the shore. His action of jumping out will cause the canoe to move in the opposite direction. This phenomenon is explained by Newton’s third law of motion, which says: “To every force there is an equal and opposite reaction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By increasing the quantity of gases expelled as well as their velocity the speed of the rocket can be increased or bigger loads can be lifted. Once a rocket is out of the atmosphere and is free from the earth’s gravitational pull it can coast indefinitely without further power. In order to maneuver it, however, or to increase its speed only small amounts of power are needed. An ion engine would do the job well.. One is being developed that could accelerate a space-traveling rocket to fantastic speeds by merely ejecting small streams of charged atoms at high velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Outside vanes or fins are required on a rocket only if it operates in the earth’s atmosphere. Above ten miles, where the air is thin, these control surfaces are ineffective. Control vanes can be placed in or against a rocket’s exhaust stream to stabilize it. Other methods use jets in the rocket’s side or use a rocket engine that moves on a gimbal. The gimbal makes it possible to change the direction of the rocket’s thrust to stabilize it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Satellites</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By means of rockets man has succeeded in putting a number of instrumented satellites into orbit about the earth. This was done by lifting them to a height of about 200 miles and then increasing their velocity to 18,000 miles an hour. At this speed the gravitational pull of the earth is counterbalanced, A lesser speed would allow the rocket to be pulled down to the earth. A greater speed would lengthen its elliptical orbit. Satellites at higher altitudes require less speed to stay up. A satellite can coast around the earth for weeks, months or years, depending upon its size and altitude. The amount of air resistance it encounters determines the rate at which it slows down and, consequently, its total time in orbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Now that heavy satellites have been put in orbit astronomers are looking forward to seeing telescopes circling the earth. That would give them an undistorted view of the heavens. For the first time the planets and our moon could be examined by powerful telescopes hanging high in the sky. What they would see would be in crisp detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The telescopes could televise or telemeter their findings down to the earth. Stabilizing equipment could be attached to them so that they could be focused on any desired spot. The day may come when not only optical telescopes can be put in orbit but also giant radio-telescopes. At present the largest radio-telescope on earth has an antenna 250 feet in diameter. It is hoped that a much larger one with an antenna one thousand feet across can be constructed several hundred miles above the earth. Very little bracing would be needed, because objects in orbit are weightless. By putting these great eyes and ears outside the earth’s envelope of air, man's knowledge of God’s heavenly creations would increase immensely, because he would be able to use the entire electromagnetic spectrum instead of a small fraction of it. It would</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">be like pulling back the curtains on an immense picture window.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some scientists have suggested that a space laboratory be put in orbit. They recommend a 400-ton laboratory at an altitude of 500 miles. They propose that its pieces be shot into orbit by rockets and then brought together and assembled by men working in small “astro-tugs” or special space suits. Its shape would be that of a giant five-spoked wheel. By causing the laboratory to spin about its axis centrifugal force would act as artificial gravity for the ten men whom they hope to station in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Satellites should make fine weather stations, From their high vantage point they could spot the formation of storms and keep man informed on the course the storms take. They would be invaluable for weather study and weather forecasting. Other satellites could be used for quickly transmitting communications between distant parts of the earth, and still others are planned for extending the range of TV broadcasts. Without a doubt satellites can be valuable servants to man as well as valuable tools for gaining knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Interplanetary Travel</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A speed of seven miles a second must be attained for a rocket to break free from the earth’s gravitational pull. It will then coast away from the earth. If it is shot in the direction of the moon it must be timed so that it will reach the moon’s orbit when the moon is in that particular spot. By firing a forward-pointing rocket the moon missile can be slowed sufficiently for the moon’s weak gravity to pull it into orbit. As it circles the moon a television camera could give man a close-up view of the moon’s surface and his first look at the far side of the moon. At the same time other instruments would be telemetering their findings back to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A rocket sent to Venus could gather information about that planet that is impossible to get from earth. It might solve the mystery of Venus’ cloud covering by descending into the clouds and analyzing them. Man does not know of what they consist. Neither does he know what is below them. The rocket might answer the question of whether the surface of Venus is a desert or an ocean. Other rockets might make similar investigations of the giant cloud-covered planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is much more practical to send instrumented rockets on such space trips than a manned rocket. Instruments do not mind traveling in cramped quarters for years at a time; neither do they mind if they do not return to earth. A round trip to another planet would take a long time. For example, Mars is about 35 million miles away at its nearest point to Earth. A round trip, including a waiting period until Earth and Mars draw close again, would require about two years and eight months. This is a long time for a man to remain in the cramped space of a rocket. Even if a landing could be made the planet could not support human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It would not take nearly as long to go to the moon, but the problem of survival is just as great. The moon has no atmosphere, and that means there is no water and no protection from solar radiations. Astronomer Gerard Kuiper believes that the moon is extremely radioactive. If man dared to land he would have to have protective shielding as well as enough fuel to get off the moon and to make the trip of 222,000 miles back to Earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Special equipment is required to send a man to the moon and back. It has been estimated that such a trip would cost two billion dollars. It would be much easier and far less expensive to send instrumented rockets. They do not require food and</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">oxygen and do not mind getting lost or destroyed. They could probably do a better job of gathering information. Regarding the matter of sending men into space Doctor Fred L. Whipple, director of the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said: “Men will only be an expensive luxury in space, except possibly for maintenance work and actual exploration of the moon and planets. Telepuppets, with TV eyes and remote-controlled fingers, may even excel man for these duties. Board and room are horribly expensive in space, not to mention travel costs, while telepuppets enjoy vacuum, disregard cosmic rays, rarely become ill or bored and need not be fed when off duty.” It seems best for man to stay on the earth and let instruments do the interplanetary traveling-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Earth Is Man's Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">From man’s beginning the earth has had the role of a space-traveling home for him. The arrival of the rocket age has not changed that role. Even if man succeeds in improving his rockets to the point where space travel would be less expensive and less dangerous, that does not mean a grand migration from Earth will start Neither does it mean that people will want to spend their vacations strolling over the inconceivably bleak terrain of the moon where temperatures fluctuate from 238 degrees Fahrenheit below zero during the two-week-long lunar night to 212 degrees above during the long day. The coldest and most desolate spot on earth, or the hottest, would be pleasant compared with what the moon has to offer. The same can be said for practically all the planets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The more information man gathers from his space probes the more evident it should become that the earth was designed for man and that it is an ideal home. There is none better. Notwithstanding imaginative predictions about building cities on other planets or on the moon, it stands to reason that people are not going to move from an ideal home to a desolate, inhospitable waste. Such places are'not for humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The earth was designed and created for man. It was thoughtfully provided with everything man needs to be comfortable and to flourish. The earth’s Creator gave man the responsibility of being its caretaker. This is revealed by what the earth’s Maker said to the first man regarding the garden of Eden: &quot;God blessed them and God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it.’ ” (Gen. 1:28) And in the second chapter of Genesis it is written: &quot;Jehovah God proceeded to take the man and settle him in the garden of Eden to cultivate it and to take care of it.”—Gen. 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">God’s original purpose for man and for the earth will be fulfilled despite man’s disobedience to his Maker and despite his efforts to ruin the earth. By means of his kingdom God will &quot;bring to ruin those ruining the earth” and will give it as an everlasting possession to those who love him. “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”—Rev. 11:18; Ps. 37:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Under the righteous rule of God’s kingdom man will fulfill his role as earth’s caretaker. The knowledge he will gain from his study of the earth and of the universe will be used for constructive and peaceful purposes. At that time it will be possible to say: &quot;The whole earth has come to rest, has become free of disturbance. People have become cheerful with joyful cries.” (Isa. 14:7) The earth will continue fulfilling its role as man’s spacetraveling home but in a much grander way than it is now, for then it will be a paradise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Chile is a land with almost unlimited variety. It extends 2,653 miles down the Pacific coast of South America from Peru to the southern tip of the continent and averages just over one hundred miles in width. There is plenty of room for its nearly seven million inhabitants and when you come it won’t crowd it any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Let me try to give you just a bird’s-</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">eye </span><span class="font14">view of Chile. The country is largely a valley enclosed between two mountain ranges. To the east are the majestic Andes Mountains, which diminish in height toward the south. Along the Pacific Coast, to the west, is located the Coastal Range. And between them lies the Central Valley, known as one of the garden spots of the world. To the north the land is hot and arid, agriculture is limited, but mineral deposits are rich in this desert land. To the south the country is broken up into many islands along the coast, and rain falls there two out of three days each year. But in central Chile the winter temperature rarely drops below freezing and the summer heat averages only eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit. Ask for any climate; Chile has it. Who could want anything more?</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">If we begin a tour of the country at Santiago, we will be in the capital city and, I should add, by far the largest city in Chile, with about a million and a half population. In a city such as Santiago the buildings are much like those that are found in almost any other city in the world. Here in the central provinces you will find 45 percent of the population concentrated on just 4 percent of the land that is Chile. In the far north there are only four people, on an average, to a square mile of land, and in the cold south that figure may drop to one, but each part of the country has its own attractions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At least half of the agricultural land in Chile is held by large </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">haciendas</span><span class="font14"> or </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">fundos </span><span class="font14">of over 12,000 acres each. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">hacendado</span><span class="font14">the one in charge, may have a fine home on the land, but many of them are engaged in business elsewhere and have left the care of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">hacienda</span><span class="font14"> to an </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">administrador.</span><span class="font14"> Those who work the land are known as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">inquilinos.</span><span class="font14"> They usually are working people who have little education and very little in the way of material possessions. Many live in huts that have little to offer in the way of conveniences or privacy. However, the government and some </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">hacendados</span><span class="font14"> are working to improve the conditions of the people. Housing and education are problems that face people in all</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">parts of the world, and they are not problems that disappear overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Going to the northwest from Santiago will take us to the coastal city of Valparaiso, a place that is built on the hillside as if on ledges. This is the port of call for many ocean-going vessels. East of Valparaiso is Aconcagua—no, not a city, but the highest mountain peak in the Western Hemisphere, towering 23,080 feet into the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Instead of going on to the desert lands of the north, we are going to turn south to see the country. Choose your own mode of travel—train, plane or bus—whatever suits your taste. You will find yourself in the heart of the rich Central Valley, with its fruits, cereals and vineyards. Scenes that you thought were found only in travel folders will be there to greet you. It is about four hundred miles down to the lovely lake region of southern Chile, but travel by modern train makes the trip pleasant. Among the first things to greet you is beautiful Lake Villarrica, which mirrors in its waters a snow-capped volcano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As we continue our trip southward we are treated to a good view of the towering mountains, cascading waterfalls, clearblue lakes and untouched forests that make Chile a land of breathtaking beauty. Soon we reach </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Todos los Santos,</span><span class="font13"> a lake whose name means “All Saints” and is so named because of its exceptional beauty, and towering by it is the volcano Osorno, If you care to, you may ride a boat on this lake to the Argentine border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If we are going to go down into the islands to the south, we will probably travel by boat. Some of the islands we pass are so heavily forested that at places it is almost impossible to penetrate inland. Those who like fish will find them in abundance in the channels as well as in the northern harbors. Whales and seals are also among the visitors to Chilean waters. As we pass icebergs you will be well aware of the fact that you are heading in the direction of the South Pole, but our trip will end at Punta Arenas, known as the southernmost city in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Meeting the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When you come to visit us here in Chile, I would not recommend that you make your trip through the country quite as fast as. the one on which I just took you. Stop and meet the people. You will find them as varied as the country in which they live. Some are Araucanian Indians, many are of Spanish extraction, but you will find others from many parts of Europe. Certain groups speak more than one language, but all of them speak Spanish; it is the language of the country. As you come to know the people you will find that they love freedom, and they have a republican form of government that is growing in maturity. There is ample freedom of the press. While Catholicism is the traditional religion, it is not the state religion; there is freedom of worship for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Among the people you meet, you will find Jehovah’s witnesses in many places. There are about fifteen hundred of them in Chile now. They find many people who have a love of God and who are happy to learn that the new world of righteousness is<sup>1</sup> near at-hand. But they feel that there are many more who have not yet been reached and who will welcome the good news when they hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As you get acquainted with the people you will find that the majority of them live on the large </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">haciendas</span><span class="font13"> and are engaged in agriculture. Depending on the part of the country in which they are located, others raise cattle, work at forestry, fishing or mining. In the cities, of course, there are the jobs that are common</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">to all cities. It is not usually difficult for a man who is dependable and qualified in his line of work to get employment. Progress is also being made in education. Primary education is free, and there are vocational schools and both public and private secondary schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Market</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Shopping for food may be different for you here. Meats are right out in the open, but they are always fresh. They kill one day and sell the next. More and more, though, refrigeration is finding a place. You can go to an almacén (or store) to buy the staples, but greens come from the larger markets. The open-air markets are noisy but fascinating places. They provide an experience you won’t want to miss. Perhaps I should caution you though: We do not haggle over prices. The prices are marked and argument will not change them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The foods we eat here are not usually elaborate. There are bread, beans and potatoes, or the national dish of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">cazuela, </span><span class="font14">which is something like stew, and most of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">inquilines</span><span class="font14"> live on these things. But there are fruits, cereals, other vegetables and many other things that you can add to the menu. In fact, there are some dishes that make my mouth water when I think of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Have you ever heard of the empanada It is traditional with the Chileans. It is a sort of meat pie wrapped in a crusty jacket. The contents are usually meat, olives, onions, raisins and spices. Baked or fried, they are hard to resist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another speciality is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">curanto.</span><span class="font14"> That means “heated rocks,” and it refers to the method of cooking. First the cook makes a rectangular hole in the ground, puts rocks in it and builds a fire on them to heat the rocks. Next the clams and oysters and other sea food are put in, followed by fig leaves to protect the potatoes, then: and greens that follow. On top of these go the chicken, pork, sausages and herbs More leaves, wet cloths, and a topping of sod cover it. It is fascinating to watch, but it is better to taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Planning for the Trip</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When you get to making definite arrangements for your trip, you will be glad to know that anyone from the United States and some European countries can come right into the country on the basis of a passport, without having to get a visa. You can stay for three months, and after that you may have it extended for another three months if you wish. Of course, if you decide to come and stay longer, you will have to get a visa from the Chilean consulate. Who knows, you might stay longer than you plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now about what to bring. Just remember what I have told you about the country and let that be your guide. In the north it is very dry, but it may be cool at night In the central part of the country it is temperate. To the south you are going to find lots of rain and cooler weather. So no matter what kind of clothing you may have, you can use it somewhere in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is a rich experience to live in another country. People have different customs that make them interesting, but once you come to know the people none of them seem foreign. And when they know that you like their country and their way of doing things, you will find many friends among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">My letter has given you just a sample of what you can look forward to. Come to visit us in Chile and see for yourself.</span></p><img src="g_E_19570522_files/g_E_19570522-14.png" alt="" style="width:196pt;height:23pt;">

<p><span class="font0">“They Shall Beat Their Swords into Plowshares”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">F</span><span class="font13">OR thousands of years swords held a prominent place among weapons of war. It is impossible to calculate the number of lives they must have taken. Although modem warriors no longer use swords but employ deadlier weapons, they can still be used as a symbol of all war weapons. They were used as such by the prophet Isaiah when he prophesied of our day. He said: “And it must occur in the final part of the days that the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains, and it will certainly be lifted up above the hills, and to it all the nations must stream. And many peoples will certainly go and say: ‘Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will instruct us about his ways and we will walk in his paths.’ For out of Zion law will </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font13"> forth, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem. And he will certainly render judgment among the nations and set matters straight respecting many peoples. And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any more.&quot; —Isa. 2:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The prophet set the time for the fulfillment of this prophecy by beginning it with the words-. “And it must occur in the final part of the days.” We are living in the “final part of the days” or last days of this world. This is clearly established by other prophecies that have been fulfilled since 1914 (A.D.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It has been during these critical last days that Jehovah God has been judging the people ot all nations. He has been doing this through his Son, Christ Jesus. “When the Son of man arrives in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.”—Matt. 25:31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The result of this separating of the nations has been a flow of good-will people to the highly exalted “house of Jehovah,” the house of his worship. That worship was established high above all worldly governments or centers of worship by the revelation of what Jehovah’s lofty arrangements are for pure worship and by the conforming of Jehovah's witnesses to these by exclusive devotion to God in these last days. The exalting of a truly clean, Scriptural worship to the true God has drawn multitudes to his temple of worship like sheep that are brought into a sheepfold. They form a new-world society on earth that looks forward to the time when the Kingdom will bring the present wicked system of things and its false religions to an end and will exercise complete control of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These people separate from the world by ceasing to think as it does and. to act as it does. They refuse to become involved in its wicked deeds. By becoming a people who are dedicated to God they have transformed their thinking from what it was while they were part of the world. &quot;Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (Rom. 12:2) They bring their</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">thinking into harmony with God’s written Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While a part of the world, they participated in or supported its wars. Many of them possessed the same racial and national hatreds that exist among the peoples of the world and that have caused so much violence and bloodshed. But now that they are in the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses under God’s kingdom they are </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font14">changed people. Instead of hating other races and nationalities they exercise love, as Christ commanded when he said: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Matt. 22:39) No longer are they war-minded. No longer do they use weapons of war. They have done what the prophet Isaiah foretold. They have beaten swords into plowshares and spears into pruning shears. They no longer lift up sword against other people. They learn war no more. By allowing God’s Word to mold their thinking they are able to live in peace the world over. National boundaries and language barriers do not divide them. They are one people, and their trust and hope is in God’s kingdom instead of the political governments of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Hie word of Jehovah has gone forth from his spiritual temple in heavenly Jerusalem. His commands are being carried out by the world-wide preaching of the good news of his kingdom by the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Those who respond to the good news are being taught His ways and are learning how to walk in His paths. That means following a course of obedience and integrity to God as Christ Jesus did. Christ spoke of this as a narrow way that leads to life. “Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.” (Matt. 7:14) The Lord’s sheep who are being gathered into one fold as a new world society have found that </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">narrow</span><span class="font14"> way and are walking along it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because God’s way is not the way the world is going, those who follow it are not popular. The world frequently shows hatred for them, but they are consoled by the fact that Christ was treated in a similar manner. He foretold that this would be so: “If the world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” “Then people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.” —John 15:18,19; Matt. 24:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The peace the New World society now enjoys because of beating “swords into plowshares” will be carried over into the new system of things due to follow the complete end of this old world. Under the rule of God’s kingdom war weapons, as symbolized by swords and spears, will cease to exist. There will be no need for them, because all people living then will have been instructed in God’s Word and will be walking in his righteous paths. They will show love for one another, not hate. Their thoughts will be on things that are good, not on what is evil. They will respect the property and lives of others, not steal and destroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The growing tide of people who are flowing into Jehovah’s New World society is tangible evidence that peoples among the world’s national groups are ‘learning war no more.’ At the time appointed God will rid the earth of the violent who refuse to beat swords into plowshares, and he will give the earth to these meek ones that they may enjoy everlasting peace on a paradise earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">■$&gt; On March. 2 the Soviet Union, in separate notes to Britain, France and the U,S-&gt; agreed to the holding of a foreign ministers' conference on German issues. The Russians requested that representatives of Czechoslovakia and Poland be permitted to sit in on the Soviet side of the parley. Moscow proposed that the conferees discuss the conclude ing of peace treaties with East and West Germany and the converting of West Berlin into a demilitarized independent city. On March 5 Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev indicated that Soviet withdrawal from East Berlin, which had been set for May 27, might be postponed for some time if talks were to convene soon on the German problem. On March 9 Khrushchev suggested that a guard composed either of troops from Britain, France, the U.S. and the Soviet Union or made up of neutral forces might be stationed in West Berlin if it were to become a free city.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Nyasaland: Unrest Continues</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">A state of emergency was declared in Nyasaland on March 3, following many days of rioting and disorder. Additionally, Dr. Hastings Banda, head of the Nyasaland b rah ch of the African National Congress, was deported to Southern Rhodesia on the same day. Banda had been campaigning for the withdrawal of Nyasaland from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. By March 7 it was reported that 249 persons had been arrested, that 39 more had been killed and that over 60 had been wounded since the imposition of the state of emergency only three days earlier. British colonial forces had by that time achieved only partial success in coping with the unrest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&gt; On March 2 Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Sadr announced that his government considers the 1921 treaty signed between Russia and Persia (Iran) to be invalid. Another government spokesman held it to be “obsolete.” One section of the treaty permitted Russia to send forces into Iran in the event that a third party should enter that country and establish military bases there, which would constitute a threat to the Soviet Union. This and a recent announcement by Iran’s Shah that his government would sign a defense pact with the U.S. may be expected to have considerable effect on Soviet-Iranian relations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">•$&gt; The Burmese Chamber of Deputies renominated Gen. Ne Win as premier on February 27, at which time Rangoon's cabinet was also revised. The new regime under Gen. Ne Win had taken control of Burma in a bloodless coup last October. Recent reports indicate that the new government is rounding up and jailing Communists and other dissidents and is taking steps against illegal business and government corruption. It is reported that more than fifty large companies in Burma have had to close down until they repay old government loans. Construction of new buildings and various other improvements are under way in Rangoon. Some sources fear, however, that the Burmese government may soon be beset by serious economic difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">City elections were scheduled throughout France on March 8 and 15, Results from thirteen major cities in the March 8 balloting indicated that the popular vote for the Communists had risen about 19.5 percent, whereas the Gaullist Union for the New Republic had experienced a 21.5 percent-vote drop. March 15 was to mark the second round In the elections and was to involve about 38,000 French communities. A major factor believed to have affected the March 8 vote was the austerity plan instituted by the De Gaulle government in December, The new economic measures included a devaluation </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">01 </span><span class="font13">the franc by 17 percent, cuts in veterans' allowances and certain social security benefits, and an increase in taxes.

<p><span class="font13">Nearing the conclusion of a visit to the Soviet Union British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan ruled out on March 2 the concluding of a nonaggression pact between his nation and Russia. Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev had suggested the negotiation of such a treaty earlier. Ite implementation would result in the liquidation of U.S. air bases in Britain. While rejecting the Soviet-proposed pact, Macmillan held that Britain and Russia should, among other things, resolve differences in keeping with the provisions of the United Nations Charter and that both governments should “agree that disputes should be settled by negotiations and not by force.&quot;</span></p>
