<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WHICH COUNTS MORE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Which counts more, quantity or motive—how much or why? This old world concerns itself mainly with how much. It ever worships at the altar of bigness. The man who gives vast sums to educational institutions, or to charitable, religious or even political organizations is highly praised in the public press. No one thinks of asking why. To encourage giving, religious and charitable groups will publish lists telling how much each donor gave. All such stress on quantity, of course, is to benefit the receivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Fortunately, quantity is not the sole criterion. Because there is such a quality as love, those not rich have a chance, as it were. So it does not at all follow that the young man who gives his espoused an engagement ring costing $1,000 loves her one hundred times as much as the one who gives his a ring worth $10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The same is true regarding the parentchild relation. It has been established that one of the chief causes of juvenile delinquency is lack of mature mother love. Social workers have found that a child can sense whether he is deprived of his mother’s companionship because she is compelled to work to help support him or because she finds ' her duties in the home boring, and he responds accordingly; in his little heart he resents rejection but reconciles himself to her absence when such is truly necessary.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19570308_files/g_E_19570308-3.png" alt="" style="width:103pt;height:110pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">The same principle applies to the Christian and his ministry. The poor widow that Jesus commended was able to give the least of all, but gave out of love, and so all she had, and it counted for most. So also, while “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,” unless we give out of love, we are not profited at all. Our motive counts more than the amount we give.—Luke 21:1-4; Acts 20:35; 1 Cor. 13:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All of which calls to mind the Scriptural admonition, “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart,” and for good reason, for it is “more treacherous than anything else.” It will, unless we are careful, vitiate our serving or giving by letting a selfish motive creep in. So let us make certain that we put the emphasis where it belongs, upon right motive. Having that, quantity will take care of itself. —Prov. 4:23; Jer. 17:9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">“The people just didn’t believe the storm would hit. They had weathered out others less intense. They thought this would be ■ <sup>1</sup> the same. They had more than ample warning. They’re hard-headed. They gambled, and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font14"> of them lost.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Many Unwilling to Heed Warnings</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Does it strike us as strange that so many persons would gamble with their lives? Does it seem incredible that so many persons would jeopardize the lives of their loved ones, the members of their own family ignoring warnings that came from the sources? Inconceivable it .may seem, but as one newspaper said: &quot;What is to be deduced from this [disaster] ? That Weather Bureau warnings are not yet perfect? Or that people don’t listen to warnings anyway? A little of both—especially the latter.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font15">x&gt;r</span></p><img src="g_E_19570308_files/g_E_19570308-8.png" alt="" style="width:295pt;height:182pt;">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">'ip.-'V'.-lli-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">So it is not so strange after all that great numbers of people pay little attention to well-founded warnings. Why was it that only eight humans survived the global flood of Noah’s day? Not because the world of that time did not have a warning. Indeed, God caused Noah to sound the warning; but the warning that that “preacher of righteousness” sounded was ignored by the masses of people. They could have investigated Noah’s warning message. They could have learned that Noah’s warning was based on the sure word of God. They could have learned that Noah was not building a huge ark for the mere enjoyment of construction. But they would not even give serious thought to the warning; they dismissed it as fantastic. So it is that the Son of God tells us concerning the people of Noah’s day: “They took no note until the flood came and swept them all a\Vay.” —2 Pet. 2:5; Matt. 24:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Here we see a tendency, then, a tendency to take no note of warnings if they disturb one’s pattern of living. It is so much easier to ignore the warning and to delude oneself with the thought that it may not be so. Take, for example, the warning Christ Jesus gave Jerusalem: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then understand that the desolating of her has drawn near. Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of her [Jerusalem] withdraw, and let those in the nearby regions not enter into her, because these are days for meting out justice.” Christ even warned what the enemy armies would do: “Your enemies will build around you a fortification with pointed stakes and will encircle you and distress you from every side, and they will dash you and your children [Jerusalem’s citizens] within you to the ground, and they will not leave a stone upon a stone in you.” -Luke 21:20-22; 19:43, 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus gave that warning A.D. 33, Not many years later it happened just as he had foretold, A.D. 66 the Roman president over Syria, Cestius Gallus, led an army against Jerusalem to quell a revolt of the Jews. Gallus was on the verge of taking the city when, suddenly, as the historian Josephus relates, “he retired from the city, without any reason in the world.” This unaccountable withdrawal gave an opportunity for flight, an opportunity to heed Jesus’ warning. This the Christians did. They fled to the mountains. The Jews who had rejected Christ also rejected his warning. They stayed. Just a few years later, A.D. 70, Roman armies again surrounded Jerusalem. Now it was too late to flee. The opportunity to heed Jesus’ warning had passed. The victorious Roman armies put to the sword a reported 1,100,000 persons and took captive 97,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This disregard for warnings was nothing new for the Jews. The whole history of the nation of Israel, in fact, is a long record of failure to listen to and act on warnings. God sent his prophets continually to warn the rulers and the people to turn from their stubborn, idolatrous ways, but they usually refused to heed the warnings. Because the Israelites refused to act on so many warnings, God rejected the nation. (Jer. 29:18, 19) The nation of Israel with its dynasty of kings of the royal line of David came to an end in 607 B.C. God himself caused Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to destroy Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Warnings from God Not</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Joke</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And if we go back to Abraham’s day, we find another classic example of disaster because of not listening to warnings. God had determined to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because of their unspeakable wickedness. Abraham’s nephew Lot lived in Sodom, and for Abraham’s sake God sent his angels to Sodom to warn Lot and send him and his family out of the city before it was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The angels said to Lot: “ ‘Do you have anyone else here? Son-in-law and your sons and your daughters and all who are yours in the city, bring out of the place! For we are destroying this place, because the outcry against them has grown loud before Jehovah, so that Jehovah sent us to destroy the city.* Hence Lot went on out and began to speak to his sons-in-law who had taken his daughters, and he kept on saying: 'Get up! Get out of this place, because Jehovah is destroying the city!’ But in the eyes of his sons-in-law he seemed like a man who was joking.” (Gen. 19:1214) What folly! Even though the warning may have sounded fantastic, the sons-in-law of Lot </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">should have taken note that </span><span class="font14">Lot was intensely serious. Instead of dismissing it as a big joke, they should have inquired into the basis for such a warning. But with the attitude they had, it is doubtful that Lot could have even explained to them the grounds for his warning. They had ears, but they were not listening. They gambled with their lives and lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Some Modern-Day Examples</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We should not think that this long historical record of disasters arising from failure to heed warnings has been of much benefit to people of the twentieth century. It has not. How many examples there are of unwillingness to act on warnings! Familiar to almost everyone is the fate of the steamship Titanic. On April 14, 1912, this supposedly unsinkable ship was on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. It struck an iceberg and 1,502 men, women and children perished. Yet the Titanic had been warned. The ship’s </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">wireless </span><span class="font14">operator had received six warnings about icebergs. One warning even gave the exact location of the very iceberg the Titanic struck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When warnings seem too improbable, the danger is that they may be dismissed without even an examination of the grounds upon which they </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">are based. Many </span><span class="font14">are such examples during World War II. America's Pearl Harbor disaster did not happen without a warning. On December 7, 1941, an army private, operating a listening device at Pearl Harbor, reported approaching planes. His warning was ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Battle of the Bulge cost the Allies heavy casualties. The German attack on December 16, 1944, completely surprised the Allies. Yet warning had been given. A number ■ of captured German soldiers gave definite assurance a German attack was imminent. Since the Allies generally believed Germany was incapable of a serious </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">counteroffensive, the reports</span><span class="font14"> of German prisoners were considered too improbable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Oddly enough, the more detailed a warning is, the greater is the tendency to cast it aside as fantastic. One of Hitler's secret service chiefs tells in his memoirs, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Labyrinth,</span><span class="font14"> how the Russians were informed of the exact date of the German invasion; yet they did not heed the warning. This same writer tells how a report of the true figures on American steel production was presented to Goring and Hitler as an urgent warning. Both Nazi leaders rejected the high figures of the report as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">utterly fantastic, sheer nonsense. “Later, </span><span class="font14">at the Nuremberg Trials,” said the writer, &quot;I occupied a cell across the hall from Goering’s. . . . Speaking from his cell in a loud voice he said to me, ‘Well, it has certainly turned out that you were not talking nonsense after all.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">It is almost comical the way precise </span><span class="font14">warnings are ignored. Writing about the German officials and army officers who were anti-Nazi, Constantine FitzGibbon said in 20 </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">July</span><span class="font14"> that they sent a representa-five to London “with the mission-—which he accomplished—of informing Winston Churchill and Lord Lloyd of Hitler’s plans to invade Poland. [One anti-Nazi] was so certain that Nazi Germany must not be allowed to win the war that he deliberately revealed the plan for the occupation of Norway to the Norwegian government. He told the Dutch military attache, Major Sas, of the proposed operations in the West, giving the exact date on which Holland and Belgium would be invaded. So complete was the information that the Dutch intelligence service—and apparently the British one too—decided that it must be a plant: at least no action was taken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Benefiting by Others’ Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">No action taken—what a calamitous course when a warning is well founded! Now that we know what the human tendency is regarding warnings, how can we benefit? By not considering every warning a joke, by not dismissing a warning just because it seems too improbable and by not being unwilling to investigate the grounds for a warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Disaster, then, can easily be avoided. When faced with a warning, a person ought to ask himself certain questions: What are the grounds for the warning? How reliable are these grounds? Has this foundation upon which the warning rests proved reliable in the past? What are the consequences to me if I reject the warning without even looking into it, and it proves true?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We can benefit by others’ experiences right now by acting on the warning that Christ Jesus gave. Remember how accurate was his warning to the people of Jerusalem. Christ warns us that when God’s kingdom puts an end to this evil world, most of earth's population will be destroyed because of not heeding the warning, just as it happened in Noah’s day. Warned Jesus: “Just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. For as people were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”—Matt. 24:37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In this same chapter of Matthew we read how Jesus answered his disciples’ question as to what would be the warning sign of his “presence and of the consummation of the system of things.” Jesus explained that there would be many woes, a flood of woes that would come upon a single generation. Among these many woes that would make up the warning sign of the “last days,&quot; Jesus mentioned world wars, “food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.” He said there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”—Matt. 24: 3, 7; Luke 21: 25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One feature of the warning sign, Jesus showed, would be, not a woe, but good news: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” Thus Jesus showed that the good news of his kingdom, established in heaven, would be proclaimed by witnesses throughout the earth. When the warning witness has been completed, Jesus explained, this evil world will come to its end with “great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.”—Matt. 24:14, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The great tribulation that brings this evil world to its end, making way for a righteous new world, is called elsewhere In the Bible “the war of the great day of God the Almighty” and the battle of “Har-Magedon” or Armageddon, One of Christ’s apostles called it “the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment,” Another called it “the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men,”—-Rev. 16:14, 16; Rom. 2:5; 2 Pet. 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How would people respond to the warning of Armageddon ? How would they react when it was pointed out that the great sign of the “last days” is visibly evident? Jesus said that most people at the time for the world’s end would act just like the people in Noah’s day; they would take no note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Soon now, during this generation, God’s kingdom will come against this world. Leading heavenly armies, Christ the King will smite the nations “with a rod of iron” and bring ‘ ‘due punishment upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus. These very ones will pay the penalty of everlasting destruction from before the Lord and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font14"> the glory of his strength.” Because God “does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance,” he has declared in his Word that a warning would be sounded. This is a warning that is really good news. It means that a righteous new world is at hand.—Rev. 19:15; 2 Thess. 1:8, 9; 2 Pet. 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reliable Basis for Armageddon Warning</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Despite the warning given this world, Armageddon comes “exactly as a thief in the night.” This is because most people refuse to consider the warning seriously. Many will even ridicule it. Why? “According to their wish, this fact escapes their notice, that there were heavens in ancient times and an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water by the word of God, and by those means the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water.&quot; The ridi-culers, then, refuse to consider what happened to the world that Noah warned. They refuse to recognize that this present world is under a similar judgment of destruction and that it will come certainly, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">inexorably, </span><span class="font14">with no possibility of failure. For “by the same word” (the same word of God by which the preflood world was destroyed), says Christ’s apostle, “the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men.”—1 Thess. 5:2; 2 Pet. 3:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Benefit by the warning now being sounded world-wide by Jehovah’s witnesses. They invite people everywhere to turn to the Bible, to prove for themselves that the warning of Armageddon is no joke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Benefit by the many examples of persons who met disaster because of not even investigating a warning. Do not be like the people who would not heed the hurricane warning and move to higher ground. Remember what the head of the New Orleans weather bureau said of the Louisiana disaster: “We can only warn people of the storms. We can’t take them by the hand and force them to safety.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah’s witnesses cannot take people by the hand and force them to safety, so they can survive Armageddon into God’s new world. No, but Jehovah’s witnesses are extending their hands helpfully. They want to aid people to learn of God’s kingdom, to take the course that leads to everlasting life on earth under that kingdom, to avoid the destruction that the kingdom will soon bring upon this evil world. Remember the warning example Jesus set before us: “They took no note until the flood came and swept them all away.”</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font26"><a name="bookmark8"></a>X </span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">New Pope &amp;&nbsp;Crowned</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!&quot; correspondent in Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">RICH medieval pageantry the 262nd pope of the Roman Catholic Church was crowned on November 4, 1958. Church officials, representatives of the ancient orders, dignitaries, special guests and invited diplomats witnessed the four-and-a-half-hour ceremony from positions within St. Peter’s basilica. For the benefit of the many people who could not get in, the proceedings were televised. The ceremonies were the climax of several weeks of excitement in the Catholic world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The excitement began with the death of Pope Pius XII on October 9, 1958. His death was not unexpected. He had suffered a stroke three days before. A second stroke came on the eighth of October from which he never regained consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The stir created by the pope’s death and the elaborate funeral that followed gave way to speculation about who his successor would be. Rumors and counterrumors from</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">so-called “inside sources” flew about wildly. The choice of a new pope rested upon the shoulders of the College of Cardinals. It seemed certain that the Italian cardinals would not support a non-Italian. But there was no clear-cut favorite, as was the case in 1939 when Eugenio Pacelli was elected on the first ballot.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19570308_files/g_E_19570308-9.png" alt="" style="width:276pt;height:205pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">After each ballot the cardinals used smoke signals to indicate the results. This was done by a stove that was especially installed for the purpose. Black smoke indicated a failure to agree. White smoke signaled an agreement. Every time a puff of smoke came out of the slender chimney, excited voices from the crowd outside could be heard exclaiming that this was it. But when the smoke darkened a disappointed murmur would run through the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After several days and eleven ballots the cardinals finally signaled that a pope had been elected. He proved to be Cardinal</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Roncalli of Venice. He was elected by the necessary two thirds plus one vote. The traditional announcement, “Habemus pa-pam” (“We have a pope’’), was made to the crowds from the balcony of St. Peter’s basilica. Shortly after his election the portly figure of the former cardinal appeared on the papal balcony to give the traditional </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Urbi et Orbi</span><span class="font14"> (To the city and to the world) blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Coronation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A pope’s coronation is customarily set for a Sunday, but the new pope selected Tuesday, November 4, as the day. This may have been done because November 4 is a national holiday in Italy and permitted more people to attend the ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The day dawned cloudy and cool. The sprawling city of Rome was hardly astir before the elaborate functions within the basilica were under way. The immense square in front of the basilica gradually filled with a crowd of mixed people from various countries and walks of life. They seemed to lack the enthusiasm that a person would expect to find on such an occasion. A description of the ceremony was brought to them by means of a publicaddress system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Finally at about 12:30 p.m. the doors were opened by brilliantly clad Swiss guardsmen. Richly robed church dignitaries, chaplains, patriarchs and others filed out to await the pope’s appearance on the papal balcony. Expectation was kindled in the crowd when red-robed cardinals began appearing on the balconies that flanked the papal balcony. Finally the door to this balcony was opened wide and Pope John XXIII stepped out for the final part of his coronation ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A cardinal proceeded to pronounce the ancient Latin formula: “Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art the father of princes and of kings, Pontiff of the whole world, and vicar on this earth of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, to whom is honor and glory, world without end.” At this point the triple diadem was placed on the head of Angelo Roncalli. Cries of “Vwa if papa?” rose from the crowd. After he pronounced the papal blessing to the multitudes the ceremony was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Inside St. Peter's Basilica</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It was now possible for anyone who wished to enter the church. As I stepped through the door I was struck by the dazzling splendor of the interior. Here, indeed, were the riches of an empire. When I came to the famous black statue that the Catholic Church claims to be the image of Peter, I stopped in amazement The statue was dressed in crimson and gold robes as if it were a living pope. On its head rested a resplendently jeweled triple crown. On its breast was an ornate shield from which hung a jewel-studded cross. On a finger of the right hand was the papal ring of blessing. Lined up in front of it were devout Catholics patiently waiting their turn either to kiss reverently the statue’s right foot or to touch their hand to their lips and then caress the foot. The foot was noticeably worn by the multitudes who have given it this adoration in years past. I </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">marveled that such image worship should </span><span class="font14">take place in a church that claims to be Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I thought of what the apostle Peter said to the Christians of his day who were formerly pagans: “For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of loose conduct . , . and idolatries that are without legal restraint.”—1 Pet. 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Papal Changes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The newly elected pope did not hesitate to use his papal authority to institute changes. He renewed a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">tradition that the </span><span class="font14">previous pope had broken by bestowing the red hat of the office of cardinal on the secretary of the conclave. In a matter of a few weeks twenty-three new cardinals were nominated. This broke the four-hundred-year-old tradition of not having more than seventy </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">members in the Sacred </span><span class="font14">College of Cardinals. Thirteen of the new cardinals are Italians. That brought the total of Italian cardinals to twenty-nine. This seems to reverse the trend begun by the late Pius XII toward internationalizing the college by making many appointments of non-Italians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another change was the appointment of a new Secretary of State for the Vatican. This office had been left vacant because the previous pope had exercised the duties of the office himself. Still another change was the resuming of audiences with the Roman Curia. These had not been held for five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some periodicals, such as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">II Punto,</span><span class="font14"> see an improvement of relations between the Vatican and the East. This may be due to Roncalli’s adeptness at diplomacy as well as the tolerance he has shown toward the socialists. &quot;All these different elements,” the periodical stated, “permit us to foresee that the election of John XXIII means a liquidation of Pacellianism, not only in the removal of the men of the late Pope’s Court, but principally in the creation of a new atmosphere in the ranks of the supreme authorities of the Church. This does not at all mean that the Catholic Church wifi approach the Communist regimes, but it simply means that in the Sacred College, or among the supreme authorities of the Vatican, there exist the prospects of policies that are more dynamic and, above all, more realistic even toward the eastern countries and particularly toward the socialist forces in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Angelo Roncalli has been noted for his ability not to offend the leftist tendencies of the socialists. If recent events can be used as a criterion, Roncalli’s rule may bring forth some liberal tendencies. An indication of this has already appeared in that no new cardinals were nominated to Eastern bloc countries that had been irritated by appointments made by Pius XII.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">A Great Difference</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is a great difference between the previous pope and the new one. Eugenio Pacelli came from an aristocratic Roman family, whereas Angelo Roncalli is from a poor peasant family, Pacelli was always quick to underline, both by actions and statements, that he belonged to the nobility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Pacellian regime could be said to have begun at the time Pacelli was Secretary of State for the Vatican. His private “court” of relatives, friends and friends of his relatives, as well as German Jesuits, gradually gained in power over the cardinals and other ecclesiastical authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A decided German influence on Pacelli was evident from his views while pope as well as the fact that the language of his papal court was German. This may have been due to his long association with Germany as the Apostolic Nuncio to that country. It was during that time that he negotiated a concordat between the Vatican and Adolf Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pius XII lived and worked in an isolation particularly restricted and was surrounded by an intimate group of persons who exercised a strict control on what matters reached his hands. Even cardinals had to submit their petitions to the pope in writing. Only after the written petitions had been approved by Pacelli’s court did they reach him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While Pius XII surrounded himself with a powerful court, John XXIII appears to be returning to the cardinals their traditional role in papal affairs. This is indicated by his re-establishing the authority of the Roman Curia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font14"> of November 23, 1958, stated that John XXIII had “served notice upon all that he intended to grasp firmly the reins of the Vatican administration, which Pius XII had allowed to slip out of his hands.” This paper also said: “Some Vatican officials think they are paying Pius XII a compliment when they say in unguarded moments that, in his almost twenty years as Pope, he never made anyone laugh and never reit me sngniest urge or desire to do so.” This is a contrast to the present pope, who caused the Clementine </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Hall in the Vatican to</span><span class="font14"> resound with laughter during a speech he gave to five hundred newspaper representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Secrecy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To millions of persons, Catholics included, the papacy is a mysterious entity beclouded with secrecy. The inner goings on, the behind-the-scenes maneuvering, are little publicized. All information from the Vatican comes through its press office. This is not always reliable. Remarking about this fact, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font14"> magazine of October 20,1958, said: “The press office of the Vatican, the only official source of the world’s news of the Papacy, could perhaps be forgiven'its inefficiency but not its corruption. Here underlings release, invent and sell ‘news’ with callous and candid calculation and abandon. The dishonor and the scandal that they invite are scarcely more remarkable than the looseness of organization that has permitted such a condition to exist without their superiors being aware of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Great secrecy surrounded the process of electing the new pope. Corridors to the room where the conclave was held were walled up. Doors and windows were locked and a special seal attached to them. The car</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">dinals</span><span class="font14"> lived and met in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">confinement</span><span class="font14"> until they had selected the new pope. After his election they knelt before him one by one and kissed his feet and hands and embraced him from right and then from left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Only One Leader</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With the enthronement of a new pope in regal splendor the Catholic world rejoiced. But when a person considers the pomp and pageantry that was associated with the pope’s coronation as well as the adornment shown mm, n, is uimcuii to see how it is a Christian proceeding. Nothing similar to it existed among Christ's apostles. Rather than resembling something that would take place among the Christians, it resembled more closely what would have been found in the pagan palaces and temples of ancient Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">First-century Christians did not choose one of their members and exalt him, crown him and do obeisance to him. They worshiped Jehovah </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">God and did obeisance to </span><span class="font14">the one He designated as their Leader, and that was Christ. After he left, the apostles did not elect a new leader. Neither did they consider any one of them to be the vicar of Christ. Christ continued to be their Leader. He led them by means of holy spirit. He was the One they exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is no Scriptural authorization for any professing Christian to assume a position like that of a worldly king and to be hailed as “the father of princes and of kings, Pontiff of the whole world, and vicar on this earth of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.” When Christ was on earth he rejected the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">position of a worldly king of kings.</span><span class="font14"> How can any professed Christian accept what he rejected?—Matt. 4:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since Christ said his “kingdom is no part of this world,” how can the pope consider himself to be the vicar or substitute for Christ with authority over worldly princes and kings? (John 18:36) There is no Scriptural authorization for such an exalted claim. The Bible tersely states: “Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” (Jas. 4:4) It is to Christ that Christians must do obeisance and not to any man. It is He whom they must exalt and honor, thus glorifying his God and Father, for Christ, and no man, has received the divine appointment as King. —Phil. 2:9-11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">the worries and boredom of daily living. In Taiwan, the Chinese opera enjoys a unique position in this regard. Rich in pageantry and . artistic representation, it leaves an impression not to be easily forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To the average Westerner this type of opera may appear as anything but an opera. Usually it is performed on a curtainless stage, almost void of furnishings, and is more often seen on an improvised bamboo stage in an open market or a vacant lot than in an auditorium. Unlike Western operas, stage settings are totally unnecessary for the Chinese opera. Instead, an intricate set of stage conventions is used to convey the ideas to the minds of the audience. Thus, the same drab stage may portray a street scene, a battlefield and a king's palace without any changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The singing is for the most part actually speaking that is done in high-pitched falsetto voices, molded by many years of rigid training in order to measure up to the strict standards of the opera critics. The orchestra, made up of a half-dozen musi-■Ml cians, is seated to one side of the stage. They play almost continuously and may become nerve-racking at times, because, according to ancient theatrical custom, the opera music must be noisy to attract public attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Stage Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">. The part may open with a principal character simply walking to the front of the stage and announcing: “I, so-and-so, am a famous general . . .in this way giving his background and telling what is to take place in the play. Whether or not the audience grasps what is going on depends largely on the individual performer. He must not only remember the hundreds of rules governing the stage conventions but also be able to carry them out skillfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For example, since there are no doors or windows on the stage, a harassed young maidservant simply brings her hands together at arm’s length to denote the closing of a door to keep out her overly affectionate young master, while, on the other hand, the door may be opened by bringing the hands apart. Two men may walk about the same lighted stage searching for each other. However, because they have their hands outstretched, the audience knows they are in darkness, groping about Tears are not necessary to show sorrow; rather, merely raising the sleeve in a gesture of wiping the eyes is sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If an actor is supposed to be riding on horseback he just walks on stage carrying a stick decorated with a tassel, which represents his having a whip. If he throws the stick down on the stage, that is the sign of dismounting. If, on the other hand, he should be riding in a carriage, he walks between two yellow flags. The few strokes of a paddle, as if in water, indicates he is seaborne. Actual eating or drinking is never done on the Chinese operatic stage. Drinking is indicated by holding an empty cup to the lips and at the same time shielding it with the right sleeve. An empty bowl and chopsticks are used to show eating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When it comes to the displaying of emotions, It is very important that one have some understanding of the symbolisms. In love scenes, for example, there is never any embracing or kissing no matter how madly in love the couple may be. Instead, love is indicated only by vaguely touching each other’s hands, which are extended in the long sleeves. According to ancient Chinese tradition, the man and woman are always separated by a distance, even man and wife acting with cool politeness as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">though</span><span class="font14"> barely acquainted. The man may fluff his beard or violently shake his head to display anger, while he just wrinkles his brow if he is worried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All action, too, is symbolic rather than actual. A fight between two persons looks more like an acrobatic contest, tor, instead of actually fighting, the opponents roll on the stage, leap into the air and go through all sorts of stunts. The faster and more strenuous the action, the greater the fight is supposed to be. Instead of chasing his foe, the winner stays behind to execute a few more difficult feats to win applause, while the loser usually turns a somersault in mid-air to concede defeat. Or if he is supposed to be killed, he falls to the stage, then gets up and hurries away. A busy housewife may thread an unseen needle with invisible thread and proceed to do mending, while a country lass scatters imaginary com to feed her imaginary chickens and ducks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Colorful Costumes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It does not matter whether the character portrayed is rich or poor; he is invariably clothed in silk. Even the lowly beggar is no exception. Colors are important in distinguishing the various roles portrayed. Bright colors, for instance, identify a handsome young man, while a monarch will always wear yellow. Scarlet is the color for important officials, with a greater degree of fancy needlework identifying those of a higher rank. Servants and peddlers must content themselves with jackets, since the robes are reserved for the upper classes. Generally speaking, the costumes bespeak the eighteenth-century dress of the Chinese people and are seldom matched elsewhere for their elaborate design and rich colors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Usually the actors and actresses do all of their own facial makeup. They must know </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font14"> heart how to create accurately with a few paints and brushes all the many patterns of characters needed to thrill the opera lovers. Just one mistake would be a humiliating giveaway, and could do irreparable damage to the actor’s career. This face-painting is an outstanding </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">feature of the Chinese</span><span class="font14"> opera, which, along with the gorgeous costumes, more than overcomes the drab deficiency of the stage itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">In many instances the role of the leading lady is played by a man, which is also according to ancient custom. After the ordeal of eyebrow trimming, rouge, paints and lipstick, he wriggles on stage, every inch a lovely woman in the eyes of the audience. Of course, a few adjustments must first be made to add feminine charm to the plain masculine face. A slice of false hair may be stitched close in front of the ear on either side to narrow the face, while a bit of length may be added by pasting over the forehead a strip of white cloth extending to the desired length above the hairline. This is then lavished with thick paints to conceal the cloth and in this way create the long face needed to picture noble charm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Plots for the Chinese opera may be based on actual happenings in Chinese-history or upon fiction. Regardless of which, they are usually filled with Chinese wit and humor, ending on a high moral note with the villain receiving due punishment, even though it may put quite a strain on the imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Despite its many peculiarities and whether it is entertaining to Westerners or not, its pageantry and imaginary acting is loved by the majority of the Chinese people scattered around the globe. To the millions of displaced Chinese in the Orient, the Chinese opera is something they look upon as being their very own, symbolizing their national ways and culture. Still others view it as having educational value, for, regardless of whether one enjoys this type of entertainment or not, it must be admitted that it is not conducive to lazy minds, since every scene must be so carefully scrutinized in order to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some wonder if the influx of new ideas from the West due to</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">increased military and technical co-operation may not well cause the opera to fade from the picture of Chinese entertainment. That seems unlikely, at least for the present. As Chinese as Peiping roast duck, the Chinese opera is, most observers feel, just too Chinese to be easily dispensed with.</span></p>

Voskuyl says: “In spite of the enormous amount of water on the globe, there is the right proportion of land surface to water surface. If there were any greater or less amount, the rainfall would be greatly affected. What determines this exact ratio between land and water? The ocean floors are constructed with huge basins which contain a volume no less than thirteen times the bulk of the land which rises above them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Furthermore, they are so exactly filled that if the amount of water were </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font13">increased by a small fraction, the land would be overflowed.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">FROZEN WORLD</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font24">S</span><span class="font14">NOW falls in nearly every part of the world, but since it seldom reaches the ground, vast numbers of people have never seen it. The high-flying clouds may be cold enough to produce snow, but warm air beneath can easily change it to rain before it lands on the earth. As a matter of fact, snow is found only on limited parts of the globe. The polar regions are noted for it, although it may surprise you to know that comparatively little snow fails there because there is so little moisture in the cold air. But when it falls, it may stay a long while. Snow is rare in South America, and in Africa you will probably have to go to the mountains to see it. Apart from mountaintops and the polar areas, snow is particularly found in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Winter has a beauty all its own, but while it lays out its mantle of white it may bring to an aggravating standstill the transportation of a large city. It supplies much-needed moisture for the farmer, but it may also isolate him for weeks at </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font14"> time. And while winter sports are lots of fun, bruises and breaks from falls on ice can be very painful. So in addition to those who enjoy it, there are bound to be a good many that would prefer to go somewhere else when it comes. When cold winds and snow whip across the land, amazing protection is provided for living things. Just as the milk left on your doorstep on a cold day may freeze and push off the cap as it expands, so the water in ponds expands and floats as it freezes, instead of sinking and possibly </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">destroying the living </span><span class="font14">things beneath it. Thus a protective layer is formed. The snow, too, lays down a</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">warm blanket of insulation for the earth and the living things it contains. Animals can burrow into this natural blanket and keep warm. Eskimos find, that the snow around their igloos provides such fine insulation that their own body heat may suffice to keep the room warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Frozen Beauty</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When there is a quiet snowfall the landscape is changed into a glistening sea. Damp snow clings to wires and trees, transforming them into snow-canopied marvels of architecture, and the roofs of houses take on new and delightful contours. As the moon rises and trees throw their shadows across the fields, a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">picture </span><span class="font14">of frozen beauty appears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The snow takes shape in the clouds when the air is cold enough. Free molecules of moisture join to form tiny ice crystals, and as these are buffeted about in the cloud they change size and shape, combining with other crystals to form snowflakes, perhaps adding branches or rays, until they become heavy enough to begin their descent to the earth. The form they take depends in great measure on the amount of vapor present in the atmosphere and on the temperature of the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">From one storm to another there may be considerable variation in the snow. On a cool, crisp day the snow crystals will probably be dry and fluffy. On another day the clouds may be low and the air mild and humid. With these circumstances the snow is more likely to be damp and the flakes will cling together. Very light dry snow may weigh no more than 150 pounds to a cubic yard. But when snow of the very damp variety has had time to settle down, it may weigh as much as 1,500 pounds to a cubic yard. If you had not noticed the difference before, your aching back will tell you after you have shoveled it from your sidewalk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A newly fallen blanket of snow is a peaceful sight, but, quite unseen to a casual observer, it is alive with activity. Every snow crystal is changing form. Melting and evaporation take place. From above, the weight of the surface snow will crush the delicate formations that characterized the free flakes and pack them down, and water molecules proceed to transfer from one snow crystal to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another of the frozen wonders may be seen even before the snow begins to fall, and on cold winter days it may move right into your home. It is the frost. It is closely related to dew, which forms on roofs and vegetation near the ground when the temperature of the air falls to the point that the air can no longer hold its load of moisture. If the atmosphere is loaded with moisture when the temperature falls below the freezing point, then frost will form. It is not dew that has frozen. Rather, the water vapor in the air changes directly into crystals of frost. Perhaps some of the most striking illustrations of this frozen beauty are seen on the inside of windowpanes. When the air indoors is moist and the weather is cold enough to chill the windowpane below the freezing point, the frost will appear in beautiful artistic displays on the inside of the glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Destructive Avalanches</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When the snowbanks of winter pile high on mountain slopes, it means danger for those living in the valleys below. People in the Swiss Alps know that they can expect avalanches, and year after year they see them come down the same paths. To avert danger, stone dikes are erected and buildings are located out of the danger zone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After a heavy snowfall little encouragement is needed to send an avalanche plunging to the valley below. Rocks that could have provided barriers may have become crusted over with the snow that fell early in the season, so now the snow has an open runway when the slide begins. As it gains momentum, it rips out trees and picks up huge boulders to add to its load. While snow at the bottom and on the sides of the slide is slowed by friction, the main load may pick up speed until it hurtles down at seventy-five miles an hour. Often more deadly than the snow itself is the blast of air that it pushes ahead of it. And along both sides of the path of the avalanche everything within reach is sucked to destruction by the vacuum that follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In a series of avalanches in the Alps in 1951 it was reported that the wind pushed ahead of the descending snow actually snapped off grown trees and picked up homes that were not even reached by the snow and hurled them hundreds of yards before dashing them to the ground. In one case the air pressure ripped the roof from a house, lifted out a bed on which a child was sleeping, and deposited the bed with its occupant safely in a snowbank while it smashed the house to splinters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Often avalanches come with such lightning speed that victims are trapped in a grave of snow. If the snow is light, they may have air to breathe for hours while rescue attempts are being made, provided they do not struggle. However, violent breathing may cause them to inhale so much of the powdery snow that they drown. A victim trapped beneath wet snow is smothered almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Majestic Glaciers</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not everywhere does the snow escape in an avalanche, nor </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">is there always enough </span><span class="font14">warm weather to melt it all, so snowfields and glaciers form. As pressure of the snow and ice causes melting below, the mass slowly moves. Some of these vast fields of ice follow regular channels in their descent to the sea, and on the way they are joined by tributaries in a slow-motion imitation of rivers. While the surface ice is brittle and may break, forming yawning and dangerous crevasses, the lower part is plastic, so that the entire glacier does not move at the same rate. The center part, with less friction, moves more rapidly than the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Kate Field, in her description of the majestic beauty of Muir Glacier in Alaska, said: “No pen can do justice to the grandeur of a glacier like the Muir, as all become spellbound at its majestic and irresistible force and indescribable beauty: ‘I</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">magin</span><span class="font14">e Niagara Falls frozen a solid wall of ice 3,000 feet high moving toward the ocean at the rate of SO feet a day, and a similar wall 600 or 700 feet under water, and the whole mass cracking and giving forth peals of thunder . . . thousands of tons of lovely blue ice . . . and you will have some slight conception of this imposing spectacle.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Knick Glacier, near Anchorage, Alaska, annually plays its role in the operation of an amazing self-dumping lake. Each year when it gets warm, Lake George spills over Knick Glacier and eats through the dam of ice to release a flood of about a hundred million gallons of water a day. It does not last long. Soon the glacial dam begins to close and the lake again forms behind it, awaiting the next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Glaciers that reach down to the sea break off to form icebergs. Some of these appear as towering mountains of ice jutting out of the sea, but five or six times as much ice may be below the water. Others appear to be vast plains of ice that move </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">about in the</span><span class="font14"> water, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">it is an</span><span class="font14"> aweinspiring spectacle to see them break off a glacier and plunge into the sea, but they can be a real peril to navigation, and in 1912, after the tragic sinking of the Titanic, the International Ice Patrol was founded to watch for icebergs along shipping lanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Polar Regions</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Far to'the north lies the Arctic, a place that has long excited the imagination of explorers. Although it is generally thought to be a vast perpetually frozen land, that is not an accurate picture of it. In the first place, much of the Arctic is not land. And, secondly, it is not all perpetually frozen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times Magazine</span><span class="font14"> of October 19, 1958, in speaking of the Arctic, said: “Although the idea that a solid ice sheet covers the central Arctic has lingered stubbornly in the popular fancy, the northern cap of ice worn by our planet is actually a thin crust—on the whole, only about seven feet thick—over an ocean two miles deep in places.” This ice is constantly being broken up and shifted. As the ice is carried along by the ocean currents, it flows south between Norway and Greenland. “The only major land-bome ice sheet in the north covers Greenland,” the article said. “There are scattered smaller ice caps in the Arctic, but most of Siberia, Alaska and northern Canada is ice-free.” The North Pole is definitely not the coldest spot on earth; In fact, it is not really much colder than it has been in North Dakota in the United States. Ocean currents do much to moderate the temperature, and summer temperatures in the Arctic often rise to the eighties. “Except in the mountainous interior of Greenland,&quot; reports Ritchie Calder, “nine-tenths of all Arctic land is snow-free in August.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Greenland itself, however, is largely covered by a mammoth ice sheet that buries mountains and valleys alike under thousands of feet of snow and ice. It seems to take the form of two large domes that are centers from which the ice works its way down to the coasts. Paul-Emile Victor did an interesting job of describing it when he said that if the Greenland ice sheet were cut up into oversized ice cubes, it could furnish a two-ton portion for every man, woman and child on earth every minute for a year before going out of business. Or, he estimated, it could be used to encase the entire globe in a seventeen-foot-thick ice case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There are a variety of viewpoints as to what constitutes the Arctic, but the Arctic Circle that appears on a globe is the point where one enters the land of the midnight sun. This line, 23° and 30' below the North Pole, corresponds to the extent of the inclination of the earth on its axis from a vertical position. Due to the inclination of the earth on its axis and the fact that its axis is always pointed in the same direction while the earth revolves around the sun, we have variation in the seasons. When the Arctic end of the earth is inclined toward the sun, daylight continues at the North Pole for six months, while the Antarctic has a six-month period of night. Then for six months the situation is reversed. As distance from the poles increases, the length of duration of this phenomenon decreases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Six months of night may not appeal to you, but to many in the Arctic it has a beauty all its own. The book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Men Against the Frozen North</span><span class="font14"> says: “We think of night in terms of perpetual darkness. Consider however the sky-glow of the Arctic night, the starlight, the moonlight and the Northern Lights, all enhanced by the white mirror of the snow. ‘Night’ in such conditions is no longer synonymous with darkness. Travel becomes possible, and for the Eskimo the crisp winter snow is ideal for building his quick, overnight shelter, the igloo. Of course, there are the winter hazards of snow-storms and blizzards but, on the whole, Arctic weather is more predictable and less haphazard than a typical British summer.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the other hand, the Antarctic presents a more frigid picture. During the International Geophysical Year sixteen parties from eight different nations invaded the Antarctic. Although there are vast areas of frozen water, such as the Ross Sea, the Antarctic concentration of snow and ice is piled up on a mountainous continent that is nearly as large as South America. The French expedition reported ice up to 10,000 feet thick. Generously it shares its ice with the seas around it, where icebergs up to four times the size of Manhattan island break off and go to sea. The book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonder of Snow</span><span class="font14"> describes the Antarctic as &quot;a land of cold summers, fantastically cold winters, violent winds and snowstorms.” The more moderate ways of the Arctic do not seem to have influenced its South Pole counterpart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While you may not choose the polar regions for your home, the frozen world is a fascinating one. The delicate snowflakes, the artistic displays of frost, the tremendous force of an avalanche and the majestic beauty of a glacier, fill God-fearing persons with awe at the wisdom displayed in the creative works of God.—Ps. 104:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">ALMOST everyone, from time to time, takes notes. It may be notes on a lecture; it may I be notes on what one reads. Whatever the source for the notes, the one who takes them wants to gain as much benefit as possible from making them. Just as with other things in life, there is an art to taking notes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;1 We can learn much of the art of note taking by profiting from the experiences of others, thereby avoiding their mistakes. In taking notes on a lecture, there are some mistakes that are often made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;1 First, the one who wants to benefit from the lecture may not come prepared. He may not bring with him pencil or notebook. During the lecture he may suddenly decide to make notes on important. points, only to find a scrap or two of paper. The notes that are made may be only key words and not complete thoughts. Later he may not be able to understand his cryptic notes. He has required too much of his memory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">C In this regard Professor John Genung writes in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Practical Elements of Rhetoric;</span><span class="font13"> “Notes too often fail of permanent value through being too carelessly and indefinitely taken; when they are mere catch-words and fleeting hints they soon fail to call up the associations and connexions that gave them their first usefulness. Even hastily taken notes should . . . express complete thoughts, sufficient to be understood at any time afterward, without need of help from remembered associations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;L Secondly, the person who wants to benefit from a lecture by taking notes may defeat his purpose by taking too many. He may try to copy down virtually every thought of the speaker, perhaps using shorthand to make this possible. During the speech the copyist is so engrossed in the process of dictation that he may learn exceedingly little from the lecture. Later, when asked about the talk, the copyist may have difficulty explaining even the main points. This kind of note taker usually has little in his mind and almost everything on paper. Too much time now must be spent to read and study the notes. This process is much like starting from scratch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">C. So the successful note taker does not try to get everything down on paper. He makes moderate notes. His rule is: Neither too much nor too little. He uses selectivity and evaluation. He makes notes on only the most important points. He waits until the point is clear in his mind before putting it down. Then he uses his own words as much as is possible. By channeling these key ideas through his own mind and vocabulary, the note taker makes these ideas his very own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">C Perhaps the most popular way of making notes on written material is by the dual process of underlining and making marginal comments. Underliners often make the mistake of underlining too much material. Then the key points do not stand out. Rather, underline topic sentences, key words, significant phrases and summary sentences. Marginal notes are usually brief significant facts, key summaries or just an explanatory remark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;L To get the most benefit from notes, refer to them while the subject is still fairly fresh in your mind. Valuable notes may be filed for future reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;L It is commonly believed that the main value of note taking is that they are available for future use. However, many authorities believe that just the process of note taking is of prime importance. Why? Because it causes the person to listen intently, to concentrate on the speaker’s key ideas. The very process is said to intensify one’s ability to concentrate and understand. “It is the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">making</span><span class="font13"> of them,” says Professor Genung, “that is of special value, even more than the possession of them when made.” &lt;L If there is to be great value in the process of making them or in the possession of them, remember the rule: Neither too much nor too little.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in modern times came to a close. Over 250,000 persons had been present on that final afternoon to hear the president of the Watch Tower Society speak on the subject “God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?” With the assembly alive in their minds, the conventioners began their trip back to the 123 lands from which they had come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Ahead of them had gone news of the event. International news services, newsreels and magazines had taken note of the assembly and carried their reports on it to almost every part of the globe. So when the convention delegates arrived home, in many cases they found their neighbors anxious for more news. And when they learned that soon Divine Will assemblies were to be held right in their own country, thousands of them were ready to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It was just eighteen days after the sessions closed at the assembly in New York that the first “echo&quot; assembly was under way. It began on August 21 in Finland. In a few days there was another one on Okinawa, then in Denmark, Austria, Germany, Japan and Switzerland before the end of the month. In September the assembly series gathered greater momentum as it reached out to Africa, Central and South America and Asia. By the end of November eighty Divine Will assemblies had convened, with a total attendance of 548,133 worldwide to enjoy the spiritual feast that was first presented in New York city at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Of course, it presented Quite a task in many places to provide enough rooming accommodations to care for all the conventioners. But the brothers living in the assembly cities were glad to spend</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">whatever time was necessary in going to the homes of the people to arrange for sleeping accommodations. In the Netherlands the people proved to be outstandingly hospitable, providing 40 percent of the accommodations free of charge. In India the problem is somewhat lessened by the fact that many of the brothers bring their own bed rolls with them to assemblies, and in Korea they slept on the straw mats they sat on during the day. While they brought their beds with them, it was still necessary to find rooms in which they could spread them out and go to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Determination to Attend</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The obvious sincerity and zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses are often commented on by others. As to the assembly in Luxembourg a government official made the observation: “Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones who really mean it.” They do mean it. With all their heart they believe the promises of God and they point to God’s kingdom as the only hope for humankind. Their earnestness was evident in the effort they put forth to be present at the Divine Will assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the communist zone in eastern Germany tried to keep Jehovah's witnesses from attending the assembly scheduled for West Berlin September 11-14. When news of the assembly first reached the police they hunted down the brothers in their homes and warned them not to try to attend. They confiscated their personal identification cards, so necessary for travel, and listed their names with the railroads as persons who were not to be given passage. One young man who intended to symbolize his dedication by being baptized at the assembly was already en route to Berlin when the police stopped him, took his identification card and sent him home. Not to be deterred, he began the trip again, this time riding more than a hundred miles on a bicycle, making detours to avoid the police and sleeping in barns at night. He was determined to assemble with Jehovah’s people, and he did. And so did 19,100 others, many of whom risked their lives and their freedom to be present!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After the Berlin assembly came to a close, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Spandauer Volksblatt</span><span class="font14"> reported: “2,000 men and 1,000 women are said to have been imprisoned in the Soviet zone since 1950 because of their activity as 'Jehovah’s witnesses’ . . . 446 members of the religious association are said to be still incarcerated. Just during this year eighty-one persons have been sentenced. . .. Sentences of twenty-five years penal work and deportations to Siberia have been passed in the Soviet Union.” It is obvious that these faithful Christian witnesses behind the Iron Curtain have not let up in doing the divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In South Africa thirteen assemblies were held. The laws there do not permit the different races to meet together, so in some places it was necessary to have more than one assembly in order to accommodate the many people who love the truth. The brothers appreciated the arrangements made and showed it by the effort they put forth to be present. One brother with seven children, convinced that it was the divine will for them to be present, spent his last £16 to attend the assembly. The blessings of the occasion were well worth it. He called to mind the assurance of the Lord Jesus, who said: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33) He had complete faith that it would be so, and that neither he nor his children would go hungry. Although he did not have a secular job waiting for him when he arrived home, it was not long until he found one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Farther to the north, in Sierra Leone, it was reported that there were ten newly interested persons in attendance for every one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In one group three brothers brought along with them sixteen Kissi-speaking persons of goodwill. They had no automobile or train or bus by which to travel, and reports had reached them that the bridge over a large river that they must cross had been washed out. But with faith they made the trip, seven and a half hours on foot to the flooded river. Then, with luggage piled on their heads, they waded through water that reached to their necks, and continued the trip to the assembly site. How happy they were to gather with Jehovah’s people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When those of the New World society meet together, they do not close the doors and tell everyone else to stay out. Not only are all persons of good will welcome, but they are encouraged to attend these meetings and enjoy the heart-warming Bible discourses and discussions. In Burma one special pioneer went three hundred miles out of his way to bring an elderly Chin person to the assembly in Rangoon. And in Antwerp, Belgium, an eleven-year-old boy stationed himself outside the assembly hall to welcome the public. As people passed the entranceway he would politely approach them and personally invite them to come in to hear the public talk. More than forty persons attended as a direct result of that good work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Public Took Note</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">From French Equatorial Africa comes the report that Jehovah’s witnesses were able to meet for their first public conventions there. They had to construct their own enclosure for the assembly in Brazzaville, but no effort was too great for this event. They were thrilled to have a total attendance of 10,090 at their three assemblies. Not only did the witnesses enjoy them, but others were deeply impressed with the co-operation and law-abiding behavior of the witnesses. When one man saw the Lost and Found department at the assembly he said: “Truly the witnesses of Jehovah are not like us. By us; when the Catholics arrange for a feast we have to take much precautions because they steal our bicycles, our hats, and especially when we lose some money, who comes and returns it to us? But here, they show you the bracelets, the watches, the earrings, the handkerchiefs and even the money that was found! In truth, the witnesses of Jehovah are different.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the British Isles, where four assemblies were held, the diligent efforts in the ministry on the part of the brothers were evident from the fact that the total attendance of 48,833 for the public meeting at the four assemblies showed an increase of 32 percent over the figure for the previous year. Regarding the baptism at the North London assembly a television commentator said: “Five hundred and sixtyeight new ministers were ordained today, the second day of Jehovah’s witnesses’ assembly at Harringay.... At this ceremony it is the children who watch. Each witness becomes a preacher. This makes them the world’s largest single body of ministers.” Each one of them has made a study of God’s Word, believes it and has made up his mind to live by it and teach it to others. At the Divine Will International Assembly in New York the largest Christian baptism in history was held when 7,136 were immersed. During the four months that followed, nearly ten thousand more were baptized at the seventy-nine other assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Three of those assemblies were held in Italy, with an increase of 145 percent in attendance over the assembly held there just four years ago. At the assembly in Florence to the north the police did their utmost to assure that no one would infringe upon the right of the brothers to assemble, and they even asked if they might enter the hall to listen to the talks. However, quite a different picture presented itself in Naples on the southern coast; the local authorities did all they could to prevent the assembly. But when a protest was registered with the authorities in Rome and the government brought pressure to bear on the local police to keep their hands off, the police decided they had made a “mistake,” and the assembly was held, with 1,160 present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In many places the number of newly interested ones outnumbered those of Jehovah’s witnesses who were present. Sometimes the public accounted for half the audience, sometimes for two thirds or more. And how did they feel about the things they saw and heard?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A Danish businessman who had passed the assembly grounds in Copenhagen several times decided to attend on Sunday. After hearing part of the program he sent word home for his son ro come ana near the rest of the talks with him. At the same assembly a Pentecostal woman told a publisher: “At a prayer meeting this week we prayed that Jehovah’s witnesses would get rained out. But I got so curious I had to come over and see for myself, and it is overwhelming. It cannot be denied, God’s spirit is truly here among you people.” At the conclusion of the Finnish assembly in Helsinki a woman remarked: “I have been in many religious meetings, but it is only here that I have learned something.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, they learned the divine will. Jehovah’s witnesses love God, they appreciate his Word of truth, and they are eager to do all they can to help others to learn it. A newspaper report in Jamaica expressed its impression this way: “By 9 p.m. thousands of spiritually well-fed Witnesses and their friends were leaving the grounds. . .. With arms full of books and heads full of knowledge and hearts overflowing with love for God and his ‘other sheep’ weary Witnesses started wending their way to their homes, more determined than ever to carry out the Divine Will until Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is not just talk; true Christians live their religion and others recognize that fact. One of the technical directors of the assembly site used in Lille, France, said this about it when speaking to a group of Catholic priests following the assembly: “Jehovah’s witnesses have an unexplainable force which animates them in their work and which manifests itself in their love for each other and in the joy they experience. They prove by their work, and not by loud talk, that they are accomplishing the Divine Will, for such was the title of their assembly. After many years of service, where I have been in contact with many organizations, I must admit that I have been able to work best with Jehovah’s witnesses and this has made me reflect a lot. You cannot compare yourselves to the strength of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The French people responded warmly to the assemblies, and in Paris the facilities were overflowed with an attendance of 4,226, over double the seating capacity of the hall. Even with all overflow space being used, it was impossible for everyone to get in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is no question about it, many who attended these conventions learned things from the Bible that have changed their lives. For the first time many of them understood what the divine will is for them and they wanted to do something about it. A paramount chief in Africa was so moved by what he heard that following the assembly he offered to build a Kingdom Hall for his people if the Society would only send someone to teach them about God’s kingdom. When two brothers accepted the invitation and went there to put on a special public lecture, they were greeted by an audience of four hundred persons!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The scope of the Divine Will assemblies as they have reached out to many nations has made it very clear that the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses reaches beyond the barriers that divide the old world and embraces persons of “all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” (Rev. 7:9) Jehovah’s witnesses are interested in their brothers and in other people, regardless of their nationality, race or language. They want to help them to learn the divine will, and these assemblies have better equipped them to do it. They have also stimulated the interest of many other persons who are beginning to realize that Jehovah God does have people on earth who really serve him and who are anxious to aid others to do the same.</span></p><img src="g_E_19570308_files/g_E_19570308-13.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:122pt;">
<p><span class="font24">A</span><span class="font14"> DEVOUT Lutheran widow at nigh seventy years was still working hard in a New York city garment factory. She had obtained a number of Watch Tower publications and now one of Jehovah’s witnesses was making a return visit. The minister told her, among other things, the need of personal Bible study. This caused her to exclaim: “Catholics are not allowed even to have a Bible in their homes. They are not allowed to read the Bible. I tell you the Catholic Church is the antichrist. Yes, the Catholic Church must be the antichrist!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Passing over her assertions regarding Catholics and the Bible as not germane to this discussion, we note that hers is a common tendency among Bible lovers, to label as antichrist those whom they fear or dislike. Thus some early Christians are said to have termed the cities that refused to hear Jesus, Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum and Jerusalem as antichrists. (Matt. 11:21-23) A little later others termed Nero, persecutor of Christians, the antichrist And centuries later, as Islam’s armies forcibly converted professed Christians to their faith, others termed Mohammed the antichrist. By the time of the “Reformation Catholics were calling Martin Luther antichrist, while Luther, Calvin and other reformers were calling the pope of Rome and his religious organization antichrist. There still are many Protestants who are of this opinion, such as the Lutheran lady mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Today many modernists and higher critics among the clergy take the position that the Christian religion is the result of a gradual development on the part of man in his quest for God. These are apt to associate the antichrist idea with the ancient past. They claim to trace the antichrist back through Antiochus Epiphanes, persecutor of the Jews in the time of the Maccabees, to ancient Iranian and Babylonian myths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For those who accept the Scriptures as God’s inspired Word antichrist is not a mythical development but is of prophetic significance, having both the thought of being opposed to Christ and that of taking the place of Christ. In his great prophecy Jesus foretold that many false christs would come. (Matt. 24:24) Paul also was referring to the antichrist when he wrote: “Let no one seduce you in any manner, because [the day of Jehovah] will not come unless the falling away comes first and the man of lawlessness gets revealed, the son of destruction.”—2 Thess. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, it is only the apostle John that specifically names the antichrist, doing so five times in his letters: “Many deceivers have gone forth into the world, persons not confessing Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist.” “This is the antichrist, the one that denies the Father and the Son.” “Every inspired expression that does not confess Jesus ... is the antichrist’s inspired expression.” “Just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now there have come to be many antichrists.” —2 John 7; 1 John 2:22; 4:3; 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In brief, the term antichrist includes all persons and organizations that are opposed to Christ and his kingdom as these are identified in the Scriptures, be those opposers pagan or professedly Christian, be theirs political opposition or religious. It would therefore include all those who deny that Jesus came in the flesh, who deny that he was “produced out of a woman,” that he “became flesh,” but who insist that he was a member of the trinity, both God and man while on earth, an incarnation. Also included are those who deny that Jesus actually “came” from heaven, that he had a prehuman existence. Denying his statements such as, “Before Abraham came into existence, I have been,” they show themselves to be against Christ, antichrists.—Gal. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">4:4;</span><span class="font14"> John 1:14; 8:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The term antichrist would also apply to those who show their opposition to Christ by denying his plain statements regarding one of his purposes for coming to earth, such as: “The Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” —Matt 20:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">All who oppose God’s kingdom by Christ are also antichrists. Regarding these the Resolution passed last summer by Jehovah’s witnesses at their Divine Will assembly noted: “The clergy have turned their backs on Jesus Christ the King and have endorsed the political organizations for perpetuating this old world, which is God’s enemy, namely, the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations; and they have led and encouraged the people in the idolizing of these human makeshifts for God’s kingdom.” Their idol, the United Nations, is therefore also an antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And so is the Communist rule that Russia’s leaders foist upon mankind. While these leaders may with some logic point to Christendom’s hypocritical course of action, they themselves have nothing better to offer—to say the least—and prove themselves to be both hypocrites and antichrists by their persecuting the spokesmen of Christ’s kingdom on the baseless charge of sedition, as well as by idolizing their own form of man-rule, substituting it for Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And finally, the Scriptures indicate that the term “antichrist” also applies to those who once dedicated themselves to do God’s will and then fell away or who entered the Christian congregation for selfish reasons. Paul referred to these in his farewell address to the overseers at Ephesus: “Oppressive wolves will enter in among you . . . and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.” These are the antichrists that John spoke of that 'went out from among us because they were not of our kind.’ Those taking this course in our day Jesus described in his great prophecy as an evil slave that would beat his fellows and associate with confirmed drunkards—Acts 20:29, 30; 1 John 2:19; Matt. 24:48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Thus we see that “antichrist” is a Scriptural term that applies only since the coming of the Christ, God’s anointed One, as a man on earth and to any persons and organizations that are against Christ or that would substitute for him and his kingdom. This includes all those who deny that Jesus is the Messiah, that he came as a man, that he had a prehuman existence and that his Kingdom is mankind’s only hope. It also includes all those who are </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">anti</span><span class="font14"> Christ’s true followers, be they religious or political opposers. Since Christ as king is to dash to pieces all his enemies, the wise course for all who would gain everlasting life is to separate themselves from all antichrists and associate with those who give evidence of being Christ’s true followers.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Chile</span></h6>
<p><span class="font24">S</span><span class="font14">CHOOL children often refer to Chile as “the shoestring country in South America that is famous for its saltpeter and copper.” Tourists know Chile to be a land of changing vistas and favorable monetary exchange. But to the Chilean, this strip of soil along the western line of South America is, in the words of the nation’s anthem, “Sweet Homeland—the happy copy of Eden.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Chileans like to talk of their country’s minerals, crops and locations of unspoiled Eden-like beauty. They tell of volcanic mineral water springs. The therapeutic fame of these waters brings people from far beyond the national frontiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This calls to mind another kind of healing waters that are being made available to the more than 6,000,000 inhabitants of the land, symbolic waters of truth coming forth from the Fountain of Life to men of good will. Those who administer these life-giving waters are Jehovah’s witnesses. They meet in more than forty congregations. These witnesses are busily engaged in dispensing truths from God’s Word that lead people to freedom and life. Therefore, their work is symbolically described for us In Revelation 22:1,2 as being God-given for the spiritual healing of the nations. In every part of Chile these Christian ministers are to be found freely applying the counsel of Christ Jesus, at Revelation 22: 17: “And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” There are more than 1,300 active witnesses of Jehovah freely spreading these healing waters of truths throughout Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the dry mineral desert tracts of the rainless north these waters of life are appreciated by the people. A traveling representative of the Watch Tower Society calls on them regularly. More often than not his means of transportation from one place to another in this section is by means of the lowly burro. Interest in God’s kingdom is great in these parts. This minister is able to place as many as a thousand copies of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font14"> magazines in a single month with these people!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the central zone, Rancagua, a city of over 40,000 population, was the recipient of a veritable deluge of these healing waters during the four-day Life-giving Wisdom District Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. The hospitality of the people was outstanding. The Municipal Stadium with all its fine accommodations was freely donated. In spite of clergy denunciations and threats of excommunication, the rooming committee reported lodging over three hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses in private homes and another three hundred in fourteen small hotels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As a result of the city-wide witness that was given from house-to-house preaching and the publicity that the press and radio devoted to the four-day assembly, the people of Rancagua learned to distinguish Jehovah’s witnesses from people of other religions. Since the assembly was held the local congregation has tripled the number of revisits that it is making on people who have shown interest in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. They have also doubled the number of home Bible studies that they have been conducting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A director of a radio station was contacted during this time. He expressed a desire to co-operate in any way possible. When a brother from the public relations department called on him, the director offered two fifteen-minute periods a day during the assembly and four twenty-minute programs on succeeding Sundays. This man said: “I admire you people for your zeal and your faith. Though not one of you, I have the greatest sympathy for your work and the way you do it.” He seemed to be impressed with the regularity and the devotion of the witnesses to their Godgiven work. But such constancy is normal with Jehovah’s witnesses because they take to heart Paul’s words to Timothy: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all long-suffering and art of teaching.”—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This four-day assembly, however, was not without the usual opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. Saturday noon, the third day of the assembly, under the auspices of the Women’s League, the archbishop gave a half-hour radio discourse slandering the witnesses and falsely accusing them of possessing no Biblical knowledge, of being materialistic and of having communistic beliefs, this because they do not believe in the pagan doctrine of the immortality of the soul. It may be that the archbishop has never read what the Bible has to say about the soul at Ezekiel 18:4 (AS); “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sin-neth, it shall die.” The Bible clearly says the soul dies. Therefore, it could not be immortal, but mortal. The archbishop, however, prefers to believe otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the main lecture of the assembly, a police official in charge of a detachment of five policemen arrived. The officer said that he had heard the archbishop’s radio attack and that it had so infuriated him to think that such an important and cultured man would do such a thing that he of his own accord had come to hear the lecture and to see that Jehovah’s witnesses were not molested in any way as a result of what had been said. So people of all kinds are responding to the Kingdom message as it is being preached in all the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Project </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">SCORE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The U.S. fired into space on December 15 a vehicle held to be the largest man-made &quot;moon&quot; to date. The Air Force effort, called Project SCORE, carried into orbit an 8,600-pound Atlas intercontinental missile 85 feet long and ten feet in diameter. The projectile, originally weighing 244,000 pounds, dropped its booster engines and went into an elliptical orbit around the earth with an estimated altitude of about 925 miles at its highest point and 114.5 miles at its lowest point. A message conveying &quot;America’s wish for peace on earth and good will toward men everywhere,” recorded by U.S. President Eisenhower, was carried aloft and later relayed by the satellite. This message was also transmitted by means of electronic teletypewriter signals. Still later scientists sent a recorded message to the instrumented Atlas and this too was successfully relayed. The new man-made space traveler was expected to remain in orbit about twenty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Talk War over Berlin</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On November 27 Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev sent a note to Western powers demanding their withdrawal from West Berlin. The Russians asserted that it was their intention to turn Berlin into a</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">D</span><span class="font13">emilitarized independent city, /estern proposals that the status of Berlin be considered along with the problem of German reunification met with Moscow’s disapproval. On December 19 a Soviet spokesman threatened the U.S. with “annihilating defeat” if it were to resort to armed force against the Communists in Berlin. A 7,000-word memorandum issued by the U.S. State Department held that rights of the U.S. in Germany and in West Berlin were not dependent upon the &quot;acquiescence of the Soviet Union.” East German Communist officials declared, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font13"> December 21, that not even &quot;American bayonets” could assure the Western powers’ position in West Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">NATO Ministers Meet</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; The problem of Berlin figured prominently in discussions by representatives of the fifteen member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Paris December 16 to 18. Other matters, such as economic problems and the Cyprus situation, were also discussed. The NATO ministers were unanimous in rejecting current Soviet demands for evacuation of West Berlin. The NATO nations desire to negotiate with Russia on the German problem as a whole but this is not acceptable to the Soviets. A communique released</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;" on the final day of the Paris gathering, December 18, </span><span class="font13">urged the Russians to join in negotiations for settling various problems in Europe. Moscow was also warned that &quot;nuclear retaliatory forces&quot; would be used if necessary to defend West Berlin. On December 19 General Lauris Norstad, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, warned that aggressors against NATO nations would be risking &quot;total annihilation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Test-Ban Treaty</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">-£■ Technicians of the East and West, representing </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain, </span><span class="font13">the U.S. and the Soviet Union, opened meetings in Geneva on October 31 to discuss methods of policing a nuclear test ban. On December 12 it was reported that the conferees had agreed upon the third article of a test-ban treaty. During the previous week the experts had acknowledged the need pi a control system and had agreed that any nation should be free to sign the completed treaty, The third article outlined the composition of an international control organization. A U.S. proposal suggesting the establishment of internationally staffed permanent inspection stations throughout the world later met with Soviet disapproval. The Russians favor control posts that are manned almost exclusively by nationals of the country in which these are situated. They also demand veto power within the prospective seven-member commission of the control organization. The conference was recessed on December 19 after agreement had been achieved on four articles </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">a prospective treaty. Spokesmen for all three delegations indicated, however, that major issues relating to a </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">test-ban </span><span class="font13">suspension were still unsettled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Surprise Attack &quot;Talks Close </span><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; East-West talks on methods of preventing surprise attack, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">held In Geneva since November 10, were adjourned on De</span><span class="font13">cember 18. The ten-nation flve-week-old discussions had brought forth no agreement or clear understanding between technicians from Britain, France, Canada, Italy, and the U.S. and experts from Russia, Poland, Romania, Albania and Czechoslovakia. The West had favored international observa-<sup>l</sup>tlon groups and inspection systems that might guard against missile attacks and the mobilization of ground forces. Spokesmen of the Eastern bloc attempted to bring into these talks matters that the West considered to be of a political nature. Technicians of the Soviet bloc maintained that the establishment of an atom-free zone in central Europe and various other disarmament measures should be considered by the conferees. When the parley adjourned indefinitely on December 18, agreement had not even been reached on a suitable agenda. A final communique expressed the hope that the talks would be resumed “as early as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Mao Relinquishes Post</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&amp; Since 1949 Mao Tse-tung ■ has been undisputed head of Communist China. It was announced on December 16 that 65-year-old Mao had decided not to seek re-election as the Peiping regime’s chief of state. Some sources felt that difficulties encountered in bringing the country’s peasant population into abject servitude to the political state by means of “peoples’ communes” had been partly responsible for Mao’s decision to relinquish his post. Peiping's Central Committee, in a 10,000-word document released on December 18, indicated that there would be a siow-down in the conversion to communes. Further, there would be no immediate large-scale attempt to enforce such communal living upon inhabitants of urban areas. Disruption of family life and dissatisfaction with labor conditions and wages were held to be the prime factors impeding progress in the changeover to communes. Peiping still intends to pursue the same basic policies it has followed in this regard heretofore, but all indications point to a more gradual future changeover. While Mao has given up his position as chief of state, he still continues. as head of the Chinese Communist party and thus retains his prestige,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Bulganin Speaks</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Former Soviet Premier Nikolai A. Bulganin spoke at a session of Moscow’s Central Committee on December 18. Now demoted to the chairmanship of an economic council in the northern Caucasus, Bulganin stated that while he was premier he had been associated with an anti-Party group made up of V. M. Molotov, Georgi Malenkov, Lazar Kaganovich and Dmitri Shepilov. The ex-premier said that he had been not only an accomplice of the reactionaries, but also &quot;nominally their leader.” He further declared that the group &quot;met in my office and there concerted their anti-Party reactionary work.” Ac-cording to Bulganin, their moves included opposition to Nikita S. Khrushchev’s plan for agricultural reform. Khrushchev, in a 38,000-word message to the Central Committee, admitted that the Soviet Union “is still seriously lagging behind the U.S.” in farm production. Part of his plan for overcoming these weaknesses was indicated by the comment: &quot;The time has come to organize, not only in towns but also in collective farms, communal dining halls, laundries, bakeries and nurseries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Welcome in Baghdad</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;&amp; Arriving in Baghdad on a Mideast fact-finding mission, Assistant Secretary of State William Rountree was met on December 15 by crowds of shouting demonstrators. Stones, eggs, and mud struck the U.S. Embassy’s limousine in which Rountree left the airport. Shouts of &quot;Go home, Rountree!” were chorused over and over again and similar slogans were found on banners held aloft by irate young Iraqis. Rountree was afforded adequate military protection and escaped injury. A military guard was also provided for the U.S. Embassy. In Washington a State Department spokesman attributed the demonstrations to &quot;irresponsible and apparently subversive elements.” Rountree later reported that he had been well received by the government and that his discussions with Iraqi officials had been &quot;useful and friendly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">President De Gaulle</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">General Charles de Gaulle was elected to the presidency of the Fifth French Republic on December 21. The 68-year-old soldier-statesman won over 78 percent of the 79,468 valid votes cast by an electoral college representing metropolitan France and lands within the French Overseas Community. The new president will hold vast powers accorded him under provisions of the new French Constitution approved in a referendum held in September. De Gaulle’s seven-year term as president was scheduled to begin on January 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Algeria: Military Rule Ends</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Forty-four-year-old Paul Delouvrler became France’s Delegate-General in Algeria on December 12. On the same date General Raoul Sa Ian was relieved of his position as head of a military-civilian combine that had been ruling that land since the overthrow of the Fourth French Republic on May 13. Salan was subsequent</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ly appointed Inspector-General </span><span class="font13">of National </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Defense. Con</span><span class="font13">sequently, Algeria's administration came directly under the supervision of French leader Charles de Gaulle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Castro Rebellion</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&amp; For many months the government of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista has been battling with insurgent forces led by Fidel Castro. As a step toward quelling rebel activities a state of emergency was decreed throughout Cuba on December 12. This was to last </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font13">forty-five days. During that period Batista would be free to take whatever steps he deemed advisable in coping with the Castro rebellion. Similar decrees had been issued previously, the last having ended in July. A rebel radio report on December 17 declared that insurgents had seized some government-owned prop</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">erties In Las Villas province. Thus the Castro movement </span><span class="font13">continued despite the imposition of a state of emergency throughout the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Cyprus: Toward a Solution?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Greece made a bid on December 12 for the co-operation of Turkey in working out a solution to the current crisis in Cyprus. A British plan inviting both Athens and Ankara to send representatives to Nicosia to join in a “partnership” rule of the island has met with neither Greek nor Turkish approval. On December 18 a last-minute reprieve by Governor Sir Hugh Foot, granted to two convicted terrorists and commuting their death sentences to life imprisonment, served somewhat to reduce tension on Cyprus. On that same date British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd, Greek Foreign Minister Evangelos Averoff and Turkish Foreign Minister Fatin Zorlu met in Paris to discuss the problem of Cyprus. This was the first time since 1955 that representatives of the three governments had conferred on the matter. The results of this and a subsequent contact on December 20 were not revealed.</span></p>
