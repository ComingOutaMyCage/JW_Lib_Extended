<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1957 YEARBOOK </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">W</span><span class="font4">HERE is your heart? Is it toward your Maker, Jehovah, or does it move you to act as the godless, degenerate world acts? You must always keep in mind that “Jehovah . . . sees what the heart is.’’ (1 Sam. 16:7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Without question the Most High God of the universe can discern your motives; he knows what treasures you seek. King David told Solomon: “Know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul, for all hearts Jehovah is searching and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning. If you search for him he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him he will reject you forever.” (1 Chron. 28:9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Everyone whose heart is for God can find him. But those who turn their back on God he will not help. No one can hide his deeds from view, because “the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah.”—Prov. 5:21, AS.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font4">Paul realized this. He first tried to serve Jehovah God under the then rejected Mosaic law system, as a Pharisee, and thought it his duty as a Jew to persecute Christ’s followers, “both men and women” of “the Way”—this newly formed religion. (Acts 9:1, 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> However, when he was forcefully shown the truth he turned around, forsook his old religious practices, now outmoded, and became “a slave of Jesus Christ and called to be an apostle.” (Rom. 1:1, 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">From the old system of things that existed in his day Paul was “separated to God’s good news.” His heart was no longer in the old Jewish, hyp-</span><span class="font0">5 </span><span class="font4">ocritical system of things. He had learned of the resurrected Christ Jesus; so of the hope of life eternal he had now become a zealous minister. Paul was known throughout all Palestine, Asia Minor and Greece, as well as Rome, because he would “from day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> In his many travels he had a fine opportunity to observe how mankind was living. Visiting place after place in a very corrupt world he was “not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact, God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith.” He preached to Jews and Greeks, meaning believers and nonbelievers in Jehovah God. Through this message of good news God’s righteousness was being revealed. Paul had learned God’s Word by diligent study. He knew that “the righteous man will live by means of faith.”—Rom. 1:16, 17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font4"> Hab. 2:4, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a true Christian Paul was not hesitant about telling of the wrath of God against all ungodliness and unrighteousness. In his letter to the Romans he wrote very plainly. You can easily understand what he means by reading Romans 1:18-32 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(NW). </span><span class="font4">According to Paul’s argument, God had manifested himself to all men and the Almighty’s invisible qualities were clearly seen from the world’s creation onward. Even though men and women of the world knew God they certainly did not glorify him as God, nor did they thank him for all the good things they had. Instead they were empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent hearts became darkened. Nearly all humans became extremely foolish. Men and women stooped to a very low, depraved manner of living. Paul’s description proves his day was no different from ours. Right now we, like Paul, can say: “That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites.” They were then and are now “violently inflamed in their lust toward one another,” both males and females “working what is obscene.” While they had opportunity to hear the truth and act properly, they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, saying, ‘Why spend time taking in knowledge of God when we can run wild with the world?’ Unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness filled the world of Paul’s day. People did injury to one another. They were full of envy, strife, deceit and murder. These things were rampant and all were insolent and haughty, haters of God. Children were disobedient to their parents. Natural affection was unknown among them; all were merciless. After vividly describing his day, Paul added: “Although these know full well the righteous decree of God, that those practicing such things are deserving of death, they not only keep on doing them but also approve those practicing them.”—Rom. 1:32, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today Paul’s strong words are equally applicable. To all mankind, in Christendom and parts of the world where worship of heathen gods prevails, we, with Paul, now can say: “You are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are, if you judge; for in the thing in which you judge another, you condemn yourself, inasmuch as you that judge practice the same things. Now we know that the judgment of God is, in accord with truth, against those who practice such things. But do you have this idea, O man, while you judge those who practice such things and yet you do them, that you will escape the judgment of God?” (Rom. 2:1-3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> In other words, “The ways of mem are before the eyes of Jehovah.” So where is your heart—with this debauchery or against it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Foremost statesmen of this present evil world are telling people everywhere how to run their affairs, how government should be handled and how to live at peace. But what do we find? Anxiety among the rulers, depravity among the peoples, distress among the nations. Today all nations (regardless of claims still by some to be Christian) have hardened their hearts against God and his kingdom. They do not want that kingdom. (Matt. 6:10; 24:9) They are against being ruled by God, Jehovah, and by His enthroned King, Christ Jesus. (Ps. 2:1-3; Dan. 2:44; 12:1, AS; Acts 4:24-30; Matt. 24:9, 15; Rev. 11:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Apply Paul’s words, therefore, to the nations now: “According to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath and of the revealing of God’s righteous judgment. And he will render to each one according to his works: everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good; however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and anger, tribulation and distress, upon the soul of every man who works what is injurious, of the Jew first and also of the Greek; but glory and honor and peace for everyone who works what is good, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. For there is no partiality with God.”—Rom. 2:5-11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that you are a citizen of a certain nation or a member of a particular religion will not shield you from God’s wrath. Where is your heart? Where is your treasure? Do you love righteousness? Do you want to live? If you do, then know the one true God of Abraham, of Moses, of David, of Jeremiah, of Jesus Christ, of Paul and other early Christians and of today’s true Christians, and with all of those God-fearing men and women “serve him [Jehovah] with a complete heart and with a delightful soul.” Remember, it is written: “He will render to each one according to his works.”</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>WRONG THINKING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Now the majority of the people get mixed up in their thinking. It is unpopular to be too religious-minded, or to be talking to friends about the Bible. Christendom’s religion is something one uses only on Sunday, and on that day it is thought on for just an hour while the people listen to grand organ music, join themselves in singing a few songs and also enjoy choir singing. They listen to the hired clergyman talk for twenty minutes or so from the pulpit. His talk may be based on the Bible or some other book or even politics. For the great majority of people who practice some religion that is the extent of their religious thinking for one week. There are a few, but very few, who regularly read and study God’s Word, the Bible, and talk it unashamedly to others. As for being guided by God’s Word, very little thought is given to the Bible. Recently it was reported that in the United States 100,162,529 persons belong to some religion. (New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> September 10, 1956, pages 1, 25) That leaves about 68,000,000 of this country’s people unaffiliated with any religious organization. Quoting the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The statistics were gathered by the council [National Council of Churches of Christ in the U. S. A.] from 258 religious bodies. They reported a total membership of 100,162,529, or 60.9 per cent of the population. These religious bodies define membership in different terms. The Roman Catholic Church counts all baptized persons, including infants. Protestant churches usually count only those who have attained full membership. Most are 13 years of age or older. . . . Church membership increased by 2.8 per cent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But what about child delinquency and crime in the United States? Such things too have increased. According to news reports day by day the moral standard is very low. To quote from the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> (September 27, 1956, page 37):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Federal Bureau of Investigation predicted today [Sept. 26] that if present trends continued 2,500,000 major crimes would be committed in the country this year. It would be the highest total in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On the basis of current records, 1956 will be the fifth consecutive year in which major crimes have exceeded the 2,000,000 figure, according to J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the F. B. I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“He made public reports showing a 14.4 per cent increase in major crimes in the first six months of the year, the largest recorded since the corresponding period in 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Major crimes, in the F. B. I. lexicon, are murder, negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and automobile theft. There were 1,191,120 offenses in these categories in the first half of the year. This was an increase of 162,770. . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question must be asked, Is Christendom’s religion helping America? Is it helping the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With adults and youth having little or no spiritual guidance, how can one expect their thinking to be along righteous lines? All Christendom must bear the responsibility for the world’s condition, together with America as one of its leading nations. Their fruits do not prove them to be Christian. Being so absorbed in the things of this world, praying for its wars, instilling hatred between nations and letting their flocks be scattered, the false religious organizations have set the pattern of life for their shepherds and their flocks. Their moral condition today is exactly like that of Paul’s time. Life’s material things have made big inroads upon the thinking and daily acts of those in Christendom. Spiritual-mindedness has been crowded out. Very few really seek the kingdom of God. (Matt. 6:33) In childhood millions had been taught the prayer Christ Jesus taught his followers to pray: ‘Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as in heaven.’ (Matt. 6:9-13) Now ask yourself, How many people who have prayed this prayer once or more times in their lives are really seeking the kingdom of God? Early Christians prayed it, believed it, lived it, preached it. ‘From day to day they would tell the good news of salvation by Jehovah.’ But how many in Christendom do that today? Today’s thinking is wrong! The people have no inclination for spiritual things, “where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break in and steal.” (Matt. 6:20, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> That is why Paul wrote to faithful followers of Christ: “Finally, brothers, we request you and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, just as you received the instruction from us on how you ought to walk and please God, just as you are in fact walking, that you would keep on doing it more fully. For you know the orders we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For this is what God wills, the sanctifying of you, that you abstain from fornication; that each one of you should know how to get possession of his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in covetous sexual appetite such as also those nations have which do not know God; that no one go to the point of harming and encroach upon the rights of his brother in this matter, because Jehovah is one who exacts punishment for all these things, just as we told you beforehand and also gave you a thorough witness. For God called us, not with allowance for uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification. So, then, the man that shows disregard is disregarding, not man, but God, who puts his holy spirit in you.” —1 Thess. 4:1-8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul knew that the influence of the world would affect those taking up the Christian course. So he constantly gave them sound admonition. He knew that the early Christians who were seeking God’s kingdom were walking properly and so he said, ‘You are walking the right way.’ But he urged them to do it more fully. There was a little slipping on their part and he knew that eventually this would lead to others’ doing the same thing, until the material riches of this world would become more attractive than the spiritual riches. Paul knew, as Jesus had taught, that where the heart of a Christian was, there his treasure would be. But if the Christian no longer tried to store up treasures in heaven then that one would have begun to store up treasures on earth, where moth and rust would begin to corrupt. When one looks at Christendom he sees it as a worldly organization, barren of all spirituality. A person who wants to be pleasing to Jehovah must come out of her and seek good food, life-sustaining words from Jehovah, and turn to God. He must ‘serve Jehovah with a complete heart.’ Christendom and its shepherds have failed its people. All Christendom’s nations and all other nations and peoples have forsaken God and his kingdom. The only way for you to gain the favor and blessing of Jehovah is: “If you search for him he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him he will reject you forever.” (1 Chron. 28:9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Search and you will find!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The individual who wants to serve God and truly dedicate his life to Jehovah and sanctify himself, by setting himself aside for righteous service to preach God’s good news, is going to find it hard going. He will be running against the broad current of modern-day civilization. He will meet up with much tribulation. But it is worth it, because you will be on the right side, Jehovah’s side. Concerning our time Jesus clearly stated: “Then people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name. Then, also, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and mislead many; and because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off. But he that has endured to the finish is the one that will be saved. And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.”—Matt. 24:9-14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>TRUE RICHES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Today from the ends of the earth, as well as from Christendom, have come hundreds of thousands of persons who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah’s service. They have expressed themselves as wanting to do his will. They have studied the Word of God and are continuing to do so, for they want to store up treasure in heaven. A true Christian experiences a rich blessing when he follows the commandments of Jehovah God. An individual wanting true riches, lasting riches, must come to appreciate that it is important for him to have a close relationship with the Creator. In Proverbs 10:22 (AS) it is written: “The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; and he addeth no sorrow therewith.” No one acquainted with world conditions will say that in this world there is no sorrow. It is filled with sorrow. The world is not rich in spiritual knowledge. Yet scattered throughout this whole world, but not a part of it, are found true Christians, rich in spiritual qualifications. These have received of the undeserved kindness of Jehovah; they have recognized his Son, Christ Jesus, and they are determined to walk in his footsteps and do his work that must be done in these last days of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such faithful followers of Christ Jesus can say: “For we all received from out of his fullness, even undeserved kindness upon undeserved kindness. Because the law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.”—John 1:16, 17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the Scriptures the law given by Jehovah to Moses served as a schoolmaster to lead certain people to Christ Jesus. (Gal. 3:23-25; Matt 5:17) Now we appreciate that Christ Jesus, the Son of God, has come. He has laid down his life for redeeming obedient ones of mankind, and he has made it possible for individuals to become Christians, Christlike, his followers. (Heb. 5:9; 1 Pet. 2:21; 1 John 2:2) This has all been accomplished by the undeserved kindness of God and the truth Jehovah revealed to Christians through Christ Jesus. This truth, written in the Bible, is now available in nearly all languages of earth. Anyone who wants to have access to the Bible today can get one and read it or have it read to him. The Bible has had the greatest circulation of any book ever published. Jehovah’s witnesses are doing everything they possibly can to distribute the Bible itself in all parts of the world, as well as to aid people to understand that written Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate the undeserved kindness of God, for it has had a telling effect upon their lives. While they, as faithful followers of Christ Jesus, have tasted of the undeserved kindness of God it is the Devil’s purpose to turn all of them away from God and bring them back into his fold. While Jehovah operates on the principle of love, the Devil operates on the theory of selfishness and he has had his whole worldly organization work accordingly. Selfishness breeds covetousness; so the Bible contains much warning against being covetous. Jesus said: “Be on the alert and on guard against every kind of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15; Ex. 20:17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Life is a gift from God through his Son, Christ Jesus. It is not something that Jehovah God owes us. God would have all men living together in peace and prosperity and loving their neighbors just as they love themselves; but that is not man’s inclination today. He inclines toward selfishness, because he does not know God and God’s ways, and because he prefers to serve the interests of this old world and the Devil, Jehovah’s adversary. Through today’s selfish system of things minds of young and old alike are constantly stirred to ‘be rich.’ Most people seriously think that life depends on one’s abundance, so they put forth every effort to get that abundance, even to losing good name, reputation, health and friends. For benefit of all Christians Paul wrote: “However, those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.” —1 Tim. 6:9,10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes, some who have even lived as Christians drift back to old-world ways and do all sorts of injurious things. But they hurt principally themselves. They stray from the fundamental teachings of Christ Jesus and before they know it they have stabbed themselves all over and they are filled with pain. Sorrows fill their days, rather than the joy and happiness Jehovah God gives to those who love and trust him. Today, as in Jesus’ time, we find some who work day and night to accumulate wealth to fill their own storehouse. They think their security and life come from the abundance they themselves have gathered. We read the rich man’s words: “So he said: . . . ‘Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.’ But God said to him: ‘Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’ So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:18-21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">Earthly riches one can quickly lose. Look how millions in Europe lost all their savings, their homes, their farms, their business, because some selfish dictator directed his forces to annihilate them. Two world wars of our time and all previous wars have helped the Devil to turn men’s minds away from God. For loss of their gathered material riches many bitterly blame God. But if such persons had been enriched with the Word of God, then they would have known in advance the futility of storing up earthly riches that thieves steal and moth and rust corrupt. In times of stress spiritual riches have sustaining power and keep one thinking straight. Dictators have come and gone, and there are still some existing today who feel that the world was made for them to rule, that all people should be under their heel. There are big dictators and little dictators. Both kinds are selfish, whether running a nation or a small business. The dictator’s mind is centered just around himself and the abundance that he can gather together. He does not realize that life does not result from the things that he possesses. All the old world’s possessions a person may have will not give him everlasting life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>A GIFT FROM GOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">God’s Word clearly declares that life is a gift from God. (Rom. 6:23; Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Through undeserved kindness on Jehovah’s part life comes to creatures; and it was because of his kindness that he sent his only-begotten Son to earth. Man was doomed for death, had been dying for 4,000 years before Jehovah’s Son came upon the scene. All who died remained in their graves, none having gone to heaven or to a ‘hell’ of ‘eternal torment,’ because “the dead know not any thing.” (Eccl. 9:5, 10) Sin entered the world by one man and death by sin, so that death passed upon all men. (Rom. 5:12) All under that condemnation have died. But now through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness man has an opportunity for life. Life is given to him by God, not by the things man possesses. We read: “He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.” (John 3:36, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> So then faith and obedience to the Word of the true God are his requirements. It must be faith that grows and fills your whole life, faith that takes you on to a greater understanding of Jehovah’s Word by a study of that Word, faith that moves you to keep on serving God with spirit and truth. (John 4:23; Gal. 6:8, 9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">Paul, quoting Jehovah’s own earlier utterance, wrote: “My righteous one will live by reason of faith. If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.” (Heb. 10:38; Hab. 2:4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">LXX)</span><span class="font4"> Christians are not the kind that shrink back. But even any of them who do shrink back are going into destruction along with this system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Study of God’s Word, searching of the Scriptures and observing the continuing fulfillment of God-given prophecy make one’s faith strong. “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld. For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.” (Heb. 11:1, 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> One with faith in God, with love for Him and for his neighbor, will prolong his days, because love puts away all covetousness. “He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.” (Prov. 28:16, AS) His right thinking, his proper use of accurate knowledge, bring life. “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—John 17:3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gaining of everlasting life depends on our knowledge, our continually taking in knowledge of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, Jehovah God, and of his Son, Christ Jesus. However, Satan, the god of this world, will always want us to think that life comes through possession of property, material things, rather than through right knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. (2 Cor. 4:3, 4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Life, to begin with, is because God is love and has shown it through undeserved kindness. He is not obliged to give us this life. It is his gift to all those who “serve him with a complete heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some think that all material prosperity they receive is due to God’s blessing upon them. But, as Paul declared, “the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things.” If you put money first because of what it can get you—ahead of the Word of God and what it surely will bring to you in the way of eternal life—you will be sidetracked; you will no longer be seeking first the interests of God’s kingdom. Jesus, explaining his own parable of the sower, said: “Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God. ... As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones that have heard, but, by being carried away by anxieties and wealth and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to perfection.” (Luke 8:11-15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Millions upon millions have heard the Word of God. They became very much interested in it, but only for a short period of time; for while they were studying this Word of God they were also being carried away by the anxieties and wealth and pleasures of this life. So, then, these individuals were completely choked. No sweet breath of truth could get to them, because of their anxieties. The seed of truth was completely crowded out of their lives. These had had the full opportunity of hearing the truth, but they were just carried away with the things of this world. They wanted that way; it was their own choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This can happen even to those who now have the truth. They can still be choked if the lifeline is cut. If we cease feeding upon the Word of God we can starve to death. Hence the question: Can you make yourself the right kind of soil on which this seed, the Word of God, falls? That is possible, for Jesus said: “As for that on the right soil, these are the ones that, after hearing the word with a right and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.” (Luke 8:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Yes, there must be a right and good heart. Our motive in life must be to advance the Kingdom interests, not selfish gains. We must be interested in righteousness, following out the command of Christ Jesus to preach this good news of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness. It means not just for a short time, as a kind of diversion or pastime—for a year or two; but to bear fruit means that we shall keep at it continually and let the fruit come on to maturity. It means endurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is this endurance as a Christian that has caused many people trouble. Not trouble that they could not endure, but trouble from the old world. Many who have learned Jehovah’s purposes think that now that they have come to an understanding of God’s Word and the New World, which they have prayed for, the New World should be established right away. Just as soon as they hear the truth, or perhaps a year or so afterward, they want all the blessings of that new world of righteousness. This is a kind of covetousness. They do not want to wait on Jehovah God until he is ready to establish it. By the way they live they show they are not sure that God’s time is worth waiting for. They are not willing to get into the race and endure to the end in order to receive the blessings of everlasting life. Then, on the other hand, we see those willing to endure all kinds of hardship, like Jehovah’s witnesses in Russia who have gone to concentration camps, labor camps, into Siberian exile. They do not turn back; they do not seek communism or the things of this world in place of the spiritual blessings that they receive from Jehovah God. They know that life does not result from the things that they possess in the way of this world’s material things. They hold fast to their integrity. Remaining true and loyal to Jehovah God they go through the suffering that comes their way because of their maintaining integrity. So it is with Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and many other parts of earth. Firmly these have stood under the greatest stress and pressure ever brought upon Christians to break their faith. They have been stripped bare of all their possessions. Husbands have been separated from their wives; families have been torn apart. Satan would like to break their faith, their integrity. He would like them to think that life comes through material things that they can possess. But Jehovah’s witnesses, in lands behind the “iron curtain” and in all other parts of the world, fully appreciate that life comes through the undeserved kindness of God and the provisions he now makes for them to keep on taking in knowledge of him, and their continuing to preach the good news of his established kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These faithful Christians who have gone through ordeals greater than the Catholic inquisition of centuries ago are not interested in saving their lives so that they might have the pleasures and comforts of this old world. They have read the words of Jesus: “For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it. For what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?” (Matt. 16:25, 26, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> In this world there are some persons who think more of one meal and the personal possession of that than of their own lives. So it was with Esau “who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn.” (Heb. 12:16; Gen. 25:34, NW) Jesus declared: “Really, what does a man benefit himself if he gains the whole world but loses his own self or suffers damage?”—Luke 9:25, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we pray the Lord’s prayer all we ask for is the bread for the day. With that the majority of earth’s people can be content; but just think of the contentment of one who has godly devotion with it! “To be sure, it is a means of great gain, this godly devotion along with self-sufficiency. For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out. So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” (1 Tim. 6:6-8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Today Christendom’s people do not love God’s Word, nor do they want to live according to its commandment. They choose to go on in their own selfish way, hurting themselves. Even if one of Jehovah’s witnesses becomes so wrapped up in the affairs of this world, his secular work, his possessions or the gathering together of them, eventually he could be sucked out of the New World society into that wicked organization doomed to destruction at Armageddon. Why? Because he tried to save his life in his own way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one loses sight of the undeserved kindness of Jehovah it is not very long before he stops meeting with God’s people. Maybe just by staying away from one meeting he can earn many more dollars and pay part of the mortgage or buy some new furniture or make a payment on a car. But which is worth more, the taking in of knowledge at the meetings and associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, or the earning of those few extra dollars at the expense of becoming more tired, so that even after those extra hours you cannot do any other kind of work in the service of Jehovah? Why should a man be working day and night, double shift, or why should his whole family be working double shift? They lose out on meeting and associating with God’s people, and at the same time their children are permitted to run the streets. Maybe they are getting the things they want materially; but if you are one of such persons pause and ask yourself: Am I getting happiness? (Matt. 5:3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Am I enjoying the things that I am getting, or am I losing the bigger things in life? Am I losing my husband (or wife), my family? More than that, am I losing the truth? Am I losing life itself? Am I losing God and his beloved Son? Am I losing the new world? Are you thus losing just to have a bigger television, a bigger car, bigger home, bigger bams? Are there things in your life that are pulling you away from true Christianity, genuine worship of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and the giving to him of your exclusive devotion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God knows our need of shelter, food, clothing—life’s necessities; but he knows too that we do not </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">need</span><span class="font4"> anything else. Look at what Adam had in the garden of Eden: Just a garden; no large mansion; not any of today’s “modern conveniences.” But Adam did have the opportunity to live eternally had he been faithful to Jehovah God. While “modern conveniences” can only momentarily lighten man’s burden, still even these things, rightly used, should enable us to put more time in Jehovah’s service, to magnify his name, and to allow us greater freedom to preach the good news of his kingdom. They should be timesavers rather than time consumers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Stop and think! you Christians, are you giving Jehovah God exclusive devotion? Are you speaking to your neighbors and friends, or people you have never met before, about the good things that you have learned concerning the undeserved kindness of God? Are you bringing tithes into his storehouse? That is, are you attending all the meetings, taking part in them? Are you helping with the expenses in your Kingdom Hall? Are you proving by your works that you really are living your dedication to Jehovah? Do you prove yourself to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses by your association with that great crowd of people, scattered throughout the earth, announcing Jehovah’s kingdom? Do you claim to be a minister of Jehovah God; and if so, then what about your ministerial service? Are you growing toward maturity? Are you gaining accurate knowledge of the truth? Are you able to explain the Word of God better to people as days go by? Are you bringing up your children in the nurture and discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah? Do you give them the attention that they need? Do you study with them? Do you play with them? Do you bring them to the meetings? Do you provide for them spiritually? Do they love you as children should love parents? Are you interested in having your boys and girls grow up to become missionaries? And are you, like many happy parents, rejoicing that your children have gone off into missionary service in foreign fields; and are you continuing to encourage them to stay in those fields to do the great work that Jesus said would be done in these last days in taking the good news of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth and there discipling all kinds of people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These questions Christians should ask themselves. They should be able to answer aright, not in words but in deed, in God’s sight—in their daily lives as proof of where their hearts are, because that is where their treasure will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Are you, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, doing what the psalmist said we should be doing in these last days: “From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him”? (Ps. 96: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Only Jehovah God can provide salvation for human creatures. Are you, as one dedicated to Jehovah’s service, spreading his good news of salvation that Jehovah has arranged for? Are you doing it from day to day? Are you telling all persons that you can about this good news? If you are, then you certainly are storing up treasures in heaven and you certainly know where your heart is. It is in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paul wanted everyone to see that he kept in the right course, and that is why he wrote: “I give you orders that you observe the commandment in a spotless and irreprehensible way until the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Tim. 6:13, 14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Remember, too, how he said some would be stabbing themselves all over with many pains, hurting themselves, being led astray from the faith. But to counteract this, so that they would not hurt themselves, Paul said: “On the other hand, you, O man of God, flee from these things. But pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, mildness of temper. Contend for victory in the right contest of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you declared the right confession publicly before many witnesses.” —1 Tim. 6:11, 12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Desiring to get a firm hold on the real life, we actually shall want to ‘stop storing up for ourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal.’ “Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”—Matt. 6:19-21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>“FEED MY LITTLE SHEEP”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Master was alive. The great Preacher of Jehovah’s kingdom was there on the seashore. Already Christ Jesus had built a fire and had fish broiling upon it; bread also there was for the disciples to break their fast. Peter, as usual, impulsive, had put on his garments (for he was naked) and had jumped off the boat and swum ashore. The others had rowed to shore in the small boat. To them Jesus spoke in the same manner that he had spoken before his resurrection. To those hungry disciples he said, “Come, take your breakfast.” Not one had courage or need to ask him, “Who are you?” They realized it was their Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise.” Prior to this postresurrection appearance of Christ Jesus there had been six others: among these, one to Mary Magdalene, then to the group of women, to the two on the way to Emmaus, and also to Peter. John reports: “This was now the third time that Jesus appeared [especially] to the disciples [to apostles in a group] after his being raised up from the dead.” Remember, “out of fear of the Jews the doors were locked where the disciples were, Jesus came and stood in their midst”; also “his disciples were again indoors, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and he stood in their midst.” (John 21:12-14; 20:19, 26, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Here now was ample evidence; alive again was the Redeemer of mankind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">John, vividly describing this breakfast scene, adds the impressive conversation between Jesus and Peter, which very indelibly remained on Peter’s mind. Jesus speaks directly to Simon Peter: “ ‘Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?’ He said to him, ‘Yes, Master, you know I have affection for you.’ ” When Jesus first propounded this question he may have had in mind what he had previously said to his disciples and Peter’s reply. That earlier conversation Mark reports: “Jesus said to them: ‘You will all be stumbled, because it is written, “I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered about” But after I have been raised up I will go ahead of you into Galilee.’ But Peter said to him: ‘Even if all the others are stumbled, yet I will not be.’ ” However, everyone in the world who since then has ever read the life of Christ knows how Peter three times denied Christ, and how truly Jesus prophesied when he said: “You today, yes, this night, before a cock crows twice, even you will disown me three times.” But then Peter had profusely retorted: “If I have to die with you, I will by no means disown you.” All the other disciples also then had said the same thing.—Mark 14: 27-31, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus was a marvelous teacher. Using illustrations, he also indelibly impressed the minds of his listeners with what he desired to get into their minds and into their very hearts. So Jesus, at the seaside breakfast, with Peter’s three denials in mind, continued talking directly to Peter, a second time asking: “Simon son of John, do you love me?” Peter replied: “Yes, Master, you know I have affection for you.” Jesus then said to him, “Shepherd my little sheep.” Then a third time Jesus (using now Peter’s own variant term </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">affection) </span><span class="font4">asked: “Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?” Grieved, Peter now insisted: “Master, you know all things; you are aware that I have affection for you.” Then Jesus said: “Feed my little sheep.” What an avalanche of thoughts must have hurtled through Peter’s mind while Jesus was talking to him, repeatedly asking him the same question and then three times telling him, ‘Feed my lambs; shepherd my little sheep; feed my little sheep’! Jehovah’s greatest Teacher knew that when he would shortly afterward permanently ascend into the heavens the whole load of responsibility would fall upon those who had followed him; he knew that they would be the overseers of his sheep. He realized they would be the ones responsible for seeing to it that all those who had begun to put faith in him as Jehovah’s anointed Leader, and in his new teaching, would have to be shepherded. Would he have trustworthy men— men that would never turn aside? He eagerly made sure that this one, Peter, would be diligent in his work. Each of the other six faithful disciples present at that seaside breakfast the Master (here using Peter as the example or “sounding board”) thus also instructed. Upon those other six also Jesus thus adroitly impressed the importance of their own individual responsibility as lovers of him, as his sheep’s loving tenders and feeders. So it was by repetition, by three true testimonies or “witnesses,” that Jesus emphasized the feeding and shepherding of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font4"> sheep.—John 21: 15-17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>“PRESIDE IN A RIGHT WAY”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Today, though removed by more than 1900 years from that sublime morning at Galilee’s shore, faithful Christians keenly sense its lesson as one they must vividly keep in mind. While each dedicated servant of Jehovah God bears a responsibility to preach the good news of His kingdom, they all, individually, also must recognize the organization, the grand, unified association, of these qualified ministers. They all must and do clearly visualize their now having been brought together into the congregation, the assembled earth-wide army or society of Jehovah’s new world! Indeed, they see among themselves Jehovah’s provision of qualified overseers, equipped to look after their welfare and to supervise their united, orderly, ever-expanding joyful activity in obedience to Jehovah and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the New World society the principal overseer in a local congregation is the congregation servant. Paul, the faithful twelfth apostle of the Lamb, was deeply interested in these servants too; hence he urged: “He that presides, let him do it in real earnest.” (Rom. 12:8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> To Timothy and to Titus Paul wrote detailed instructions for overseers and ministerial servants. He informed them how circumspectly they must walk. Naturally, men in the truth and acquainted with God’s Word the longest would be the ones to preside over the congregation because of their qualifications and faithfulness. That is why Paul admonished Timothy: “Let the older men who preside in a right way be reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.” (1 Tim. 5:17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Clearly Paul saw that the other faithful apostles who actually had walked with Jesus and had been personally taught by Jesus had been carefully chosen. Paul saw that it was necessary to be very selective in placing men in positions of responsibility. They must be men rich in right works—men who work hard in Kingdom service. There was no question about that. Older or experienced men, too, would be qualified to preside in the right way; to all other godly persons they would speak and they would teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Bible many scriptures indicate that true Christians should go from house to house; that they should make return visits; and that in the homes of the people they should help them to study the Bible. Truly, then, every individual who claims to be a genuine follower of Christ must be able to teach, even as Jesus, their Leader, taught— setting the pattern. But among all of these teachers there must necessarily be older or experienced men who can and will preside in Jehovah’s right way, exercising true leadership, setting the proper example for each less-experienced willing one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Peter was permanently impressed by the wise counsel Jesus gave him during that memorable breakfast session. Years later Peter wrote: “To the older men among you I give this exhortation, . . . Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not . . . as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.” (1 Pet. 5:1-3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Yes, Peter had been a fisherman. (Mark 1:17; Matt. 4:18-20, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> But now he had become, under Jesus’ patient and marvelous training, not a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mere</span><span class="font4"> ‘fisher of men’ but a truly godlike shepherd of sheeplike humans—not merely to ‘catch’ them (as fish are caught) but to tend and feed and rightly lead them on and on in righteous, life-sustaining ways of the Great Shepherd, Jehovah, for His name’s sake. (Ps. 23:3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Now, as a shepherd, a good one, Peter had become experienced in tending and feeding Christ’s young lambs and little sheep. To maturity he had brought many of them, as had done also Christ’s other faithful apostles. And now because Peter’s years were going by he was counseling the older men so that they too could clearly see their responsibility to act like true shepherds, properly looking after the flock, really being examples to the flock. Today, more than ever before, an overseer must be zealous. Why? Because today the zeal of Jehovah himself is being exercised in an outstanding way for advancement of his newly begun government in the hands of Christ Jesus. (Isa. 9:6, 7, AS) Today the zealous overseer must be equipped to teach. He must be able to give the proper instruction to others in the congregation so that they will become firmly established and remain faithful and true. He must lead others aright and he himself must continue joyfully following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>“PAY ATTENTION TO YOURSELVES”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Paul, an experienced overseer, entreated his brother overseers, saying: “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own [Son].” (Acts 20:28, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">Here, too, the emphasis is that an overseer must be a shepherd; he has a very responsible position. He must ‘feed my sheep.’ Today not only do overseers include those of individual congregations but there are overseers appointed to serve many congregations. According to the annual earth-wide report of activities of Jehovah’s witnesses (see country-by-country chart, pages 36 to 41), they are seen to be organized into 16,240 congregations. Under the Society’s arrangement, 1,107 circuit servants oversee those congregations. Still other experienced and trained men, district servants, oversee the circuit servants and congregation servants. Of these, 152 have been appointed to serve in different parts of the world. Today these appointed overseers—branch servants, zone servants, district servants, circuit servants, congregation servants —may not look upon their responsibilities lightly. —Ex. 18:25, 26; Deut. 1:9-15; Eph. 4:11-16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW; </span><span class="font4">Mic. 5:2-5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed such overseers may picture themselves at Galilee’s shore, where Peter once fished with his father and where, later, Peter attentively heard Jesus say to him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Feed my young lambs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Shepherd my little sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Feed my little sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here Jesus placed a full load of responsibility upon Peter, one of his appointed overseers, to do something very necessary. But were the other six chosen “fishers of men” who also at the same time heard Jesus’ weighty instruction to Peter—were those other six excluded? Did Jesus expect those other faithful apostles of his to do from then on whatever each of them privately and personally desired to do? Jesus’ own answer is clear: “You </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">continue</span><span class="font4"> following me.”—John 21:22; 17:15-21; Acts 1:6-8; Rev. 14:1-5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the united apostles’ work grew and more people who loved truth and righteousness were being gathered to this wonderful religion that Jehovah’s greatest Prophet, Jesus, had introduced, it called for many more mature men. More overseers would have to be appointed. And now, in this climactic harvesttime, especially, when we see associated with Jehovah’s New World society 591,556 ministers, all dedicated to Jehovah God, the need is a hundredfold greater. As these ministers are now gathered into thousands of local congregations with their qualified overseers and ministerial servants, all unitedly announcing Jehovah’s kingdom, every one of them must give to Jehovah God exclusive devotion. Those overseers by their deeds and works are reckoned worthy of double honor. Those within Jehovah’s organization “who work hard in speaking and teaching” are the ones who must and do “feed my little sheep.”—John 4:21-24; 1 Tim. 5:17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To everyone it should be clear that “if any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a right kind of work.” (1 Tim. 3:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">However, when he reaches out for such a position he should be sure he has qualifications to fulfill its requirements and to be a man who will bear the full responsibility that goes with that position. He must grow on to maturity. This may take years within the organization of the New World society. To qualify as an overseer, whether district servant, circuit servant, or similar supervisory task, he should be able first to fulfill the position of a pioneer or special pioneer, advancing then to the greater responsibilities in circuit and district service, or probably to duties of a branch servant overseeing Kingdom activities in an entire country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>QUALITY INCREASE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It brings real joy to the hearts of all ministers of God to see the wonderful work that has been accomplished in another year. One of the finest witnesses to the Kingdom ever given by Jehovah’s witnesses was performed during the service year 1956. Throughout the year the Society tried diligently to add more persons to the special pioneer work, to serve needy ones in isolated regions of earth, along with missionaries, and to preach there</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the good new of the established Kingdom. Special pioneers have increased by 519 over the previous year; 2,637 are now working in isolated territories, organizing new congregations and taking on the responsibility of overseeing when a local group gathers. In years of human life some of these special pioneers may be young, but as to other Christians in their midst they are older or experienced men, able to preside in a right way; and these new ministers who have dedicated themselves to God see that these special pioneers have worked hard in their speaking and in their teaching, and they are pleased to have their helpful shepherding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fine growth within the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses in the past twelve months is now apparent. In 162 lands throughout the world an average of 591,556 Kingdom publishers has been preaching every month. This is a 3.6-percent increase over the 1955 service year. While this numerical or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">quantity</span><span class="font4"> increase is not so great as in some other years, growth or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">quality</span><span class="font4"> increase within the association of brothers is very healthy, outstanding. Consciousness of the earth-wide forward movement of the united, peaceful New World society members is broadening and deepening among all of them. They see more clearly that their delightful work is a gathering in of the other sheep, which makes our hearts glad. One and a half million more hours were spent in joyful field activity during the past twelve months than during the previous year. That included gathering 136,000 more new subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> Not only do Jehovah’s witnesses go from house to house and preach short sermons to the people, interesting them in home Bible study, talking and reading to them directly from the Bible, but they try to leave with willing ones printed sermons so that after the Kingdom minister departs to serve someone else the householder visited may privately consider such sermon or several sermons of greater length. During the service year 19,326,817 books, booklets and Bibles have been placed. Additionally, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!—</span><span class="font4">the two principal journals Jehovah’s witnesses use in helping people in Bible study —were distributed to the number of 55,735,715 copies. Magazine distribution alone, from house to house and on street corners, has increased over 19,000,000 copies. Of course, there are many hundreds of thousands of subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> This required regular distribution, through the Society’s many branches and printing plants, of millions of copies of these publications. To supply the needs of Jehovah’s witnesses in more than a hundred languages the Society printed 130,992,362 Bibles, books, booklets and magazines, all of which assisted them in proclaiming world-wide the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>“TELL THE GOOD NEWS”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In all of this we rejoice. It truly makes our hearts glad to have had a share in spreading this comforting message unto the ends of the earth. Always Jehovah’s witnesses have in mind, in their work day by day, the words of Jesus: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> That is why they have chosen for this year a very energizing text, one filled with life and responsibility: “From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The New World society looks forward to 1957 with unusual vim, vigor and vitality, to tell this message of comfort to every willing listener in all the world. Last year God’s kingdom ministers spent 87,353,772 hours going from house to house preaching, telling people about the wonderful hope before them. Not only have they gone from house to house with sermons, but they made many, many a back-call. In fact, during the year they made 27,746,348 back-calls. Out of these they were able to establish 333,330 home Bible studies. What a joy it is to see ministers, not hired to stand on a pulpit but ministers at heart, going out to all the nations of the world and helping people there to see the truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses fully appreciate that there still are many things to be done, many places to be visited, many hearts to comfort. They know, too, that many more persons have to be helped to grow to maturity, to gain accurate knowledge and a clear understanding of the Bible. Last year at the Memorial service of Jehovah’s witnesses there were 919,994 persons in attendance. Only 16,302 of these professed to be of the anointed, striving for the position of being joint heirs with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory. All of the other hundreds of thousands are, we believe, eager to live here on earth in the new world of righteousness, according to the will of Jehovah. But they need help. Not all of these 919,994 are ministers—only 591,556 have identified themselves as such, and they have much work to do. For some reason they conducted 4,000 fewer Bible studies in the homes of the people than during the preceding year. Not quite as many of them went out in the preaching work during the year. There were only 640,347. But even though 2,582 fewer publishers report having worked sometime during the year, this does not disturb Jehovah’s witnesses. They are determined to take care of the other sheep. And having in mind the texts considered in this review, and having specially in mind Jesus’ words, “Feed my little sheep,” every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, not only overseers but every minister of every congregation, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness will put forth greater effort than ever before to tell this good news from day to day. Why will they do this? Because they see that some are not taking on the responsibility that was placed upon Peter. Such ones do not feel the seriousness of it. Therefore it will be necessary for all of Jehovah’s witnesses to call on more people, spend more time with those in the truth and those not yet in the truth, so that they might be brought on to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here is another interesting thing: During the past seven years 394,024 were baptized. Every one of these has declared himself before Jehovah God that he has chosen to do Jehovah’s will. Today His will is that His servants preach the good news of His kingdom. But when we go back in our reports seven years we find that at the end of the service year 1949 there were only 279,421 regular ministers in the field. Add that to those baptized during the past seven years and you have 673,445 people that should be publishers of the Kingdom. But the record shows that there are only 591,556 working ministers. Very easily the question can be asked: Where are the other 80,000? Have they died? No, not all of them; at least not physically. They are not in their graves. But some have become sick spiritually and they need the help of those who have come on to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remember what Jesus said: “Feed my little sheep.” The responsibility falls upon every one of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide to do that very thing. Are you doing it? Will you do it? Will the year 1957 be outstanding as far as you are concerned in doing the will of Jehovah God? Do you hear Jesus saying to you, “Feed my little sheep”? And will it bring real joy to your heart to have in mind and to live the text Jehovah’s witnesses will keep before them during 1957: “From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him”? Do you appreciate your responsibility as an overseer, as a ministerial servant, as a minister in the great congregation of God? Jesus’ words, “Feed my little sheep,” apply to you, the Christian.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark180"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WITH SPECIAL APPOINTMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">All of Jehovah’s witnesses have the responsibility before Jehovah to preach the good news of God’s kingdom in all the world for the purpose of a witness. As did the apostles in carrying on the preaching of the good news, so do Jehovah’s witnesses today, namely: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The apostles of Christ Jesus were so imbued with the message that not long after his death they were going throughout the territory and “every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5:42, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> In order for this work to be accomplished in the early days of Christianity certain ones were appointed to positions of special responsibility to take on supervision of the work. And so it is in these days among Jehovah’s witnesses. In order to carry out the command of Christ Jesus to preach this good news in all the world, in every part of the earth, for the purpose of a witness, it takes real organization and supervision. To that end the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has set up branches in seventy-eight countries of the earth and in these principal offices the Society has branch servants and many persons in such offices to assist the manager of the work. In addition to that, appointments are made of special representatives who go forth into the field to supervise the work. There are zone servants, district servants and circuit servants. These visit the congregations throughout the world, the district and circuit servants visiting the brothers twice a year to oversee the progress of the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are other special representatives in different parts of the earth with duties that they must perform in connection with supervi-sional activity. While the Society recognizes all of Jehovah’s witnesses who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah God as ordained ministers, we set out at this time just those who have special appointments, and who are serving in a special capacity in the supervisional direction of the Society. The following lists those persons who have been assigned to special duties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MINISTERS TRAINED FOR MISSIONARY WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From all parts of the world have come ministers who desire to be trained for missionary work at the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. This school of highest learning is located in New York State, near the city of Ithaca. In a beautiful location out in the country the students that are called are away from the hustle and bustle of the city and can really concentrate on Bible study. During the past service year the school graduated its twentysixth and twenty-seventh classes. This brought the total enrollment of the school, from February, 1943, up to the close of the 1956 service year, to 2,938. Of this number, only ninety-three have failed to complete the course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The school is no place for lazy people. For five and one-half months these well-trained ministers go through an intense study of the Bible and related subjects and also take up a language, so as to prepare themselves for a foreign assignment. While the school is located in the United States, this does not mean that only Americans are eligible. Jehovah’s witnesses have been called from fifty-eight different countries to attend Gilead School, and the Society has paid their fare to the school, taken care of them while there and sent them off into new missionary fields. Out of the number that have graduated thus far, 1,233 have come from outside the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The graduates of Gilead have done much to open up new territory in which to preach the good news of the Kingdom. In going over the year’s report it has been found that they are scattered in more than a hundred different countries, islands of the sea and colonies of the greater empires. It is our prayer that these faithful brothers and sisters will continue to help the other sheep in their foreign assignments and that the full-time ministry will always be their goal. Many of these graduates of school are now being used as district and circuit servants the world over, as well as being used as branch servants, but along with these added responsibilities it is their great joy always to go from house to house and “from day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.”—Ps. 96:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>THE TWENTY-SIXTH TERM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The twenty-sixth class of Gilead began its studies on September 7, 1955. One hundred and eight students enrolled and two were dropped, making a total of 106 present for graduation. It was a very interesting international class, persons being there from Canada, Burma, the Netherlands, Germany, Southern Rhodesia and Britain, as well as from the United States. A good many circuit servants and their wives were brought in from the United States and Canada to receive special training to equip them better for their service in that field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">February 12, 1956, was their big day, graduation day! There was an attendance of 2,796 at the graduation program. At that time the president of the Society as well as of the school addressed the great audience on the subject &quot;Christians Must Be Happy.” The instructors, along with the servant in charge of Kingdom Farm, which is associated with the school, gave short talks. One hundred and two of those graduating received diplomas. Four others were not able to meet the high requirements set by the school in order to receive a diploma, but these were sent forth to enjoy special privileges of service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TWENTY-SEVENTH TERM</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font3">The twenty-seventh class also included a special group of circuit servants and their wives. These were taught advanced English instead of a foreign language, as they were going to return to their former assignments. In addition to these, many ministers were called from the field, and those going forth into the missionary service studied Spanish, French and Arabic. On February 22, 1956, this term opened with an enrollment of 109 students. There were thirty-five non-Americans there, coming from Belgium, Canada, Lebanon, Trinidad and the Gold Coast in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A very happy time was had by those who attended the graduation sessions on July 28 and 29. This was the first summer graduation to be held at the school’s campus since 1952, as during the following years the graduations of Gilead School in the summer were held in connection with assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses. By Sunday morning, when the graduation took place, there were 4,420 in attendance. On Saturday 2,634 were there</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for fellowship and assembling together. All the members of the faculty spoke and also President Knorr. The key address was on the subject “Irreprehensible Witnesses.” It was pointed out that when missionaries go off into the foreign field they should make up their minds to stay there, and their relatives back home should give encouragement to their children, who are now young men and women, to remain in their foreign assignments. Missionary work is not just for the period of a few years, but it is a lifetime work. All the students graduating, namely, 108, unanimously adopted a resolution, which they entitled “An Expression of Gratitude.” It was a delightful day and one that made everyone rejoice that Jehovah’s rich blessing has been upon the school for so many years. When one reflects he can see the good work that the missionaries have done, and it is hoped that those of the twenty-seventh class will do as well.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>THE NEW WORLD SOCIETY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses have come from every nation, kindred and tongue into a new-world society. They come from every religion in the world, from all walks of life, and have now set their course as Christians. They fully appreciate that a Christian will proclaim the name of Jehovah God and His Son, Christ Jesus, and make known Jehovah’s glorious kingdom unto the ends of the earth. They are careful students of the Bible and use it as their principal textbook, and they want to know more about Jehovah’s purposes, because the Bible itself says that all the things written in the Bible were written aforetime for our learning, upon whom the end of this system of things has come. Jehovah’s witnesses believe that they are living in the last days of this system of things and that they must make known God’s message far and wide and give the peoples of the earth the opportunity of taking their stand on the side of the Kingdom and against this wicked system of things. They fully appreciate, too, that everyone should learn about Jehovah, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, and therefore they have in mind the words of the psalmist: “That they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83:18, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses work together as one organization world-wide. It makes no difference into which language or nationality they may have been born. They are all one people. Therefore they could not have a national church, or a religious system in one country that was in opposition to a religious system in another country. One congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses could not engage in strife against another congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. If they have one God, and one mediator, Christ Jesus, then they must have one faith too, and they must live by one standard. All, regardless of where they reside in the world, appreciate that one standard of life is set forth in Jehovah’s Word, the Bible. So the Bible becomes their textbook world-wide, regardless of the language in which it is printed, for the truth is found in all translations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question arises, What keeps Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts as one New World society? The answer is simple: it is the spirit of God. The answer is so simple that few outside the organization can comprehend it or believe it, but when once a person leaves the Devil’s organization and associates himself with Jehovah’s witnesses he soon learns that the spirit among Jehovah’s witnesses is different. He finds out that this spirit is Jehovah’s spirit operating upon them to do a great work of proclaiming this good news of the Kingdom in all the world for the purpose of a witness unto all nations, and then the end will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses realize that when Jesus came to earth he began gathering out from all nations, kindreds and tongues a little flock to be joint heirs with him in heavenly glory. That little flock is numbered as 144,000, according to Revelation the seventh and fourteenth chapters, and we have every reason to believe that there are a few of that group of 144,000 that are living upon the earth awaiting their glorious change to be associated with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory and to rule and reign with him for a thousand years. This small body, or remaining number, is called the remnant. These anointed of Jehovah are being used by him as a faithful and discreet slave class today to guide and direct the affairs of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide. These faithful servants of God many years ago started different organizations, principally the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. This corporation in America is dedicated to the purpose of preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere co-operate with this Society. There are many other societies throughout the world that are used by Jehovah’s witnesses as their legal agents to carry on the work in different countries and in different communities, such as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., and the International Bible Students Association of Canada and of England and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of West Germany. There are different names for the Society in Cuba, Brazil and other parts of the world. But these societies are only agents of Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on their work and make it easy for them to operate in the different localities of the earth. But as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned, they are an unincorporated body, all God’s servants, his ministers, ordained to preach this good news of the Kingdom. Everywhere throughout the world they co-operate one with the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will always find that Jehovah’s witnesses are eager to know what Jehovah’s purposes are. They are diligent Bible students and they stick together in their congregations and meet with one another regularly in congregational meetings, such as the theocratic ministry school, the service meeting and the study of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. Thus they take their service to God seriously. There are some people in the earth that say they are Jehovah’s witnesses, but you do not find them carrying on the afore-mentioned practices of attending the various meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses, nor associating with them. They may believe as Jehovah’s witnesses do, but they have not taken on the responsibility that Jehovah God really places upon his New World society. But those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah God through dedication and who have been baptized in water, symbolizing that dedication, are of one mind and spirit and they study the one Word of God. This keeps them all together and in unity with the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses, the New World society, being scattered all over the earth, are directed through seventy-eight branches. We find them today in 160 different countries. Through the different corporations that they have established in various parts of the earth they have built up printing plants to print publications in languages suitable for the people of their community. Their principal instrument is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine, which is published in forty-six different languages and has reached a circulation of nearly 3,000,000 copies of each printing. The members of the New World society look to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to bring them the food necessary for sustaining life. They fully appreciate that life does not come from the material blessings of the world, but only through the study of Jehovah God’s Word. They fully appreciate, too, the words of Jesus at John 17:3 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font4">: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” In the prayer of Jesus when with his disciples in the upper room at the time of the passover, and when he introduced the memorial of his own death, he said: “Also I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I am coming to you. Holy Father, watch over them out of respect for your own name which you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are.” (John 17:11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> So today we find that Jehovah God is protecting his people and pouring upon them his spirit through his Son, Christ Jesus, and he has kept them as one people, the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Their great desire in life is to be taught by Jehovah God himself and to walk in the path that he has set for them. This is well expressed by the prophet Isaiah in the third verse of the second chapter of the book bearing his name. This they have been doing and they can prove that they have been doing it by the report that follows from all the branches in the world. Once a year the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society publishes the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font4"> which sets out the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere delight to review the blessing of Jehovah upon their service, and they look forward to a new year with joy and gladness, confidently expecting a like blessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Another year of intensive witnessing was carried on in the United States. In examining the report we find there were 5,960 more publishers working every month than during the previous year. While this is a good increase the expansion is not so great as the previous year, when there were 9,906. It is good to see more of the other sheep coming into Jehovah’s organization, even though it is not so rapid. However, we are concerned as to why the increase is not so rapid. In the year 1955 there were 13,910 persons baptized and in the year 1956,18,968 persons were baptized. One would think that with this great increase in the number of those baptized the increase in the field would be greater. However, there was only a four-percent increase in the United States in publishers. It is believed that the district, circuit and congregation servants, those who hold positions of responsibility, will examine this point very carefully during the year 1957, to see what they can do to help those who are weak and to make them strong and to gather the other sheep in as rapidly as possible before the final battle of Armageddon. It must be remembered that those who have much will have more required of them, and certainly the appointed servants have a great responsibility resting upon them. This is something that gives every one of us real concern. We find an increase in the number of publishers that totals 15,866 in two years’ time, whereas the number baptized was 32,878. Here is a challenge to every one of Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States to aid those who are dedicated to Jehovah God to continue on in the service. At the same time they must continue to gather the new ones into the organization. The whole report for the United States’ branch is most encouraging. There has been a splendid increase in the number of hours spent in the field witnessing, in new subscriptions obtained and especially in the number of individual magazines distributed. When it comes to back-calls, home Bible studies and public meetings we find more fine increases, but the results of this good increase should have reflected themselves, we believe, in more increases in the number of publishers serving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The question must be asked, not only in the United States, but in many other countries throughout the world, After we have aided persons to come into the organization and have helped them to see their responsibilities and to be baptized, do we neglect the bringing of them on to maturity? If this is a reason for the no greater increase than four percent, then certainly in 1957 this failing should be corrected and we should aid those who have already come into the organization, to see that they stand firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An outstanding point during the year was that the congregation publishers averaged 10.7 magazines, going well over the quota of nine per publisher per month. The branch office report sets out some very interesting experiences and figures on production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And how did this increase of magazine distribution come about? By more publishers sharing in Magazine Day activity, prestudy service and the placing of magazines with householders who do not accept the monthly offer. One publisher averaged between twenty and twenty-eight magazines a month during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign by offering single issues when the subscription offer was not taken. When May came with the new offer it never occurred to him to continue offering magazines after making the regular offer until he saw the suggestion in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> By his putting this suggestion into practice his magazine placements now continue to remain well over the quota. Many pioneers and publishers have informed us of the good results they are having by being magazine-conscious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many more congregations this year supported special magazine activity on old-world holidays, such as &quot;Thanksgiving” and “Christmas.” Reports indicate that placements everywhere were outstanding and everyone who engaged in field service on those days looks forward to doing so again. One car group of six placed 255 magazines on “Christmas Day.” In the group were two young ministers, aged 12 and 13, fleshly cousins. These brothers really put Kingdom interests first to engage in the ministry. Why so? The father of one had invited them to spend time with him visiting in a large nearby city, but they declined, choosing instead to remain and do Kingdom service. Both had wonderful experiences, with one placing fifty-nine magazines. Afterward they wrote the father of their experiences. He replied: ‘I was disappointed because you did not come, but after I see and understand, I love you both all the more for it. It makes me happy to see you two boys doing Jehovah’s work and keeping it before anything else. I love you very much, but cannot give you life as God’s Word can, so keep it up. When I come home I am going to go with you and do God’s work. I can see I have been missing a great deal of happiness. You boys have helped me more than you know.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Loving the truth, Jehovah’s witnesses are ready and desirous always of telling others of their hope. A newly associated couple were called on by a worldly magazine salesman. He had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses and was amazed to hear that they went from house to house giving Bible sermons and placing literature without profit. He asked if he could step in and hear a sermon. This was done, and then many of his questions were answered. He liked what he heard and asked if some witnesses would call on him and his family. In summary, the couple report: ‘The tables were turned! We “sold” him on everlasting life, instead of his selling us </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> magazine.’ Out-of-season witnessing does produce good fruitage, and that is why all of us should be alert to such opportunities and use them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To show the blessings that come from following through on placements, last November a sister obtained a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscription from a neighbor. The next week a back-call was made and soon a home Bible study was in progress. After one month of study the neighbor and his wife attended the congregation book study and soon after the man began publishing. He was immersed three months after the first contact and now, a year later, he is planning to sell his ranch so he can be free to preach. What blessings this publisher would have missed if she had not heeded Jesus’ command to “feed my young lambs”! We are happy to report that our total back-calls are up 400,000 over last year and, on the average, our home Bible studies are up about 8,000 a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While serving isolated interest a circuit servant was invited to give a talk in a Baptist church. Twenty-two persons attended and enjoyed the talk. At the conclusion of the talk the ‘pastor<sup>1</sup> told the congregation that the talk they had heard was all true, inasmuch as it was fully supported by the Scriptures, A home Bible study was started with the ‘pastor.’ Many false doctrines, such as tithes, trinity, etc., were soon cleared up. And what did the ‘pastor’ do on learning new Bible truths? He told the members of his church he was teaching them error, asked their forgiveness, and then taught them the true Bible instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Witnesses in America have gone ahead with their great witnessing campaign, but with nationwide difficulties. In sixteen towns, in twelve different states, Jehovah’s witnesses have been interfered with in their preaching activities under peddling ordinances. The Green River law was used to interfere in many other towns and states. In almost all instances threatened interference was pushed back by the brothers. They presented Supreme Court decisions, and the Legal Office in Brooklyn wrote directly to the city officials. The brothers in America follow instructions on handling interference set forth in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News.</span><span class="font3"> But many cases had to be fought throughout the country to keep the door open for house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In numerous cities objections have been raised when Jehovah’s witnesses request permits to build their own Kingdom Halls. Many of these new Kingdom Halls, which are beautiful and enhance the value of the adjoining land and improve the neighborhood, are being constructed in the United States. But haters of Jehovah’s witnesses oppose the new buildings. Local courts had to compel some cities to issue building permits so progress could be made on the construction of meeting places of Jehovah’s witnesses. Several cases are pending on appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many brothers in America have taken a firm stand in their Scriptural objection to participating in the national defense effort. At the close of the year fifty-seven of our brothers were serving long prison terms because of refusing to do alternate civilian work outside the army in furtherance of the national defense. They have already beaten their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks and are determined to keep it that way. The brothers in America have resolutely determined, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, to keep on preaching the good news of the Kingdom and not turn aside because of any obstacle raised by Satan. They are faithfully following the commands of Jehovah to proclaim the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One very important feature of field activity that has been on the decline for some years is the pioneer activity. We are very much pleased to report now that for the first time in four years we have gained in the number of regular pioneers. As for vacation pioneers, last year there were 2.708, while this year we enjoyed a new all-time peak of 5,809. It is good to see that many of the brothers and sisters, young and old and from all walks of life, are taking to heart the good admonition received at the circuit and district assemblies, through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font3"> and are thereby making all the necessary adjustments to enter into the pioneer service. We hope that in the coming year many more of the publishers will be encouraged to make room in their lives for this grand treasure of full-time service. Speaking of good admonition, we should like to take this occasion to express appreciation to Jehovah for the new provision of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font3"> Many servants and publishers have written in to the Brooklyn office expressing their appreciation of it, feeling it was just what was needed to spur them on to greater work during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the foregoing report it is very noticeable that magazine distribution has excelled in field ministry activity. But Jehovah has not only blessed the rapidly increasing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distribution</span><span class="font3"> of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!; </span><span class="font3">he has also provided for greatly enlarged publishing facilities. Last year we were able to report for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> that the foundation had been poured for a new publishing factory in Brooklyn, just across the street from our present one. Now it is our pleasure to report that on this foundation a sturdy thirteen-story building has grown to its full size and completion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The magazine office and the mailing department were moved into the top four floors. It was a joyous occasion, particularly to hear those who have been members of the Bethel family for many years express their heartfelt joy to Jehovah, for they have seen the Brooklyn factory grow from a small two-story to a thirteen-story plant. Jehovah has declared that this good news of the Kingdom must be preached in all the world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in forty-seven languages and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">in fifteen languages are very effectively doing this. Let us all, therefore, increase our use of them in our Kingdom ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Until some of the six new high-speed magazine rotary printing presses, which are now on order, are received and installed in “The Watchtower Building,” we shall be happy to continue working extra hours on our present printing presses to meet the increased demand. So that you might get a view of what has been accomplished at the Brooklyn factory over the past three years the following chart has been compiled.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There will be noted a decrease in books and booklets. However, because 1956 was truly a magazine year, the increase in volume of magazine printing greatly exceeded the decrease in the books and booklets. This is borne out by the fact that 118 more tons of paper were used this year than the former year; the grand total of paper consumption for the past year was 5,502 tons. For this paper to convey Jehovah’s word of life to searching eyes it required the making and using of eighty-eight tons of ink. And how far-reaching has this printed word been ? World-wide, for at the Brooklyn factory we have had the opportunity this past year of publishing literature in forty-nine different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been a wonderful privilege this past year for the 458 members of the Brooklyn Bethel family, as we have brought all our treasures into Jehovah’s storehouse by serving our brothers in all parts of the world. Now being entrusted by Jehovah with greatly enlarged publishing facilities in Brooklyn we all eagerly look forward to the coming year. It is our desire to use efficiently all of these good things from our heavenly Father to praise and honor him and to serve better all of you united with us in the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark194"></a><span class="font4">Where territories, countries, islands or isolated populated areas are not assigned to any particular branch, then the Brooklyn branch office looks after those territories until such time as they are assigned to a specific branch in the locality. It is a real encouragement to see the advance of Kingdom interests in some of these new places where we are trying to increase the witness work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The 1956 service year has been one full of blessings for the Alaskan witnesses. Generally the year starts off with an assembly. This year, however, we had two in succession, one for the northern part of Alaska, the other for the southeastern part. This enabled more to attend, because of shorter distances to travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then to add to our blessings the court trial of the Green River case in Anchorage came at the same time as the Anchorage assembly, so we were privileged to have Brother Covington with us. Jehovah gave us the victory in this case, as has been reported in the August 22 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> One hundred and twenty attended the main talk in Anchorage and five were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conventioners were thrilled to hear the experience of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> young Jewish soldier, who had just taken a firm stand for the truth. He started out by questioning the witnesses to disprove their beliefs, as he had always been able to disprove the beliefs of the various churches. His main point of attack had always been the trinity and the fact that we didn’t believe in it removed his main argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, he came to the point where he had to make </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> choice, so one evening he told the witnesses: “Either I don’t come back, or I come back as one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” He concluded his experience with: “You see me here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Shortly after these assemblies instructions were received to make preparations for an assembly in Fairbanks in May, which would be served by Brothers Knorr and Adams. This assembly was reported in the September 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> It was by far the largest and best we have had, with an attendance of 231 at the peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At one small Indian community the lone publisher was told by the city council to stop witnessing. A new ordinance was being drawn up forbidding peddling at the homes. One day later the two traveling representatives of the Society visited this sister and were told of this ordinance. Immediately, they visited the mayor and requested to see a copy of the ordinance. They were informed that the only copy had been sent to Juneau for final approval, and in the meantime the witness had been requested to stop her work. The mayor was informed that we could not comply with the request, that under the constitution we had freedom of religion, our work was not commercial and, further, the Supreme Court had ruled such a law unconstitutional. We proceeded with our preaching activity unmolested, after leaving the mayor a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Good progress in preaching the Kingdom message is being made in the group of islands that make up Bermuda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tourism is the lifeblood of Bermuda. This prosperous business is now threatened by the rising population, which has now reached a high of approximately 45,000. As there are only twenty square miles of these islands poking up through the Atlantic it means there is a density of 2,250 persons to a square mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Materialism, that insidious evil, has for long been a handy weapon in the adversary’s arsenal here, so we have appreciated the timely warnings given about it during the year. This is a rich man’s paradise and great are the crumbs that fall from the rich man’s table. What the rich man has the poorer one must strive after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our April assembly was noteworthy in that, for the first time, we had a program identical with the circuit assemblies held in the United States and other countries. It was ably presented by the few available brothers. Another improvement on former activity was our showing for the second time “The New World Society in Action.” This time we canvassed youth clubs, workmen’s clubs, parent-teacher associations and social organizations. The response was good and a much better coverage and attendance were obtained than at the first showing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day while engaged in his secular work a brother called at the home of one of the leading businessmen of the island. He passed a comment about the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity,</span><span class="font3"> which was lying on a kitchen counter, without at first disclosing he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The housekeeper, who had obtained the literature, enthusiastically told how she had been visited by two boys who preached a sermon and read her scriptures from the Bible. She had been reading a portion of the booklet every morning and had grasped and appreciated the difference between Christendom and Christianity. In answer to her questions the brother was able to outline the progress of the work in Bermuda for her. She thought the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses had ceased in Bermuda when, some years ago, two missionaries had to leave and the claim was made by some unenlightened people that they were Communists. However, her sister visited New York at the time of the 1953 assembly and told her she saw Jehovah’s witnesses “on all the street corners.” This lady commented: “Now how could they be Communists and stand on all the street corners?” This experience well illustrates the help we get from the activity of and the publicity given to our brothers in the United States and other countries. The leading newspapers and magazines of North America and Britain are available here, so the greater the publicity given the work there, the more it helps us here.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The religious leaders accused the circuit servant for Bangui of being a magician and having introduced magic into the Belgian Congo. They said that all who follow the religion of Jehovah’s witnesses attach themselves to witchcraft. When the religious leaders saw that telling lies was not sufficient to gain members for their churches, they hired an African and gave him a car so he could go around the region of Kemo-Gribingui and spread these lies, in order to prevent the people of good will from studying the Bible. A complaint of libel was brought against this person and a trial was held on May 3. Many persons were present for the hearing and a report states: “The judge examined and he saw that Jehovah is a God, not a sorcerer; therefore, he sentenced Fongo to two months in prison and to pay a fine.” So, despite the false charges by religious opposers, the work is not impeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The big event of the year was the sending of two European representatives into French Equatorial Africa (A.E.F.) to oversee the work there. Representations are being made to the government to get the work recognized in A.E.F. and to have the restrictions on the circulation of the Society’s Bible study aids lifted. The officials know the need for qualified European oversight of the work, as it works to the advantage of the government and makes for an orderly arrangement of things. The French brothers have already had a few months to work with the brothers in Brazzaville and Bangui and have been able to give them valuable aid in the ministry and in congregational organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On October 21 to 23, 1955, a circuit assembly was held in Brazzaville. This was the first time an assembly of this size was arranged and it was doubtful just what the official reaction would be. More than 3,000 persons attended the sessions and numerous experiences were related. One man said: “Will you give me the name and address where you study this good news? I never heard about this good news in my religion, where only evil reigns.” Another said: “It is the first time I have seen anything like this; these people are on the right road.” One passer-by remarked about the prosperity of Jehovah’s people and said: “The cause of the clergy is pitiful. If they don’t make an effort to improve their creeds, all the faithful ones will go to worship Jehovah.” One person was heard to say of a former opposer: “This man who chased the witnesses has now become a witness. These people amaze us. Those who chase them become interested.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>GUAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">We lost over thirty-three publishers in the past few months, over half of our congregation, when a few construction companies left Guam. There is a potential of permanent good-will persons that, we hope, will soon fill the vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are happy to report that at least two ministers matured enough in the Guam congregation to enter into the full-time service, but they are now pioneering in their native lands. They are having many privileges in helping the precious ones of all the nations to enter into the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are a few objections typical of Guam that we have not been able to overcome. A common trait of the people is to depart through the back door when they see us coming, or refuse to answer the door, or to acknowledge our visit, even though they may be sitting in plain sight. Another peculiar thing that happens frequently is that a publisher can be talking to four or five persons in a room and they will leave one by one without excusing themselves or saying they are not interested, until the publisher is sitting there all by himself. Of course, this action is mainly because of fear of the priests, who have not taught them to have love. If we can contact them at the right time and in the right mood they will talk and show good interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An interesting study is being held with a native sheep who is breaking away from false religion and the fear barrier, although her father-in-law is opposing her. When he found her studying with Jehovah’s witnesses he hurled all kinds of epithets at us and threatened to break our necks. He forced her to go to the monsignor, which she did, bringing her Catholic Bible with her. As usual all the monsignor did was villify Jehovah’s people and certainly did not refute the precious truths she had learned. The monsignor could not even find the Ten Commandments in the Catholic Bible, and our new sheep showed him where they were and what they say about idol worship. This call boomeranged on the father-in-law, as he found out in the short time his daughter-in-law had studied she could use the Bible and knew it better than the monsignor. Up to now she is making good progress and seems definitely to be one of the other sheep of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the service year just closed a definite step toward greater spiritual maturity has been evident among the small group of Kingdom publishers in Iceland. The only congregation on this northern island, located in the capital of Reykjavik, now has ten Publisher’s Record cards on file, all publishers, with only one exception, being native Icelanders. In April the three pioneers from other lands, who have now been many years in Iceland, were happy to welcome to their midst another pioneer from Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further evidence of this theocratic expansion was forthcoming when seven took the vital step of symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One sister made the 1,300-mile journey in July to attend the Danish district assembly in Arhus. This experience has greatly strengthened this sister, and only serves to emphasize how necessary it is for publishers living in such isolated fields to attend assemblies in other lands. Her initiative in doing so has stirred up others to consider such privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We were all happy to receive the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font3"> in Icelandic in time to release it at our Memorial celebration, when twenty were in attendance. This booklet is also doing a good work among the Icelanders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we look back over the past year we realize that the publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom in Iceland have never been so mature in the truth as they are now. Though few in number, they have reached out toward the high standard of New World living, and more than that, they have produced works in Kingdom preaching to back up their claim of being true worshipers of Jehovah God. We pray that by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they may continue to prove him, so as to receive further outpourings of blessing from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To reach this point thus far has taken many years of hard work. It has demanded of us pioneers much faith, love and unending patience. But we are happy to serve under Jehovah’s direction and we look to him to bless the Kingdom work in Iceland during the coming years, so that his name may receive the praise due to it in this island of the North Atlantic.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark201"></a>ISRAEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The year opened on an enthusiastic pitch, with the echoes of the Triumphant Kingdom assemblies’ wonderful events, as reported by the returning representatives. Then early in the year arrangements were made by the Society to move the missionaries from Jerusalem to Haifa, a more central location, to care for the work better throughout Israel. Haifa had two publishers reporting in September, with no meetings. Twelve attended the first meeting arranged, this growing to eighteen and even twenty, which more than filled the available room. It was a joy to watch the chart steadily grow, with the formation of the first congregation in Israel finally in June. August showed nineteen reporting and prospects for more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two weeks after the move to Haifa the branch servant from Cyprus visited Israel and a three-day assembly along the theme of the European assemblies was arranged. It being in the rainy season, a cafe with kitchen facilities for a cafeteria was rented for the gathering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In June arrangements were made for another assembly. The brothers not having much of this world’s goods, a shelter of reeds was put up in the yard of a brother and a cafeteria was also arranged. Haifa is the only Jewish city in Israel with Saturday bus service, which was a help to us, because the assembly was out from the center of the city. The blue Mediterranean in view beyond the speaker and Mount Carmel towering behind the listeners made a nice setting, while the talks brought out how modern Baal worship must be destroyed in the minds of the people. Fifty-one in all attended, with forty-one as a peak for one session; but the greatest joy was seeing twenty-two go out in the house-to-house work on Sunday morning, a number for their first time. As the assembly came to a close some expressed the wish that we could go right on fellowshiping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the increase is not big in numbers, to compare with some places, and there was a decrease last year, a hundred-percent increase over last year’s peak was encouraging. It is an overflowing bounty and now presents the challenge of maturing these, only possible by diligent effort on the part of each one, guided by Jehovah’s spirit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>OTHER ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In October there was a circuit assembly in St. Thomas and by arrangement with the Puerto Rican branch the “Light” was used to transport many friends from outlying places to the assembly city, Charlotte Amalie. Forty-six persons in all were thus able to attend to back up the local congregation. Following the assembly the brothers were taken back to their home territories and the boat proceeded to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for some repairs and refueling. At the same time a thousand pounds of clothing were loaded—garments of all kinds —gifts from the congregations of Puerto Rico. These were for the hurricane-battered people of Carriacou. We were anxious to unload the cargo of clothing, because our space was so cramped. Imagine the surprise of the Carriacou population when they learned of the good will of the Puerto Rican friends. It was six weeks after the storm. Homes were gone, food and clothing were gone and a number of lives were lost. Here was our boat supplying at least some of the needs of the people. The customs men too appreciated our help. All the clothing was put on the dock along with thirty pounds of dried milk and other canned foodstuffs, some of which was sent by the brothers at Guadeloupe. Customs officers quickly passed the gifts as free of duty, because they were hurricane relief, and in a couple of days the distribution was completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A few days later a brother went to the administrator to get permission to show the film. After a long witness it was learned that the priest had been to the administrator and had made efforts to prevent the landing of the relief supplies, saying: “It makes it look as though the church is doing nothing for the people.” He could not give permission, but application would have to be made to the chief of police in Grenada. This was done and the film was censored by a very appreciative censorship board, who gladly gave consent to show it anywhere in the Presidency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Showing the film in Carriacou had its problems, there being no power supply. If we were to show the film at all there was only one way to do it. Anchoring the boat securely near the shore we tied the stern to a tree on the beach. Then by running a two-hundred foot cable out to the shore from the ship’s power supply we could provide power for the projector. Some poles were put up on land nearby and a screen was erected. Only one more problem remained. How would we take care of the current between changes of the rolls of film? An electric iron and the ship’s searchlight were wired in, and by switching from one to the other, the projector to the other gadgets, the problem was overcome. This arrangement was made in several places. In Harveyvale about one thousand saw the film in two showings; and in the capital, Hillsboro, eight hundred attended. Appreciative remarks were numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In early January a heavy sea-swell came up and battered the shore for a couple of days and one of the local schooners was in danger of being washed ashore and wrecked. No one was on board and the only way to get aboard was from another boat. It was the only way to save her. The services of the Light were asked for and out she went in the rough sea with the schooner’s crew on board. It was a four-mile journey from our anchorage. When about a hundred yards away the men rowed out from the Light with a rope to the stricken vessel. We stood by while the dragging anchor was lifted, the sails were hoisted and the ship sailed to safety. Two hundred people watched from Hillsboro. It was a great witness, this time actions speaking louder than words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The missionaries report that fourteen islands were witnessed to during the year: Tortola, St. Martin, Saba, St. Eustatius, Marie Galante, Desirade, Bequia, Can-nouan, Mayero, Union, Carriacou, St. John, some in Puerto Rico and Grenada.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>TANGIER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to 1955 Tangier was untouched by Jehovah’s witnesses. Here was a large cosmopolitan city at the gateway to Morocco without one Kingdom announcer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A special pioneer writes: “When my companion and I arrived in this country we found that many persons spoke French here in Tangier. In spite of our poor French we spoke with them as well, although many did not either listen to or understand us. One day we visited a group of houses belonging to the French customs officials and their families, and we met a lady who was very kind to us, even though she probably understood but little. She took some publications in French. For some time we visited her, although she showed little advancement. So we left this lady for a while. Later we returned to see her and she was very happy to see us, so we immediately began a study in the French </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font3"> Her husband disliked us at first, that is, he did not like us visiting his wife. One day we managed to speak seriously with him and since then he has been studying along with his wife. He continues to show good will. Today this lady is a good publisher and symbolized her dedication this summer at an outdoor baptism. Maybe her husband will do the same later. The lesson here is: ‘Patience, brothers.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From a missionary comes this experience: “On the first call I placed a booklet with a young lady. On the back-call nothing had been read. She was always just going or just coming or ‘just doing something.’ As the husband was never in when we called all the discussion had to be conducted on the doorstep. However, we never made much progress. Then one evening very late we called and found both husband and wife at home. A long discussion on the Bible ensued and we finally managed to place the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’. </span><span class="font3">The husband concluded by saying that it was all very interesting but that he would ‘let us know when to call again.’ Two weeks passed; a month, and nothing happened. So we returned again one evening. A further long discussion ensued, in which the importance of a home Bible study was stressed. A study was arranged for the following week. The lady began the study on her own. At the close we just mentioned the regular study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in passing. The following Sunday she was in attendance. At the meeting she heard service arrangements announced, and on Magazine Day, on the way to group contact point, the missionaries were hailed by this young good-will person from the steps of her home. She had been waiting, with Bible in hand, for us to pass. She came to every group effort for several weeks. Just before the close of the service year she was baptized, along with three others, in the Atlantic Ocean. Another member of the New World society in Morocco!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Interesting to report are various studies with different types of persons, indeed “all kinds of men.” The UNESCO agent in Tangier, who studies regularly with the missionaries and attends some meetings, is beginning to see the failure of the United Nations and the concrete hope of peace with the real United Nation; the weekly visits to an Italian piano teacher; the Bible study with a Russian mathematics instructor; the steady progress being made by a Spanish lady farm owner; two natural sisters of Hungarian origin, whose profession is clinical but whose vocation is now preaching, who were baptized this summer—all these help to swell the growing crowd of good-will persons in this city.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The political situation in Argentina at the beginning of the Society’s service year was not very good. There were uprisings against the government that was in power. Finally, on September 16, 1955, the revolution came that put the dictator who exercised absolute authority and control of the country out of his office. Immediately the country came into a state of siege and everything came under police control. A reorganization had to take place. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, could not sit on the side lines and watch the goings on. They had business to take care of, their Father’s business; so they continued to preach the good news through all of this time of trouble. As the year comes to a close our brothers in Argentina can say: “I will give thee thanks with my whole heart: ... I will worship toward thy holy temple, and give thanks unto thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth.” (Ps. 138:1, 2, AS) They have good reason to look back over a pleasant year of service, and the branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As soon as possible after the revolution we presented to the president of the country a petition asking that the decrees against the Society be revoked. Naturally, the change from a dictatorship to a democratic form of government takes time. What was instilled in the people during twelve years cannot be taken out in one year, but progress can be seen, and this is notable in our case. We enjoy freedom to preach, to go from door to door and to have our studies, although not in Kingdom Halls yet, but we hope and pray to Jehovah that soon we may be able to enjoy meeting together with all the brothers in the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most outstanding feature of the blessings received during the year was the series of circuit assemblies. Although not being legally organized, yet we have been able to do everything as Jehovah’s witnesses. The joy and emotion of being able to meet together in assemblies can be expressed only by those who attended. You can well imagine the joy and happiness of our brothers who for more than seven years have not been able to meet together in assemblies. There were many tears of joy at the nine circuit assemblies held during the last six months. The comments of the brothers and people of good will were: ‘I never thought that an assembly could be an occasion of so much joy.’ In some cases the sisters assigned to give experiences were so full of emotion that they could not finish their parts. I estimate that eighty percent of the publishers in Argentina had never before been able to meet together in assemblies with their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One brother has been attending meetings for some time, but could not see how real love could exist in any organization, but after the assembly in Rosario he said: “I saw love everywhere—in the speakers and their talks, in the lines to the cafeteria, where everybody kept perfect order. Love between young and old. Love in the contributions, and to such an extent that all expenses were paid and money left over for the next assembly. Now I believe that the New World society is based upon love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Special publishers have been Increased this year, for which we are very thankful to Jehovah, because we have much territory that has never been worked. In August sixty-four reported and for September there will be sixty-nine of these publishers in the field. They have done a very good work. They have been able to form five new congregations and there are very good possibilities of forming more in the next few months. Some of these brothers have been sent to help weak congregations, and an increase has come almost at once in publishers and in the maturity of the brothers. We are looking forward to the great expansion that these brothers will help to attain in the next twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Vacation pioneering has helped many of the brothers see the great privilege of working full time for their Father, Jehovah. There were 230 brothers who had this privilege and thirteen of these have continued as general pioneers. In several congregations from ten to twenty brothers have enjoyed this privilege of service together. From one congregation fourteen brothers who were vacation pioneers wrote and said: “We recommend to all our brothers in all congregations that they try vacation pioneering and prove for themselves the unspeakable joy of this provision of service in Jehovah’s organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Clean organization has been stressed and with very good results. In just one circuit seventeen couples have legalized their marriages. There are several more that will do likewise in the next few months, or as soon as they get all their papers. In some cases it has been necessary to cut all contact or association and not allow them to come to the studies, because they did not want to get married, but as soon as they saw that they could not live in common-law marriage and be in the New World society they straightened out their affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We give thanks to Jehovah for the provision of six more missionaries who will soon be with us. Also we are very thankful for the printing press so that we can print the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> in Spanish here in Argentina and the many forms needed for the service. I am sure this help will result in expansion. The new film and the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”</span><span class="font3"> in Spanish will help too. We have all these things to use in our ministry during the 1957 service year, so we have every reason to expect expansion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is a real joy to see the New World society growing so well in Australia and in the territories under its jurisdiction. During the past twelve months there has been a splendid increase in the number of those associating themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses, and all those in the New World society today can see the fine organization that Jehovah has formed throughout the world for guiding his people and giving them spiritual food. When one comes into the organization he is eager to preach, not only in his own home town, but out in distant territory. This has occurred in Australia. In the South Pacific there are many islands that need working, and it makes our hearts glad to see congregation publishers leaving their home country and moving off into these isolated places, because they know that there the good news of the Kingdom must be preached. It is something that probably many of Jehovah’s people could do when they seek first the Kingdom interests. Then they move into territory where these interests of the Kingdom can best be served. The report from the branch servant in Australia is most enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Five years had passed since Brother Knorr’s visit to Australia in 1951. In that time we had seen and experienced the blessings of increase and spiritual prosperity. With good reason, therefore, we keenly anticipated his visit in March of this year, at which time a national convention was held in Sydney. There was something about the visit and assembly that has made everyone work harder than ever before. For the first time in ten years great numbers of publishers from every state were able to assemble in one place. Visiting brothers came from Samoa, Fiji, Papua and New Caledonia. Special meetings for circuit, district and congregation servants have proved highly beneficial; persons interested in the South Pacific missionary field were interviewed and there was a delightful program for all in attendance, especially highlighted by stirring counsel from Brothers Knorr and Adams. All of this has had a wholesome, stimulating effect upon us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the two-month campaign, when the special issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> was used, we reached a 96.5-percent increase over the total magazine placements in the same period the year before. Not nine a month but ninety a week, and, in exceptional cases, even ninety a day have been placed by some zealous publishers. One group of six brothers left 500 magazines in one day. They had to return home several times to replenish their supplies. A circuit and a district servant, while having their lunch break, decided to witness to a group of Italians who were standing and talking on the street. In half an hour fifty magazines were put out. They were taking magazines from the brothers just as people take papers from a newsboy on a busy street. Experiences like these helped to put the number of magazine placements over the million mark, a 49-percent increase over last year’s figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the convention twenty-nine persons have left Australia and have become established in several different territories under this branch. Single brothers, married couples and even a family of five have made their way to various Pacific islands, and this shows how many congregation publishers who want to share in missionary service can do so. Without exception all of them have found much interest that needs to be developed. One brother tells what happened on his arrival in New Britain. “I didn’t intend to write so soon but feel I must say a little. On four successive nights we had a study with a family who simply love the truth. After each visit we could hardly get away; they wanted us to stay longer and look up scriptures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Incidental witnessing should never be minimized. This point is illustrated by the following letter that a young man wrote to a brother recently: “Last year you were traveling on a train and two young fellows joined you. I am the one who was very much interested in your conversation and took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘New Heavens and a New Earth’ </span><span class="font3">from you and obtained a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They certainly woke me up to a few things, so much so that I sent to Strathfield and procured </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Make Sure of All Things’</span><span class="font3"> and three volumes of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> and other books. Jehovah’s witnesses in T--- contacted me and I have been going to every</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">meeting. You don’t know how pleased I am for that little chat we had on the train. But for that meeting I should still be ignorant of the truth. I shall always remember that day as the turning point of my life.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark206"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>AMERICAN SAMOA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Wonderful work is being done in this territory. Bible studies are easy to start and are conducted in a variety of places. Some are held aboard boats in the harbor, in schoolhouses, the bakery, and one is even carried on in the local jail. In connection with the study at the jail an interesting event took place during the circuit servant’s visit. The attorney general had given permission for the prisoners to attend the public meeting. Just before the talk was to begin a policeman led a procession of fifteen prisoners across the square to the town’s main hall. These men listened more intently than any of the others. After the lecture one of them said: “We’re really sorry we have done wrong so that we are in jail. But now that we’ve heard these things we want to learn to be true Christians so that we can use our lives to fight on the right side.” One of the policemen remarked that the atmosphere at the jail is much different now that a study is in progress among the inmates. The attorney general seems pleased too and has volunteered to do all he can to help the study to be a success, although he himself is a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the elementary school supervisors who visits different schools on the island has done much witnessing during the lunch hours and also conducts studies after school. He has placed much literature and has had a big share in reaching outlying areas with the truth. Another school supervisor who has been attending congregation meetings adopted the method set out on the ministry school counsel sheet in making observations on the abilities of the teachers. When the director of education asked him how it was that his reports were so improved he gave full credit to the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and their superior training in the ministry school.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>FIJI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The visit of Brother Adams combined with the Suva assembly was the big event of the year. It was a great stimulus to the local publishers as well as the visiting brothers from Samoa and Rotuma. Since then the work has surged ahead here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A number of very promising isolated groups have developed and there are wonderful prospects for starting some new congregations before long. In one of these areas an honest-hearted Methodist preacher was called on during the unassigned territory campaign. Right after the publisher had witnessed to him he lost no time in getting dressed in clean clothes and accompanying the brother in house-to-house preaching. After attending a public meeting at the school he said to the brother who gave the talk: “All you say is true. Why, even after going to our church a hundred times we would never hear anything like that. This is the place to come if we want to hear the truth.” He now associates with the small study group organized in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many schoolteachers manifest a keen interest in the good news that we preach. During one week the circuit servant witnessed to three headmasters and eight other teachers. All showed great interest, asked questions and obtained subscriptions for the magazines or obtained other literature. At one place a young schoolteacher who had been called on a few times was used to interpret a public talk into the local dialect. After it was over he said: “That was hard for me because I was interpreting things I never knew to be true before.” He was so impressed with the truth that he spent a weekend of his vacation at a brother’s place to learn how to study the Society’s books properly. Later, the circuit servant spent three weeks at this good-will person’s home while pioneering. A group study was soon started, the young teacher started out in service and expressed the belief that he could not serve old-world interests as well as the new. He decided that the ministry would be his career.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>NEW CALEDONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The congregation publishers who arrived here from Australia are learning the French language so they can more effectively help the local population. Already sixteen persons are attending the studies now being held and among this group is an Indo-Chinese family of Buddhists. One of the daughters can speak French and acts as interpreter while the study is conducted. Even though these people had never heard of Jehovah or Christ Jesus they showed an immediate love for the New World after going through the tract on that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many Tahitians and Wallis islanders are brought in to relieve the labor shortage. One day a brother had an opportunity to witness to a person of this latter group. He asked the man if he knew God’s name. The Wallis islander replied that it was Jesus Christ and included Mary too. When he was asked if he had heard of Jehovah his eyes lit up. “Yes, that is right,” he declared. “It is in the Wallis Bible.” So the brother was able to convince him that Jehovah was supreme and Mary was a daughter of Adam, whom Jehovah created. To this the goodwill person registered approval by saying: “That is right, Jehovah, Jehovah.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>PAPUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Despite Intense opposition the Kingdom message continues to spread rapidly in this rich field. Though many natives are intimidated and their children threatened with expulsion from school if they study with Jehovah’s witnesses, large groups come together to be taught the way of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first call is often turned into a study, with many attending. The initial visit to a small island resulted in a study with forty-five of the sixty-odd inhabitants of the small village in attendance. On another nearby island the village people assembled right after the brothers had arrived. They heard a talk and then had their Bible questions answered. They said the mission never explained the Bible to them in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Natives from different inland tribes often come to the principal town, contact the brothers and tell them they have heard about the truth in their village. Many of these join the study groups in operation and write back to their home village about the things they are learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the circuit servant’s visit it was a delight to see 440 in attendance at the Sunday meetings. Eight tribes were represented. An immersion service was held and seventy-three were baptized. Two new congregations were organized and there is better supervision of the territory. One of the new congregations of eleven publishers reported an average of fifty-six attending the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study the very first month.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>SOLOMON ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There are many interested native people here who want to learn of Jehovah’s purposes. Some have walked many miles to contact the lone European witness that worked in this territory the first seven months of the service year. Several times a headman came fifteen miles to the plantation where the brother was located and obtained literature. Once he asked for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font3"> of the Bible. He liked that one best because, as he put it, it says: “Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name.” Another native walked twenty miles to get some Bible literature. He told the brother that on the island to which he would later return there were many boys who knew about the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The spread of the truth among the natives has evidently stirred the false religious shepherds to publish and circulate lies about us and to try to stop further progress. In March a Proclamation was given prohibiting the importation of the Society’s publications. Shortly thereafter the European brother was charged with possessing seditious literature, fined and later ordered by the police to leave the Protectorate. A month later a native person of good will had most of his Bible aids seized and was fined. However, he remains firm, together with several others who are convinced of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Letters of protest have been sent to the European and native members of the advisory council. It was pointed out that the Society’s publications have free circulation in other British possessions; that the ban is inconsistent with the principles of freedom and discriminates against a small group because of their religion. The circuit servant was able to make personal representations in behalf of the Society by explaining the work in fuller detail to the officials. Up to the present time the high commissioner has not removed the prohibition.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark212"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>WESTERN SAMOA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Although the government has again refused to grant permission for the Society’s missionaries to enter this territory and even restricted the circuit servant’s length of stay for his usual visit, the witness work moves ahead triumphantly. During March six of the local brothers enjoyed some blessed association with their fellow servants in Fiji and New Zealand. Five of them attended the Suva assembly, while the congregation servant had the privilege of going to Auckland. It was their first convention and they returned full of enthusiasm, which no doubt was contagious and served to spur others on to greater activity. The congregation publishers averaged 27.5 hours in the field each month, placed four times as many books and booklets as last year, while magazine distribution skyrocketed with a 660-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One publisher, after leaving some magazines with an interested person, was answering some of his questions and the conversation was overheard in the next room by a member of the government. Imagine the brother’s surprise when, a few days later, he received a phone call from this man, who said he could not help but hear the discussion and has enjoyed the magazines himself. This official feels so strongly about our missionaries’ being denied entry that he is taking independent action to try to bring about justice in this regard.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The people of Austria do not have armed soldiers from other countries watching them all the time now. The occupation forces have left. This does not mean, however, that the people are free. Mankind can be made a slave to many things, not only to nations, but to materialism, to prosperity, to a desire for the things of this world. The Bible tells us that it is the Word of God that will make us free and the more one gets an understanding of it the more real freedom will be manifest in the earth. In Austria during the past year there were 552 baptized, showing that they had found this real freedom, the freedom that lasts and takes away fear and allows one to move ahead to preach the good news of God’s glorious kingdom. The branch servant sent in a very interesting report, and we rejoice with him in the advancement of the work in Austria. Here are some excerpts from the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A special pioneer writes: “When going from house to house I met a woman who said at once that I should go, as she was not interested. I replied that she did not know yet what I wanted. She answered that she was not interested in the new faith, and that I should go. But before I left I asked her if she did not want to live eternally. She hesitated a few seconds and then said: ‘Yes, but . . .’ Thus I was able to give her a good witness built upon the special issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. I</span><span class="font3"> left this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> with her and when I called back she had read it and wanted to know especially the purpose of our mission. I said: ‘To make disciples, but no members.’ She replied that even if she agreed with much of what we say, she would not be able to go from house to house. I was surprised to find myself talking about service problems to a person who had been interested for only eight days. I told her: ‘Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh,' and asked her whether she had spoken to anybody about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> She said: ‘Yes, to my fourteen-year-old daughter.’ ‘You see, that is the mission,’ I said, ‘and because Jehovah’s witnesses do not have so many daughters, sons, relatives and friends, they go out from house to house.’ Then I left with her another </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True?’</span><span class="font3"> The following week she had read the magazine and apologized for having read ‘only half’ of the book. Again we discussed ‘service problems.’ She had been forced by her mother to go to church and therefore wanted her daughter to decide freely for herself. I agreed and arranged with both a home Bible study. At the third back-call we began studying and the daughter too showed real interest. Now this woman is worried about her little son, because in two years the religious lessons start at school for him. I explained that really she as mother was the proper teacher of religion, and for her to learn more, I invited her with daughter and son to attend the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. They have come regularly ever since. At the fourth back-call we arranged to go together to an interested woman to whom she had witnessed. I went with her and then she accompanied me to several of my back-calls. In June, only eight weeks after my first call, this woman of good will had spent twenty-nine hours in field service, and already has conducted a home Bible study by herself. At the end of July she was immersed at the district assembly. Since the beginning of August her daughter too has gone diligently from house to house, and wants to symbolize her dedication at the next circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A missionary shows how she was blessed for patient work: “In the door-to-door work I placed a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">with a strongly Catholic woman. When I called back she took it anxiously out of a drawer where she had hidden it. She had not read it for fear of burdening her conscience too heavily so she would have to confess it to the priest. Yes, she believes in the Bible, but she could get one from the dean. I asked why she hadn’t gotten one yet although she had been a Catholic all her life. Twice she had to go to the dean, and at last he gave her a New Testament with the Psalms. She was already at the Gospel of Luke when I called again—and she knew what she had read! Now I could prove to her that my Bible was not false and that Jesus himself had pointed out the importance of the Hebrew Scriptures. She then took a complete Bible from me, which we used in the studies. Slowly she overcame her prejudice against our literature, but there were still many obstacles. At Easter she showed me a big candle, the ‘Easter-light,’ she said hesitatingly. I asked her whether Jesus thought of a wax candle when he said: ‘You are the light of the world.’ This made her think, and she began to attend the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. Soon she saw the importance of Kingdom service, and her report for last month showed twenty hours. It was a great joy when she was immersed at the district assembly. And the New Testament of the dean is still a good help when somebody does not accept any of our publications because he is such a good Catholic!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Off the coast of Florida there is a group of islands known as the Bahamas. In this group there are nineteen that have a good-sized population. Some are so small as to have only 320 people, but still it is the responsibility of the branch office to see that someone gets to all of these islands to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Out of the nineteen that are populated twelve have been served this year, and plans are being made so that the other seven will be covered next year, in addition to the ones presently being served. The brothers have worked hard and they have shown a very good increase in gathering together the other sheep. There was a new peak of 136 publishers who are helping the people to get a knowledge of God’s Word. A new congregation was established on the island of Grand Bahama. The film “The New World Society in Action” has helped considerably in showing the people what Jehovah’s witnesses are doing and how they work. The branch servant gives us a good report on some of the experiences of the publishers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several months ago the film “The New World Society in Action” was shown on the island of Eleuthera. It was shown at four places to about five hundred people. One of these places was a small town of six hundred, where there was an attendance of over one hundred and eighty. Many of these people had never seen a movie before and were very much thrilled with it. One thing that greatly impressed them was the speed at which the brothers in the factory worked. After the showing many people commented on this, and one who had studied previously mentioned: “I have been wasting my time, but I am really going to get down to business now.” “This must be the biggest religion in the world,” some said after seeing the pictures of the assembly in New York. During August we worked this section with magazines, drawing to the peoples’ attention that these were the magazines they had seen being printed in the film. Fifty magazines were placed in this small town in two hours, where before only a dozen magazines would have been placed in a whole day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We find that incidental witnessing can play an important part in bringing in the other sheep. Books do not always have to be placed first before the seed is sown. If we cannot leave any literature we can always leave our listener with something to think about. One sister, a missionary, was witnessing to a lady working in a shop, only to find little interest. Noting the lady had two children the publisher remarked about the importance of parents’ training their children and the need of the parents’ knowing the Scriptures, so as to be able to answer their children’s many questions. No further interest was shown, so the publisher left. A day or so later this same woman’s young daughter came home from school with several questions that required a Bible answer. The mother remembered her conversation with the witness a few days earlier and decided to look into her Bible a little more. When the next witness called she agreed to start a Bible study. She advanced quickly. After a few months’ study she started to witness herself, attended an assembly in Nassau, which meant a boat trip of one hundred and twenty miles each way, was immersed and returned home to aid her mother also to learn the truth and take her stand. Our district assembly in August saw the sister’s mother immersed, in symbol of her dedication. Two new witnesses in less than a year from a casual remark about children’s inquisitiveness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Good results have been had by those who saw the opportunity to vacation pioneer and did so. Three sisters from a local congregation in Nassau wanted to vacation pioneer and offered to go to one of the out islands. Their selection was the island of Exuma. This island is part of our isolated territory, so their selection was a good one, as it gave the people there an opportunity to gain a knowledge of the truth. They had many interesting and joyful experiences. In a period of a little over two weeks they were able to place seventy-one books and arouse some good interest. They are still making back-calls on these people through the mail and hope to keep the interest alive until the circuit servant can arrange a visit. The three sisters expressed happiness over their pioneering and all said that they hope to go vacation pioneering again next year, possibly to another isolated island. We hope that other brothers here will take the opportunity extended to them to vacation pioneer and work on some of the islands in the Bahamas that are not witnessed to regularly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is good to report that the brothers in Belgium are making progress, not at the same speed as in 1955 with regard to the percentage of increase, but still they are going ahead gathering together other people of good will. This is an age of materialism and Belgium feels the effect of this in her nation, as all of Jehovah’s witnesses feel it in their lands. Jehovah’s witnesses must be very firm in their position in these last days and must appreciate that we are living in days like those Paul found when he was preaching to the Romans. He said: “Now present your members as slaves to righteousness with holiness in view.” (Rom. 6:19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Before the brothers made a dedication to Jehovah God they were slaves to things of this world, but changes come. Materialism can no longer hold those of the New World society, but they seek first the Kingdom and its interests. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences that have occurred in the country during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Both young and old are sharing in this increase. Some may think that little could be accomplished by young children’s going from house to house with magazines before the area book study. The following experience shows that such young publishers can accomplish much. In one of the units of the Brussels congregation, a young girl of nine or ten years of age placed two magazines while taking part in the door-to-door work before the area book study. This placement opened the way for the girl’s father to establish a home Bible study with the householder. Jesus was not foretelling something impossible when he said that “out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise.” —Matt. 21:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It happens at times that publishers meet people who say that nothing will ever make them change their religion. One of the special pioneers met a woman who greeted him in such a manner, saying that she would never leave the Catholic Church. Here is the experience as recounted by the pioneer himself: “While I was working from house to house a woman at one door replied to my introduction that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses by saying: ‘And I am a Catholic, and I intend to stick to my church.’ She added that she would buy nothing from me. However, putting my book bag on the ground, I told her I had not come to sell her anything but to speak with her about God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We got to talking about the fact that so few people today have a firm and sincere faith. Using the Bible, I showed her how Jesus taught his followers to pray and she admitted that not many people pray in the way Jesus instructed. After I had drawn her attention to some passages in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font3"> and especially in the chapter ‘The Way to God in Prayer,’ she said: ‘I should like to read that book, though of course I shall never associate with you people or quit going to my church.’ I told her she certainly must never do that to please me, but recommended she read the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The next week my wife made the return visit and discussed further points from the book with this woman. After about an hour’s discussion my wife asked if she could call again the following week and the woman agreed. Before she realized it she was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. She is happy to see my wife each week when she goes to study with her and has already stopped going to church!” Such an experience shows that we must never think that a householder will not accept the truth just because he tells us that nothing will ever make him change his religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>BERLIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has a fine branch office in Berlin to look after the work in that little island city within the borders of Eastern Germany. It also serves to give assistance in every way that it can to the brothers in East Germany. It is wonderful to see the spirit of Jehovah’s people when they are under pressure, and it makes us think of Paul’s words when he said: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.” (2 Cor. 4: 8, 9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> That is the way many of our brothers behind the Iron Curtain feel, and it shows that their real confidence is in Jehovah God and that he will bring them relief in his own time and in his own way. Our brothers in this part of the world live more like the early Christians than those in the Western part of the world, or in what are called free nations, because they are continually hounded by the totalitarian rulers. Godless persons would have all Christians annihilated, for these Communists say there is no God and they hate people who believe in God. But the truth that was brought to the world by Christ Jesus will never fade from this earth. In proof of this we have a very wonderful report from the branch in Berlin. Here are but a few of the interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems not to be advisable to tell much about the development of the work within the territory of the Berlin branch, in which also East Germany is embraced, where the work is still banned by the Communist rulers. But it can be said that it has proved to be a very good thing to have a close organizational connection between West Berlin and East Germany, which permits the West Berlin publishers to co-operate full scale with their brothers in East Germany. When these come to the “island” of West Berlin to get spiritual food for themselves and their brothers at home, the Berlin brothers see their privileges in cultivating the Christian virtue of hospitality, and they in turn receive great encouragement from the faithful endurance and devotion manifested by their brothers in East Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It makes us very glad to say that since the downfall of the Stalin idol outright persecution has diminished noticeably. New arrests of brothers decreased to a very few cases a month, and it is for the first time during the six years of the ban that the number of brothers released from prison exceeds the one of new incarcerations. There were 102 new cases reported of publishers who were imprisoned, while 211 were released, fortyeight of them even ahead of the time of their full prison terms. But it would be premature to speak of a termination of the persecution. Still more than 1,300 brothers and sisters suffer in East German prisons. Yet they are in good spirits, as they know that Jehovah will release them in his due time, if men fail to correct the wrong done to them so far. Quite often it occurs that released brothers tell us that the severe test that they underwent stirred them only to greater appreciation of Jehovah’s truth and the service entrusted to them and that they came out of the Communist prison spiritually stronger than they went in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But also other people are benefited when Jehovah’s witnesses are put in prison. One brother related that at a general change of accommodation in a penitentiary a prisoner stepped up to the group of brothers. When the warden asked him: “Since when have you been one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” the prisoner replied: “I became one in 1953.” The warden shouted out: “Is it possible to become a witness of Jehovah even in jail? You were punished because of resistance against the executive power of the state.” The prisoner answered: “I have now become one of them, because they tell the truth.” Thereupon the keeper, in a friendly mood, locked him up with the brothers. The brothers who witnessed this prisoner’s taking his stand for the truth saw that it pays to continue preaching in troublesome season and they were greatly strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The truth is not only preached in East Germany inside prison walls, but many thousands of publishers are outside, and they are just as eager and busy helping people of good will hear Jehovah’s message. They do not have service meetings or a ministry school. They are constrained to work with their Bibles alone, as the literature is banned. They cannot make notes, and have to avoid any appearance of organized activity, if they do not want to be arrested and put in prison. But still they continue paying their spiritual tithes by regularly getting out in the Kingdom service, and Jehovah blesses their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the 1,740 brothers immersed last year were from East Germany, and at the Memorial night celebration a greater number of persons were assembled with Jehovah’s people in East Germany than at any time before, despite six years of fierce persecution, with more than 1,300 still behind prison bars and approximately 3,000 that had to leave their homes as refugees to West Germany because of their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In West Berlin, where the work is free, the units have grown from twenty-nine to thirty-two. They have been using school buildings for their Kingdom Halls. But these halls often are not available when they are needed, on a circuit servant’s visit or so. We hope that shortly fifteen units will use their own halls, which will certainly add to the development of the theocratic interests in this city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our district assembly in Berlin instilled new strength and vigor. It was attended by 13,594, who unanimously adopted the resolution in behalf of our brothers in the U.S.S.R. The mighty oval of the stadium echoed their thunderous “Ja” into the silence of the night. They were especially thrilled about it, thinking of their beloved ones and close companions behind Communist prison bars in East Germany. For the public talk the attendance rose to 18,137.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">High in the mountains of the Andes Jehovah’s witnesses are moving about preaching the good news. Our brothers there realize that there is much to be done in order to give the witness in this vast territory. One thing that makes them very happy is that three local pioneers have now become special pioneers and they are working in isolated territories. They hope that it will not be long before others join them. At the present time there are twenty-nine missionaries in the land, scattered in all parts, trying to reach the people with the message concerning the new world of righteousness. The brothers have their difficulties because of the lack of education, and with the Indian population being held in darkness by the religious systems. Many joyful experiences have been had by those in the territory and the branch servant sets out some that will make our hearts glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have had a very happy time assembling and preaching together in Bolivia this past service year. The annual service report shows there have been some improvements in various features of the activity and we are very glad to see this. New territory has been opened up during the year and also a new congregation has been added to the list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The showing of the film “The New World Society in Action” has been very effective and has helped the people to get acquainted with the New World society. It has been shown seventy-one times to 14,779 people, and has been shown repeatedly in some cities and in the mining towns. In Cochabamba it was shown nine times and in Potosi four times, and each time the audiences seemed to have appreciated it more than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When it was shown to a small group of office men of the tin mine in Pulacayo, they enjoyed it so much that they agreed to have the local paid picture in the local cine canceled the next night so as to put on our film free for the miners and the people of the town. Besides the handbills distributed the administrator of the cine put out a sign “Don’t miss this unusual picture.” It was shown to a full house of more than 600 persons, and the audience enjoyed it very much. The next day it was shown in a hall in a hospital there also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers report various interesting experiences about finding persons of good will with whom studies resulted and also about persons becoming interested out in the country far from congregations and Kingdom Halls. A missionary sister in La Paz, delivering subscription magazines to a subscriber, got into a discussion with the man’s young daughter over the question of Christ’s literal brothers. The girl had so many texts to support her side of the argument that she just knew that Jehovah’s witnesses were lying when they said that Mary had other children after the birth of Jesus. However, when the evidence was presented that, besides the cousins of Jesus, there were his brothers also, some of whom had the same names as his cousins, she began to realize that she did not know the Bible as thoroughly as she had thought and she was confused. She prayed to her virgin that if the missionary was wrong and her church right, she should not let her come again, but if the missionary was right she should let her come. The missionary came the very next day. The missionary counseled that rather than trust in any kind of superstition, she should study the Bible with her so that she could be absolutely sure of what to believe and what steps to take, and the girl consented. Now she thoroughly enjoys the study and the subjects covered thus far because she knows they are based on the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another missionary sister reported quite an unusual experience from Cochabamba. One day she was surprised to find an Indian man at the door with a Spanish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> in His hand when she answered the doorbell. He was from the country and he told how, upon reading his Bible, he found that it taught about Jehovah God and that Christ Jesus worshiped his Father as God, whereas his “Evangelical” Church put Jesus foremost without so much as mentioning Jehovah. He had come to Cochabamba some time before to look for the organization that worshiped Jehovah as God, and, after walking up and down the streets, he came across the Kingdom Hall. He attended three meetings during the circuit servant’s visit, and, without saying much, obtained the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font3"> which he then studied after going back home. He tried to continue with his church, thinking he could teach them about Jehovah, but he was soon convinced that it was not Jehovah’s organization. He abandoned the church and politics and began preaching on his own, He realized that Jehovah had an organization and therefore he went back to Cochabamba again to learn more about that organization. Encountering the sister, he studied every day with her, attended all the meetings that week and also went out in the service from door to door. Now he continues to give a witness in his community, comes and visits with the brothers in Cochabamba every month and sends in his report regularly. The Good Shepherd knows his sheep and it is evident that he directs the ingathering.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Just ten years ago there were a few hundred publishers preaching the good news in Brazil, but now the number has grown to 9,596. That was the peak for April, 1956. So in but a decade thousands have come into the organization and these have to be brought on to maturity. Some of them are mature, but one can easily realize how young they are in the truth. They are of tender years, spiritually speaking. While the great multitude has come into the organization very rapidly the Society has to look after the teaching and the direction of this great crowd. It makes one think of what the wise man said years ago in Proverbs 18:15: “The thoughtful mind is eager to know more, the wise man longs to learn.” It seems that there are many, many people in Brazil who long to learn the truth and they are searching it out. Brazil is a progressive nation and the people are progressive. It is a good place for Jehovah’s witnesses to preach the Kingdom. The preaching is a very serious matter, for the Word of God says: “The king favors an able minister, his anger is for the incompetent.” (Prov. 14:35) So as the years go on Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere try to become more competent and able ministers to the praise of Jehovah God. Some interesting experiences are reported by the branch servant and recorded here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Over 17,000 persons attended the Memorial celebration, or 2,300 more than last year. In the majority of activities there was a delightful increase. Magazine placements more than doubled during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Right after a successful assembly in Manaus, the circuit servant was off to make the very first visit to isolated publishers in the upper reaches of the Amazon River Basin. It was possible to arrange passage on government planes to both places. Imagine the pleasure of this servant when the brother in Cruzeiro do Sul demonstrated his desire to be on the pioneer list, and thus expand right worship in that area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A man, Pentecostal for five years, acquired a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">book. The local pastor managed to get it away from him, but he obtained another. Studying with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he was brought to dedication. He spoke to family and friend alike, and thus first one nephew, then another, then his sister and her daughter, then another sister and her three daughters and then his son dedicated themselves. Imagine the happiness of these ten persons, all active in God’s service!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even a traveling circuit servant can have proof of his labors in the field. One met a man who listened well to his Bible sermon, accompanying with rapt attention the texts being read. Four months later, on another visit to the congregation, this man of good will greeted the circuit minister at the Kingdom Hall and said: “Hello there, how are you? Yes, I’m progressing well in the work.” This proves how effective a well-prepared Bible sermon can be at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another experience demonstrates the importance of co-operation in the field service. A young sister about ten years old placed a booklet and then asked one of the mature brothers to accompany her on the back-call. The family were all Catholic, but the true light of God’s purposes, shining forth from the Bible held in focus by the hands of a qualified preacher, soon awakened in their hearts the desire to know more about the New World hope. To the glory of Jehovah the head of the family is now a servant in the local congregation and his children are all regular publishers, including one daughter who, now a zealous witness, was before the most rigorous Catholic of them all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Those dedicated to Jehovah God in British Guiana are coming on to maturity and it makes our hearts glad to know that one of the local brothers now has been appointed as a circuit servant. It is good wherever possible to use mature brothers of the land to help organize the other sheep that come into the organization in these countries. They understand such ones better, they are used to the country and the habits of the people and it makes the local publishers rejoice to see that from their own midst overseers are appointed that can take the proper lead. All those associated with the New World society should strive for maturity, for with greater knowledge come greater blessings and grander privileges of service. The branch servant in British Guiana gives us some interesting experiences of how they are reaching out into new territory with the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For years the coastlands of British Guiana have received regular witnessing, but the sparsely populated hinterland of forests and savanna has been seldom reached. This year a circuit servant spent five weeks going by plane, jeep and horseback to ranches in the Rupununi hinterland, where he found a number of people who had read our literature in the past. By using the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good, News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font3"> he established a number of group studies, held public meetings and showed the film. These group studies, from which reports are received, are now in touch with the branch office. In the Northwest district two missionary sisters spent three months starting from scratch. After thoroughly witnessing to the small settlement several times they left behind two new publishers, one of whom is now regularly reporting eight Bible studies and many placements among the Amerindians of the river districts, where they were unable to penetrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ten percent of the congregation publishers this year became vacation pioneers and in many cases for more than one month. Among these were mothers with as many as four to nine children each that had to be gotten to school every day. Good organization, early rising and co-operation helped them achieve their goal. A regular pioneer sister revealed: “After ten years of pioneering I was on the point of giving up pioneering, but kind publishers assisted me and with my love of pioneer service I was given the determination; and then one day, when in the service, I noticed several children who could not be admitted to the public school until they were six years old. I remarked on this at the next house and the mother replied: ‘Can’t you help us with them? I would let you have a room for a classroom.’ Within a few days she rallied the neighborhood and I became teacher to twenty children in my private school, and for the past two years have taught school and remained a pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new booklet on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”?</span><span class="font3"> has proved very timely and has become the basis of discussion with a spiritist woman who, time and again, had evaded the pioneer, as she had been busy with her spiritistic activities. Then she chanced upon one of her former spiritistic associates who was now in the “Truth” and again she met the pioneer. Another Bible discussion and she vowed to break down her altar at home. Remarkably, though her husband was a leader of the cult, he co-operated and down came the altars after he heard the Bible arguments. Now together they study </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> no longer sitting in the dust or keeping sabbath observance. Another man was offered this same booklet, because it was known that he was a spiritualist. This led to a Bible study and a change of conduct and he is now a publisher.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Even though the hurricane “Janet” brought great destruction on the country of British Honduras and untold hardship, Jehovah’s witnesses continued to go forth giving comfort to the people and showing them what the only hope for the world is. It is most encouraging to observe that in British Honduras they have had a fifteenpercent increase in publishers during the year and they reached a new all-time peak in publishers of 133. There are only 75,000 people in the entire country. This is a backward land, to compare with other countries. These people who desire to learn about life and the prospects of future life are entitled to it as much as anyone else, and it is the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to get into this territory, as they have been doing for years, to preach the good news. Fine experiences have been had by the brothers there and the branch servant sets out a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A copy of the April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> was placed with a businessman who seemed a bit indifferent but took it since it was a special issue. The publisher was reluctant to call back in view of his attitude, but did so when it was stressed that every placement should be followed up with a back-call sermon. On the return call the businessman had some questions to ask and showed interest in learning more. Soon a study was started with him, and then his wife, who was a stanch Catholic, also began to show interest. As they progressed they found great opposition from her Catholic friends as well as from his Protestant ones, but both are realizing that only through the New World society is a true understanding of the Bible to be found, so they are determined to continue their study. The publisher learned from this the value of following up even magazine placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More and more the tentacles of materialism are entangling mankind in a deathlike grip. Freeing oneself from these snares is often difficult. However, a young man here who came to the missionary home to ask for a study after coming in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses showed this can be overcome. He knew that since his work took up his time during the day his evenings must be kept free for Bible study. So determined was he that nothing should hinder the study he sold his radio, his record player and gave up evening pleasures so that every day of the week he could spend time studying his Bible along with the Society’s publications. His progress was marvelous. In two weeks’ time he was attending every meeting at the Kingdom Hall, was soon enrolled in the ministry school and before the month was over was engaging in the house-to-house work, sharing the precious truths with others. His amazing knowledge gained in such a short time shows Jehovah’s rich blessing upon those who value his Word above any material possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a person really lives the truth he proclaims it no matter where he is. That fruits are borne in this way was plainly seen in a Spanish village called Benque Viejo. A sister from Guatemala returned to care for her sick father. In this village there were none of Jehovah’s witnesses, so she began telling her relatives of the Bible truths she had learned since leaving home. Soon studies were started in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> and the truth began to shine brightly. After she spent five months in this unassigned territory her father died and she returned to her home but, because of her efforts, four families were free from the Catholic Church and many more had shown interest. Among these was a young lady who had begun her training to become a nun but, after studying carefully the Scriptural doctrines, she left her church and now plans to symbolize her dedication to Jehovah at the next assembly. The interest of all these people was strengthened by the showing of the film in their area, at which 800 persons were present. A missionary is now assigned to follow up the interest that is well kindled because a congregation publisher was preaching in season and out of season.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain have boomed ahead as never before. They increased their Bible studies by nearly 4,000 and their back-calls by nearly a quarter of a million. It made a big change in the forward movement of the New World society in Britain, for we find the service year ended with an eight-percent increase in the number of publishers and a new peak in publishers of 32,836 in April. While we rejoice in this great advance of gathering together the other sheep, all there still appreciate that there is much work to be done among the more than 50,000,000 in the land. The brothers have had an enthusiastic year. They have put up a wonderful fight and they are looking forward to 1957 and even greater blessings. We rejoice with our brothers in Britain and the splendid progress made during the 1956 service year. The branch servant sends in many interesting experiences that took place in Britain as well as in Eire, and on the island of Malta, all of which are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There could have been no better prelude to the 1956 service year than the Triumphant Kingdom assembly. The enthusiasm and vigor generated at Twickenham brought a new spirit and fresh confidence. Brother Knorr spoke to the servants straight from the shoulder about their responsibilities. Later the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> carried articles calling for an unequivocal stand against any compromise with Caesar, whether it be over Christian neutrality, pagan festivities or nationalistic tradition. How did the brothers respond?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the three years before 1956 there had been diminishing increases of five, four and then three percent in the average number of publishers reporting each month. But 1956 saw an increase of eight percent. The brothers, responding to the invitation of the yeartext, had brought in the tithes and, true to his promise, Jehovah had opened the windows of heaven and poured out a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Side by side with the growth in publisher ranks has been the growth in the pioneer ranks. For several years the number enrolled had been dropping steadily. But this year there was an increase of twelve percent in the average number reporting. In the vacation pioneer ranks there was phenomenal increase: 625 enrolled this year, to compare with 173 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wrote one vacation pioneer to the office: “I am writing to reapply for three months’ vacation pioneering from August to October, as the past three months brought me the greatest happiness and contentment. I already have the joy of having the companionship of the first study I started.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been a healthy increase (28 percent) in the number of home Bible studies being conducted. This upsurge is attributable mainly to the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”.</span><span class="font3"> In the short space of a few studies it roots out the basic errors and gives a clear over-all picture of the truth, including the privilege of preaching. This may account for the rapid progress of the new ones these days. A circuit servant writes that his wife started a study in the booklet at one visit and by the next visit, four months later, this householder was already an established publisher. Her husband is now interested also and she conducts a study with three neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines have also played a big part in accelerating the work in Britain. The distribution has Increased by 60 percent. Outstanding was the enthusiastic campaign with the special April 1 issue. It set many on the way to life. For instance, a painter, working at a publisher’s home, commenting on the fine spirit in the family, was given a copy of the special </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> He read it through that night. Next day little painting was done. The brother was home and had to answer one question after another. He started a study that week at the painter’s home. The following week the whole family came to the meetings and since then they have all become keen publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the London office received a letter from a secretary of the United Bible Societies, saying that the writer had been asked to make inquiry into the methods of Scripture distribution. &quot;No one can make such an inquiry,&quot; he wrote, &quot;without realizing that one of the most effective and efficient agencies for Scripture distribution is Jehovah’s witnesses.” In replying to this courteous letter the Society pointed out that our success was because of the noncommercial motives that prompt the Witnesses and because of the fact that our aim was not mere distribution, but education for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A spirit medium in a small town in North Wales took some literature and agreed to a study in her home. Soon she realized that spiritistic practices were foreign to Christian life and worship. So she told her clientele that she was finished with spiritism and was now one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In nine weeks she was a regular associate of the congregation at Bangor, a neighboring town, with her five young children. One Tuesday evening, missing the only bus, she and the children walked six miles over the hills rather than miss the group study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toward the close of the year we held district assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and at three places in England. The high light was, undoubtedly, the resolution to the Soviet authorities. The brothers were deeply stirred by the powerful, dignified wording of the petition on behalf of our persecuted brothers and showed it by their vigorous assent and sustained applause. The press gave good publicity to the assemblies and particularly to the resolution. Despite the atrocious weather the assemblies were thoroughly enjoyed. A total of 1,155 new ministers was immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Walsh</span><span class="font3"> appeal was heard by the House of Lords. The entire court of five judges held that since Jehovah’s witnesses have no clergy-laity distinction to give any of them a spiritual status superior to the others, they have no &quot;regular ministers.” Thus, a pioneer who makes the ministry his vocation in life is denied the privileges in law that are given to clergymen. And so is a presiding minister of a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. Far from discouraging the brothers, the decision has served as a stimulating challenge to Jehovah’s ministers in this land to prove that Jehovah has not &quot;adequately qualified” them in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year a suitable site was acquired and plans drawn up for new branch headquarters. The handsome and practical basic design of the building was supplied by the president and merely needed adapting to the site itself. It is in the Mill Hill area of London, convenient to the city and yet far enough out to have fresh air and plenty of space.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The outstanding event of 1956 in Eire was the district assembly in Dublin. Prior to this the only assemblies to be held had been circuit assemblies attended by about 200 people. The district assembly in the National Stadium with an attendance of 1,210 was, therefore, a big event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the dock, after the assembly, a brother was seeing off a party returning to England. As the boat drew out he noticed a woman weeping a little. He asked if he could help. She said she had just farewelled two of the best friends she had known. The brother offered her a lift in his car and on the way told her of the assembly. She was delighted and said that her new friends were Witnesses who had been sent to stay with her for the assembly. They were the kindest people she knew. It was not difficult to arrange for a Bible study at the home of that meek person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Sunday, May 13, a different type of incident occurred. A missionary and a new publisher were calling on the homes a few miles out of Limerick, traveling on a motorcycle. Along a lonely road they were ambushed by a group of men, but were able to get away from them. Being followed in cars they made for town, but took a wrong turn into a blind road at the top of which was a hotel. There was no telephone there and no policeman near. Cars arrived at the bottom of the road, parked so as to block off all exit, and then the mob, led by the parish priest, closed in on them. They confiscated the bags of literature, bullied the brothers and ordered them out of the district. Later they publicly burned the books in Clonlara, a nearby town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The case was put in the hands of the police, who eventually prosecuted the priest and nine other men. In the court sat the bishop and many priests. The judge dismissed the cases against the priest and eight of the men. The other man was found guilty but dismissed under the Probation Act. Then came the astonishing twist. The judge bound over the two Witnesses, the injured parties, on sureties of £200 each to keep the peace, and in default three months in prison. This was something new! Not the mob bound over to keep the peace, but the two who had been mobbed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The decision, reported in the press throughout the country, provoked a wave of indignation. More than fifty letters appeared in the press about it. Needless to say, an appeal has been lodged.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>MALTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Early in the year the British brothers on Malta were transferred back to Britain, even though their terms had not expired. This all happened so suddenly and so thoroughly that it was obviously by design, a move to block the truth’s reaching the spiritually starving people of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Roman Catholic Church has much say in the government of Malta and, fearing the loss of control over the people, she stops at nothing to keep the island clear of missionaries of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, the arm of Jehovah is not so easily shortened. The meetings are being held regularly and some preaching is being done. The faithful ones are determined to keep true worship alive in this priest-ridden island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From Gibraltar a man of good will wrote the Society requesting literature. Although all alone he has been progressing well in the truth and now has begun preaching. Having been a Catholic he has had firsthand experience with that organization and that makes him love the truth all the more, now that he has found it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">News comes from this land behind the Iron Curtain that our brothers are still meeting together and studying the Word of God. A number of them are scattered in different villages, but from time to time they get in communication with others within the country and are built up spiritually. They are very eager for the meat in due season, which sometimes gets to them. The information contained in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font4"> has brought them great comfort as they have studied it. The material from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Equipped for Every Good Work”</span><span class="font4"> they also have, in addition to their Bibles, so they do have material to meditate upon and on which to build themselves up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just how many are really interested in the Word of God and preaching it we cannot say, but we have good reason to believe that there are approximately a hundred who have shown real interest in Jehovah’s kingdom. As opportunity affords the brothers will keep in touch with them and bring them the comfort that is possible under the circumstances. It appears that tourist trade will be sought in Bulgaria before too long, and if this comes to pass perhaps from time to time some of our brothers from the Western world will be able to visit those in Bulgaria. Our prayers continue to ascend to Jehovah for his holy spirit to direct them as they preach the good news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This is the first time in three years that the country of Burma has reported an increase in the number of publishers reporting field service. We sincerely hope that the other sheep will continue to be gathered and now with new magazines in Burmese and Chinese, along with the English magazines </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> going into Burma, there should be much new interest. More back-calls have been made during the year, but there was a decrease in the number of home Bible studies. This is something that must be watched in all territories. We must hold on to our Bible studies and develop more of them in order to bring people on to maturity. While we can plant much seed in the distribution of the truth by placing literature in the hands of the people, still this seed must be watered and nurtured and cared for if we are going to bring people on to the point of assisting Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching the good news of the Kingdom in all the world for the purpose of a witness. We hope that our brothers in Burma will pay more attention to Bible studies and follow through on their placements. Some of the experiences sent in by the branch servant are very interesting and are recorded here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The magazine work has contributed greatly to our increase. During your visit in April, Brother Knorr, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine in Burmese was released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The effect on the Burmese-speaking brothers has been wonderful, because many can now understand the truth and come to maturity, whereas before they found it difficult to do so. To compare this year with last year, we obtained nearly three times as many subscriptions and placed nearly three times as many individual magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Almost all publishers here are taking the training program seriously. Every mature publisher is assigned to help a weaker one. This arrangement is now bearing fruit, because when it is applied weak publishers grow strong and appreciation for the organization increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We appreciate the sermons that the Society prints in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font3"> Many of us cut them out and paste them in our Bibles. This serves as a ready reminder, and also gives us a greater variety of sermons for use in the field. It makes us happy to use these sermons, because thereby the message is given more effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here in Burma the Kingdom message is spreading. A brother writes: “While traveling along the Burma-China border I placed a considerable number of bound books, booklets and magazines. I also made it a point to hand out as many tracts and free booklets as possible, nearly all with the Society’s branch address stamped in them. I distributed this literature to persons who were going to remote places, and to others who would be in contact with such persons, in the hope that some of it might penetrate into nearby China. Whereas in the ordinary way one does not distribute literature free, there are times and places where such free distribution can do good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“For example, here in Bassein I called on an officers’ mess of an establishment we were not able to enter and presented the magazines free, asking that these be placed on the reading-room tables. A Chin officer read the literature, wrote to Rangoon for more, and, on our calling on him, gladly took a set of six books and was glad to have a weekly Bible study.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While doing unassigned territory work a year ago, two publishers contacted a person of good will who at once recognized the pure ring of the truth and was out in the door-to-door work the very next day. She continued to publish on her own in the little town and sent in reports regularly, but later her work took her into the jungles, where she was unable to communicate with us. After months she returned to town and wrote to us requesting a visit. The two publishers who visited her this time found a great change in her. She was once a habitual smoker and betel-nut and tobacco chewer, but had given up these habits entirely. She also used to waste much time attending picture shows, but now she uses every available moment to preach, witnessing to everyone with whom she comes in contact. She plans to attend our next district assembly and be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your visit here in April was certainly cause for great rejoicing by all the brothers, and we have worked hard to apply the good counsel you gave us. After you left all features of the work began to show an increase. Then in July a further impetus was given to the work by the visit of the zone servant. These two visits, together with the regular spiritual food provided by the Lord, have made us understand our position more clearly. Although increase in Burma has been slow in the past, we realize we must always maintain a spirit of optimism. Hard work and patience are bound to pay off rich dividends in the way of the “other sheep” flocking into Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When serious problems face Jehovah’s witnesses they have to meet them. It appears that a serious problem has occurred in Canada, for during the past year there were 2,671 persons baptized, or we can say they were newly dedicated to the service, whereas there were only 371 additional publishers in the field during the year. The question immediately arises as to what happened to the other 2,300 publishers. Did they not report, or has there been a falling away, or have those in overseers’ positions neglected some who have been in the truth and not brought them on to maturity? Has the love of some cooled? A great responsibility falls upon a congregation servant and all his assistants to look after his whole flock. He is a shepherd appointed by Jehovah and when so many new ones come in in a year and yet there is no like gain in the total number of publishers it really causes concern. Jehovah’s witnesses love their brothers and they do not like to see them fall by the wayside or become lax in their service privileges. We feel sure that the circuit servants, district servants and congregation servants will immediately take measures to check to see what has happened to all of these publishers who have entered the service and how they can be helped. Canada increased only one percent and this compares in no way with the number that were baptized. When problems arise we must face them, for Jesus said to Peter: ‘Feed my lambs.’ The branch servant of Canada gives an interesting report of experiences in the country and one of the outstanding experiences was that which happened in Quebec, where ten years ago the leaflet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Quebec’s Burning Hate for God and Christ and Freedom Is the Shame of ALL Canada</span><span class="font4"> was distributed. Yes, just ten years ago this leaflet was distributed in that Catholic-dominated territory. Then great hatred was manifested and Jehovah’s witnesses were going to be driven out of Quebec. But they are still there preaching the good news. Let us see what the branch servant reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Happy are we to be serving the happy God who finds pleasure in the happiness of his faithful people. One of the causes for happiness was the completion of the building for our new branch home, factory and office. The culminating point in our pleasure was the day of dedication, May 25, when you, Brother Knorr, were present. It was a happy and most blessed occasion. The following two days over 2,500 of our brothers from the surrounding district took advantage of our openhouse arrangement to visit, and it warmed our hearts to hear the audible expressions of happiness and pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Quebec throughout the year not one arrest or serious interference by the police was reported. Opposition is still encountered from fanatical religionists, and this is to be expected, because we are not of their world. The Supreme Court of Canada handed down a favorable judgment in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Chaput</span><span class="font3"> case, which has been reported in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> of January 22, 1956. This decision has helped police officers to realize they are acting illegally when interfering with our sacred service and pure worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A special pioneer received a good-will contact and visited a family of ten, who requested to have a Bible study commenced immediately in their home. After two months of study they wrote the local bishop and sent in their resignations from the Catholic Church. The children were transferred to an English Protestant school. Soon the parish priest visited in order to try to offset this loss. The family were able to counter all his arguments with references to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the sisters in Montreal (Quebec) had contacted a householder where the family asked for five magazines of each issue to be delivered, even though they did not appear to be very much interested themselves. The sister discovered that they were obtaining these five magazines for their elderly mother, who was resident in a home for the aged in Ontario. The contact was passed along to the local congregation, and we quote an excerpt from the letter received: “The call mentioned in your letter has been made and it is one that would warm the heart of any Kingdom publisher. The lady has been in the home fourteen years and has seldom left the building. She is now ninety-four years of age, has read many of the publications and has witnessed in her own small way to many of the other occupants of the home, using the regular supply of magazines. Her understanding of the New World and the Kingdom message is quite clear. Though she is not now allowed to leave the home, she talks of the Kingdom to every one she meets. We have now arranged for a sister to conduct a study with her in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font3"> and she is certainly overjoyed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Echoes of the Triumphant Kingdom assemblies in Europe last year continue to thrill us. Two pioneers in Quebec city recently boarded the &quot;Arosa” convention liner, were courteously received and given the freedom of the ship. Members of the crew showed much interest. One, a steward, recognized one of the brothers as a passenger last summer, and joyfully related his experiences in preaching. He had taken Italian and German literature for cooking- and diningroom members, and volunteered the information that his wife in Germany was now having a regular Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. On his request it was arranged that he attend one of our service meetings that same night. Imagine our joyful surprise when with him six other crew members also attended and expressed their appreciation for what they saw and heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another fine experience shows a deaf-mute ‘hearing’ and ‘preaching.’ The sermon had been presented by underlining the Scriptures and having the man read them himself. He was impressed, and asked the publishers to come back and help him prepare a sermon to give at the school for deaf-mutes. This was arranged and great was his joy at being able to study the Bible thus. A brother was located who could communicate with him in the sign language, so a regular study was started. Back-call sermons were prepared, which he repeated at the school for the deaf. Other attenders at the school commenced to ask questions, and the deaf-mute was able to ‘preach’ and to place literature with them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is very gratifying to see the work moving ahead so rapidly in Ceylon, especially during the past two years. Again there was a fine increase of forty percent, to compare favorably with last year’s forty-eight-percent increase. This has brought great joy to the missionaries in the country, special pioneers and the congregation publishers themselves. They see the blessing of Jehovah upon their efforts and it is observed in their report that good attention is given to all features of the work, such as back-calls, Bible studies and the distribution of magazines. They are indeed delighted that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is now published in Tamil, and their good increase in subscriptions was largely because of this new publication’s being offered in Ceylon. The branch servant makes some interesting comments on the work there and a few of the experiences are printed herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are now six special pioneers working in the island apart from the Gilead graduates and this year it is from these Ceylonese brothers in the pioneer service that the most interesting experiences come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although there has been theocratic prosperity manifest in Ceylon during the past year, the same cannot be said concerning those of the old-world society. During 1956 it seems that this erstwhile tranquil island has caught the fever of intolerance and violence that is spreading throughout the world. The issue? National language. The Singhalese population, which have a majority of about three to one, demand that their language become the only official medium of the country. The Tamils are just as vehement in demanding parity of status for their mother tongue. The situation reached fever pitch on the east coast and many lives on both sides were lost in rioting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the circuit servant and his wife were visiting the pioneers working in this area, fierce rioting broke out within a few hundred yards of a home where they were conducting a Bible study. Picture the situation: About eight o’clock at night. All seated in a Tamil person’s home, one of the pioneers himself a Tamil. An angry mob of Singhalese bearing down on the house, shrieking! Indeed it was a time for quick prayers to Jehovah for guidance in deciding what course to take. Quickly, the brothers and good-will family rushed from the Tamil house and crammed into a small storeroom at the rear of the neighbor’s house, who fortunately was Singhalese. No sooner had they hidden than the mob burst on the scene! The first thing they saw was the circuit servant’s motorcycle. This was overturned with several heavy blows from a club and then set afire. At this the Singhalese neighbor rushed out and shouted to the mob that the motorcycle belonged to a “white padre” and that there were no Tamils there. As if by a miracle she spotted a person in the mob whom she knew personally. This proved an advantage, for the mob believed her story. Throwing earth on the burning machine, they made off into the night looking for the next Tamil house—without even entering the home of the family of good will. The situation remained at exploding point for days, until finally the army was called out. A measure of peace and quiet has now returned to the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now the question in the brothers’ minds was, What effect would this experience have on the family of good will? It was only a few weeks before this that first contact had been made. This person had been in six different religious sects and finally had become Pentecostal, seven years ago. However, he admitted to be still searching for an organization with the real truth and was convinced that he had not yet found it. The pioneer reports: “No sooner had we broken down some of his unscriptural beliefs and pointed out some clear truths from the Bible than he wholeheartedly accepted what we were saying and straightway wanted four bound books. A week later he came over to see us and said, ‘I have read two of the books, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font3"> and there is no doubt in my mind that I have found the truth at last. I am shocked at the darkness I have been in all these years. I thank Jehovah for sending you to my house.’ He was so eager to know more that after a three-hour discussion he took two more bound books, adding, ‘I shall be very grateful if you come over and teach these things to my wife and family.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was at this stage that the circuit servant arrived and was taken to the home, and then the rioting began. Again the adage seemed to be true that “seeds grow fastest in a hotbed,” for within six weeks the husband, wife and twelve-year-old son joined in the house-to-house work and have continued to do so. His desire to share the truth with others was so great that before he started in the regular witness work he had helped two of his Hindu friends to get deeply interested in the Bible, and one of them has shown remarkable progress in knowledge and understanding in a little over a month’s time and is boldly defending the truth among his work mates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This report would not be complete without making mention of our appreciation for the zone servant’s visit during June. Brother Stewart’s visit and counsel were especially helpful at the branch office, and the arrangement for each missionary home to receive a regular call from a representative of the president’s office has proved stimulating and encouraging to all the missionaries. We all felt that this direct contact drew us into closer touch with Jehovah’s visible organization and refreshed in our minds the privilege of working in unity with our world-wide family of brothers, even though we are geographically located in a “small outpost.” All the missionaries join me in thanking Jehovah and his organization for this provision.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The country of Chile is a long, narrow strip on the Pacific side of South America. Some years back the work centered at Santiago and from there spread out into small towns nearby. But today the witnesses of Jehovah have reached to both ends of this country, from the northern to the southern, preaching the good news. In the past two years special efforts have been made by the Society to distribute the fifty-seven missionaries all over the country, to see if new congregations could be organized. Today there are thirty-one congregations scattered along this coastal country and the work is increasing very well. During the past year many new cities were opened up and a fine increase has been reported. Not only have the missionaries carried the work of preaching the good news into every nook and corner of the country, but special pioneers have assisted in this, and it makes us rejoice to see the great expansion. The branch servant gives us a very interesting report of some of the things that have occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The missionary activity of the New World society is being carried out all the way from the free port of Arica in the barren north to the far-distant, southernmost city in the world, Punta Arenas, on the Straits of Magellan, where the days lengthen to seventeen hours in the summer. Traveling those 2,620 miles through this ribbonlike strip of land with its 6,000,000 inhabitants helps you realize something that you might not have had in mind, that the area of Chile is greater than that of any European country, with the exception of Russia. Working isolated territory in Chile usually means going there to live, as travel is too costly and distance too great for Kingdom publishers to reach from their home congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Leaving behind friends that one has helped grow in Christian service from babes to maturity is not always easy for the missionary; sometimes those left behind appear to feel abandoned when the moment comes to say good-by to their former Bible instructors. But just as Jesus departed from his eleven faithful disciples after having trained them well, so today the missionary can expect these new Kingdom publishers to keep on progressing while they do as the apostles did and press on to even greater works than before, with Jehovah’s help through his active force. While some congregations fell back in number of publishers when missionaries left, they did show more maturity by improving their averages in Kingdom preaching activity. Their response in caring for more congregational duties is greatly appreciated. This need was called to the attention of all during the assemblies in the five circuits. Filling several places of responsibility in the local congregations, they have made it possible for greater and more rapid advance of full-time ministers into isolated territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The film “The New World Society in Action” has been used extensively to present New World operations to persons of good will. For a showing in an isolated city only those called on by the circuit servants were invited, because of lack of accommodations. Just imagine nearly every one of them attending: 110 persons! For nine days a circuit servant called back on these people. Many asked the very same question: &quot;When are we going to have a Kingdom Hall like the one we saw in the film?” Could you picture yourself taking thirty new subscriptions and thirty-two renewals in only nine days? The circuit servant did. He wrote that over fifty subscribers asked him about Bible studies in their homes. That took place in February this year and a missionary group is already living there to care for this interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Importance of the congregation book study and the ministry school was demonstrated by the encouraging experience of a young witness of Jehovah of about fifteen years of age. During a class discussion in school the subject of the cedars of Lebanon came up and the teacher asked if any in the class knew what they were. The sister was the only one that raised her hand and when asked she explained that the cedars were used in building Solomon’s famous temple in Jerusalem. &quot;How is it that you know about that?” the teacher asked. The young witness explained that they had Bible studies in her home, which led to a discussion on the Bible. Such interest was shown that the sister was asked to bring her Bible to school with her the next day to answer their questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At home that evening she prepared herself, reviewing chapters in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> that treat the subjects “Transmitting the True Record” and “Satan the Devil.” The next day she went to school well equipped with a Catholic version of the Bible and also a Protestant version. The teacher was ill and so there was open class for one hour, during which the sister was bombarded with questions from her twenty-four school companions. So many were the questions that she had to return the next day with the Bibles. The result was a marvelous witness to all, with two of her classmates in particular showing good interest. Since then one of them has even attended some meetings in the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in China are happy. They rejoice and they are moving ahead preaching the good news. When Christ Jesus commanded his people to preach the good news of the Kingdom in all the world he was not setting before any of them a particularly unpleasant task. Preaching the good news to meek people is a joy. Going to their homes and telling them all about the blessings of the New World brings Jehovah’s witnesses much pleasure. It is the world rulers that make the preaching of the good news difficult, because they dislike having people told about the comforting things of the future. Many rulers of the world seek to stifle the work of preaching and the light of truth, and they place prohibitions and restrictions on its circulation. That is how it has been in China for a long time. But the good news has never ceased to be preached, and God’s servants are represented in the land. There has been a steady ingathering of new ones into the New World society in China, and the branch servant there gives us some very interesting experiences that will make our hearts glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the beginning of the year prospects for expansion did not look so good. Our house-to-house preaching, after encountering continual opposition, had finally been stopped. The mature, zealous brothers kept on preaching and did excellent work among friends and any strangers they were able to contact. Many Bible studies were started in this way and we were able to average 1.3 home Bible studies monthly for the thirty-six publishers. But the problem was how to get the new ones and immature ones out regularly. After they witnessed to their friends their field of activity dried up and they became inactive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some brothers tried witnessing to folks in the parks, talking to friendly persons about the Kingdom and giving them Bible tracts. But many people were reluctant about arranging back-calls, as the big political campaigns against various religious sects made them afraid to get too closely associated with any organization or church. A sister talked to two young men who showed much interest in the witness and who were willing to give their address for a back-call to be made, but when the return call was made it was found to be the address of a police station and not that of the young men. Much tact was required in talking about the Kingdom; the use of common words in the theocratic vocabulary, such as comfort, hope and wickedness, were taken to mean that the witness was dissatisfied with the present government. Now that the people were enjoying their own man-made “new world” there was no wickedness left and the people were not in need of any comfort or hope!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toward the end of the year the government began to take a more liberal policy and publicly declared that the individual must be allowed more freedom and that he had the right to voice his criticism and opinions. In general the people were slow to take advantage of this relaxation of the tension, not being too sure about it. But the Lord’s people seized it and took up house-to-house preaching once again. August was the first month when we could get all the brothers out in this feature of the service and in that month we reached a new peak of fifty-seven publishers. So while we had a decrease over the whole year we were able to finish up reaching the twenty-percent quota for the year. So the prospects at the end of the year are much brighter than at the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A big problem in this part of the earth has been that of assisting the many baptized persons to stay with the organization and be active in the field. Those who are willing to study quickly get the truth and vision of the new world and then are eager to be baptized. But very often they later drift away, following worldly interests or becoming afraid of persecution. There is no depth of good soil in their heart for the seed of truth to get a good root and a firm hold. During this year we have emphasized what dedication and baptism mean. It has been kept before all that the making of a vow to do God’s will is not the end of the matter, but rather it is the regular doing of that will by preaching that is the essential requirement. This year twenty-three were baptized. All took part in the service work and helped to give us our peak of fifty-seven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In October we held a three-day assembly here in Shanghai. The brothers are always happy to get together and almost all were able to get the full three days off to attend. The average attendance for all sessions was 96, and 129 attended the semipublic talk on Sunday. This was our largest attendance to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was five years ago that we received our last shipment of literature from the Society, so we were very much in need of the latest books, Bibles and booklets. At the end of the year we made an application for an import license to import a substantial quantity of the latest releases, and to our joy this was granted. The brothers were amazed and overjoyed to get all these latest Bibles, books and booklets in English and Chinese, and felt that Jehovah had ‘opened the windows of heaven and poured out a very big blessing.’ Especially glad were we to get the revised edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> in Chinese, for this book will be a fine instrument in the hands of the brothers when conducting home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have continued now about eight years isolated from our brothers in other lands. Even you, Brother Knorr, had to pass us by on your last two visits to this part of the earth, much to our regret, although we did enjoy reading the encouraging words you sent us while you were in Hong Kong. We know that Christ Jesus is the theocratic liaison officer who keeps all groups of the New World society bound together in unity. He is not hindered in the slightest by political or geographical obstacles in keeping all parts of the organization together as a whole. Through him we enjoy unity with our brothers in the spirit, even if not by physical contact. We are constantly reminded of the Lord’s presence with us in the daily protection we enjoy and in the regular supply of all our spiritual needs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark231"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Advancement in Colombia has been very good during the past year. We find there was an elevenpercent increase in publishers with a new peak of 719 publishers being reached in June, 1956. Many good things have been accomplished during the past twelve months. Another congregation was established in Barranquilla, bringing the total there to five. Throughout the country of Colombia five other new congregations were organized and ten more brothers were put on the special pioneer list. They now have a local brother as the circuit servant and 206 persons were baptized during the year. Outstanding was the purchase of a new branch and missionary home that the brothers obtained. This has made their hearts glad and undoubtedly from this new headquarters great expansion can be carried on. Obstacles are great at times but the brothers are never dismayed, for they know that Jehovah, who is with them, is far stronger than all the host that are against them. Our brothers in Colombia are a happy people with all of Jehovah’s witnesses the world over. Some of the interesting experiences that the branch servant sends in are recorded here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spite of numerous articles in U. S. newspapers and magazines during the past year regarding persecution of Protestants, closing down of churches, etc., Colombian papers continue to deny hotly such reports. Government circulars issued in 1954, prohibiting all door-to-door proselytizing activity by other than the Catholic religion, have been more strictly enforced recently. Jehovah’s witnesses have difficulties in carrying on their work here under such circumstances; nevertheless, they do so and the good work prospers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two special pioneers happily working in their new sheep-filled territory for three months suddenly found themselves in trouble. Why? Some ‘good Catholic’ schoolteachers lyingly told the priest that these “Protestants” talked against the pope and the Catholic religion and were corrupting the younger generation. The priest complained to the military mayor, who sent the police after them, and soon they were behind bars, sentenced to serve twenty-five days each for refusal to pay a fine. Meanwhile the pioneers took advantage of preaching to all those within reach. One evening a notorious robber listened carefully for three hours to the good news, stating that such news was like a melody to him. He became a loyal defender of the brother and protected him from rougher inmates. Many friends of good will on the outside came to the rescue of the pioneers, supplying them well with food and material needs. After establishing a new record of eleven days in jail, the pioneers were freed. They remained in their assignment but have been obliged to devote themselves almost exclusively to back-calls and Bible studies and have also arranged that many of the interested ones come to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font3"> home to receive private studies. Now the local interest show more concern about preparing themselves for future service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In ten years the branch office had been moved many times and now it would be necessary to move again as the home had been sold. It seemed impossible to find a suitable home to rent or one that could be more or less permanent. Then, after a diligent search, our “dream house” was found, but for sale, not for rent. That appeared to be beyond our reach; however, armed with hope and optimism, we were determined to try. A congregation committee presented the issue to the local congregations the following Sunday and it was received with hearty approval, the brothers agreeing to support it financially if the Society was interested in buying the property. The Society did approve. The brothers did their part and the house became ours in short order. But that was not all, by far. The family, good friends of local priests, did not wish to move. For 132 days after the purchase we had to suffer—watching them enjoy our new home. When patience and nerves were at an end they moved—or rather, we moved them. Then came the remodeling, construction and repairs throughout. A contractor was hired, brothers volunteered their services and an army of twenty workers went forward till all was complete from top to bottom and the new building had that theocratic look. We moved in on August 18 and the following day was the long-waited-for inauguration day. All local units were invited and readily attended. Joy was great and hopes were high for the assembly to be held here the succeeding week. We feeling that this was a local fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise to open the heavens and pour out blessings upon His people and being desirous of showing heartfelt gratitude for this grand provision of Jehovah, a resolution was adopted and sent to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now we feel firm, permanent and equipped as the new building houses the Society’s branch office and the local missionaries and affords ample space for a fine Kingdom Hall and room for local assemblies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">No matter where Jehovah’s witnesses are throughout the world Jehovah pours out his blessing, a blessing greater than anyone can contain. The experiences of the brothers in Costa Rica have been rich. While there was a slight increase in the number of active ministers, it was not great and they did not reach a new peak; however, they did not go backward. Some who had taken up the preaching work did not stick to it but returned to old-world living, but new ones have taken their place. This shows the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to look after those who have turned from the old world and who have come into the organization. They must be aided in every respect. We must bring them on to maturity and we cannot let those who have turned away from old-world living to the New World society drift back and lose their interest in the truth. Gains should be held, but Costa Rica has had a number of losses. The people of Costa Rica have a high rate of literacy in comparison with other Latin-American countries, but there is a great deal of religious fanaticism. Religious leaders have instructed their people to put signs in their windows saying that they do not want to have anyone come to them to talk about religion. However, Jehovah’s witnesses must ignore these announcements because their commission is from Jehovah God to preach the good news and comfort all that mourn, and so the work goes on. Religionists would shut up the kingdom of heaven before mankind; for they do not go in, nor do they permit others to enter. While the religionists want to keep the people blind, Jehovah’s witnesses want to open their eyes. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences that you will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the start of the service year a new branch home and Kingdom Hall were being constructed near the center of the capital city, San Jose. The Kingdom Hall then being used was very small and no longer adequately served the purposes of the expanding Kingdom activity. The new building is a modern, two-story brick-and-cement structure, with a large Kingdom Hall on the second floor and the branch office and a missionary home on the first floor. Word came from the office of the Society’s president that if the building could be ready by the end of January the president himself would be in Costa Rica for the dedication. The contractor was urged to speed up his work, and local brothers came in to help with the painting and carpentry work. After several weeks of their working day and night the building was occupied just two days before the scheduled dedication. Then on Friday night, January 27, Brother Knorr dedicated the building to be used in the service of Jehovah God. Shortly after that the film “The New World Society in Action” was presented for five consecutive nights and many people were able to appreciate the beauty and convenience of the new building. Then at the conclusion of a national assembly publishers from all over the country were invited to inspect the property. The brothers greatly appreciate this wonderful provision of Jehovah God through his visible organization. Just recently 550 attended a circuit assembly in the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s film continued to be used throughout the year with great success. A circuit servant obtained the use of a theater in a small village and announced the showing of the film for that night. However, the only policeman in the village did not like Jehovah’s witnesses and said that they could not present the film. After strengthening his courage at a local tavern he went to the theater just before the hour for the picture and threatened the circuit servant and the theater owner with his gun. Several of the townspeople had already congregated and they did not wish to be deprived of the opportunity of seeing the picture, so they disarmed the drunken policeman, locked him in a room until he was sober, and thoroughly enjoyed the film. Another night the circuit servant did not have time to rewind the film after a showing so the following evening he went to a home that had electricity to rewind the film. A group of people gathered and requested that the film be shown to them. When the count was taken eighty-seven were present at this unexpected presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Costa Rica has spread over the entire country. There are many rural congregations that must travel long distances on foot or horseback to preach the good news of the Kingdom. One circuit servant had to travel several hours on horseback and then take an eighteen-hour ride in a canoe in order to reach one congregation. The following day he started out with some of the brothers to cover some of this isolated congregation’s “isolated” territory. For six days they walked through jungle terrain, wading creeks, swamps and rivers, sleeping wherever they might be at nightfall, preaching to scattered homes, to small villages, giving public lectures where possible, and leaving more than a hundred pieces of Bible literature with the people. It takes real faith to preach under such circumstances, and these brothers have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In one village one of the most prominent men began to study with Jehovah’s witnesses because they discussed the Bible at his door. This greatly disturbed some of the more fanatical church members and they sent for a priest to come and stop the study, for this man was one of their financial mainstays. When the priest arrived the man asked why he had been singled out for this special attention, and said that there were many others that were studying with Jehovah’s witnesses but they hadn’t been visited. He wanted to know if it was because he happened to have a few more head of cattle. The priest was so enraged that he pronounced a curse on the man. But remembering Psalm 109:28 the man of good will was undismayed. Now some of the neighbors say that if the curse doesn’t work they are going to become Jehovah’s witnesses too.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In some countries it is difficult for people to make their lives over, especially when they have been trained under the Catholic organization, where anything goes. It is very common in Latin-American countries to find people living in fornication and adultery, and the Roman Catholic Church has always winked its eye at this. But in the New World society we cannot tolerate unclean living, and when it is discovered the people involved are disfellowshiped. Of course, in Cuba all of Jehovah’s witnesses have come from the Catholic organization itself, and too often they bring with them their unclean ideas and they do not see the importance of living according to the Word of God, which says you cannot commit fornication or adultery. During the year 122 persons were disfellowshiped for unclean living. This shows that the servants in the congregations are trying to keep the organization upright and clean and by example it will show the other brothers that if they want to attain to life in the new world they must make straight paths for their feet. There has been a decrease in the organization in Cuba as to the number of regular publishers. Now they have 9,342, and this is about 300 less than the previous year. The responsibility falls upon the overseers, the congregation servants, the circuit and district servants and those in the branch to set the right example always, so that those who have taken their stand on Jehovah’s side will remain in his organization and gain life. These will help the other sheep to come on to maturity and make their minds over. We sincerely hope that our brothers in Cuba will make the advances during the 1957 service year that are so common to Jehovah’s organization. The branch servant gives some very interesting experiences and they are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This year we have stressed working isolated territory, with excellent results. A circuit servant led a group of publishers in a mountainous region in isolated territory. He reports: “We started out on foot. On reaching a small mountain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pueblo</span><span class="font3"> we began working from house to house. Imagine our joy on finding a man who considered himself a witness and was witnessing to his neighbors in his own way. We encouraged him and helped him in the service. Our group spent two days and two nights in the mountains and left over 200 pieces of literature, including five subscriptions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking of obstacles, when the circuit servant arrived at the place where he was to give the public talk he was so exhausted from plodding through the mud and rain that he had to give the talk sitting down with his shoes off. Perhaps this is not so unusual for Cubans, but in some countries this would present quite a sight. This same brother tells us about having to swim a swollen river to fulfill a speaking engagement. Thus people of good will appreciate the seriousness given to our ministry. Rains, mud and poor transportation are hazards that all publishers, especially the traveling brothers, must face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are also other obstacles that are overcome by Jehovah’s help. During last April a circuit assembly was being held in the port city of Matanzas. The Devil was determined to wreck the success of that event. On Saturday a bloody revolution broke out a few blocks from the assembly auditorium, resulting in many being killed, though not one of the brothers was touched. Then a mob of about fifty fanatics beat up the congregation servant right in front of the auditorium. Many expected the government authorities to close the assembly immediately, but not a single session was missed. The assembly was a success and this month the mob leader must stand trial in the local court for his devilish action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year another incident took place that gave a good witness in so-called higher circles. A sister had been employed for more than twenty years in the Royal Bank of Canada, Havana branch. As secretary to the president of the branch she was one of the most efficient translators. Her resignation from such a financially secure position in order to go in the pioneer work came as a tremendous surprise to the bank officials. However, it increased their respect for the work and sincerity of Jehovah’s witnesses. At a farewell gathering in honor of this sister’s service to the bank one of the employees read the following message to the many present: “From time to time we get together to say good-by to fellow workers who retire. But this time it is something different and, as far as we know, the case is unique in the history of this bank in Cuba. Just at this time we hear of employees who are leaving their posts to occupy better positions with larger remuneration, in order to enjoy more comforts and material satisfaction. But in the case of our dear companion, the contrary is the case: she leaves behind what is dear to her, what has up to now been a source and could still be a source of material satisfaction. But the longing of her heart is on something much higher. She has found complete spiritual satisfaction answering the call of our Lord when he cries: ‘The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few,’ by saying: ‘Here am I; send me.’ We say: ‘Emma, may God bless you in your endeavors, Jehovah is your Shepherd. He will accompany you and you will not want.’ ” Certainly no financial security can equal the blessings poured down from God’s throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our three district assemblies in July resulted in a splendid attendance on Sunday of over 6,500. More than 4,800 on Saturday night enthusiastically voiced agreement to send the special petition to Russia in behalf of our brothers there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses on Cyprus can reflect on the past year and rehearse their blessings. They have found Jehovah’s favor while they live in a very troublesome part of the world. As far as the old world is concerned Cyprus has passed one of its most horrible years, which will go down in history as a black spot long remembered. Cyprus has witnessed violence, bloodshed, murder and more murder, bans, curfews and a host of other restrictions. This is the way the old system of things has to operate when all kinds of trouble exist. But among Jehovah’s people brotherly love reigns and they carry on their work as before except that the worldly restrictions put certain bounds upon their witnessing. It has been difficult for them to conduct meetings regularly, especially home Bible studies, and we find in their report that this feature of the service has decreased because of curfews. However, there was a slight increase in the number of publishers in the field this year over last year, despite all the difficulties. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The year was one of uncertainty. Arrangements made for meetings and field service had to be canceled time and time again, as terrorist attacks brought curfews and other restrictions. Meetings had to be held during the day and on weekends when the brothers were free. This hampered the hours they could spend in field service, and the back-call and home Bible study activity were particularly affected during the hours of darkness. There were times when curfews kept the brothers inside their homes as much as four days at a stretch. Every man became suspicious of his neighbor, with the result that people would not open their mouths to express any idea or opinion at all. The old world’s supporters may have been silenced through fear, but not so the bearers of the good news. They have had many opportunities during the year to witness to “high and low,” to men of “all kinds.” You will see this from the following experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At a circuit assembly held during the year many obstacles had to be overcome, but with happy results. Because of the almost continuous curfews in the towns it was decided to hold our assembly in a village where there is a large congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. That meant building our own assembly hall and place for cafeteria. Preparations started a week prior to the assembly and work had already been started when, on the Sunday before the assembly was due to commence, terrorists got busy on the outskirts of the village. An English soldier was shot dead and another was seriously wounded, with the result that the assembly village was placed under curfew and all people confined indoors. The question now was, Shall we be able to hold the assembly? Early on Monday morning all the male inhabitants were rounded up. This included the branch servant and the circuit servant, who were already in the village. All were put in a barbed-wire enclosure for interrogation and screening. This was a lengthy process, so the brothers had to wait seven hours in the burning sun before their turn came. The branch servant, being English, was able to give a good witness concerning Jehovah’s witnesses to the officers in charge of the interrogation and was able to speak on behalf of the other brothers in the village. He was released after nine hours’ detention, but the circuit servant and the other Cypriote brothers had to remain outside all night in a barbed-wire enclosure and were released on Tuesday. With the lifting of the curfew on Tuesday evening the brothers went ahead with the preparations for the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers thought that this incident would have a bad effect on the assembly and that some persons might be frightened from attending. However, to our joy the radio, when announcing the shooting incident in the village, gave the wrong name of the village, so this was in our favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a curfew on in one town that has a large congregation and it was felt that they would not be able to attend the assembly. However, the curfew was lifted at noon on Friday and within an hour the brothers had completed arrangements and were all ready to make the trip to the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A high light of the assembly was the immersion, where seventeen symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. Strange as it may seem, the immersion took place at the same spot where the terrorists had shot the English soldiers the previous Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the turmoil of the past year many honest people in the island have had their eyes opened to see the duplicity of the Greek Orthodox Church and its clergy. The church has meddled in politics and has associated itself with the terrorist organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many of the islanders have leanings toward communism, but their hopes have been shattered in that ideology because of the many about-turns that it has made during the past year. A young man in a village coffee shop was heard to pass the following remark while the witnesses were witnessing in the village: &quot;Now that we see that the priests and communism have failed us, it is high time for us to think seriously about the matter and become Jehovah’s witnesses.” So we see that as events move along, people who love righteousness are able to discern more clearly the true religion and its representatives.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Our brothers in Czechoslovakia are grateful to Jehovah God for his guidance, protection and the strength that he has given them throughout the past year. Through his organization he has seen to it that spiritual food has been provided for them. Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia are still organized, probably even better than before, but the government through its spies and agents of destruction is trying to break down the unity of Jehovah’s witnesses. They use brutal methods of violence, imprisonment, and by sly practices and tactics try to penetrate into the organization itself so as to be a part of it. The communistic government is disturbed about the continually running water of truth, and they very much dislike to see Jehovah’s witnesses stand firm to their covenant and perform their duties as Christians. The enemy continually tries to frighten Jehovah’s witnesses and is always ready to deprive them of any liberties they have. The Communist government that claims to be the lover of the people and that claims to have gained the natural rights for the people by its revolutionary achievements is forcing all people into idolatry of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Information comes out of Czechoslovakia to this effect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the help of informers the enemy succeeded in interfering with the meetings and service of the congregations. They caused a number of the members of congregations to flee, but they have all rallied and the publishers of the Kingdom have come back and are re-established in the New World society. In the Memorial month Jehovah’s witnesses reached the highest number of publishers and conducted the greatest number of home Bible studies, not only in the past service year, as an all-time high for the brothers in Czechoslovakia. We trust that with Jehovah’s blessing we may further progress with the witness work despite all obstacles, doing this in unity of spirit with the faithful and discreet slave whom the Almighty uses as His rightful servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In April Jehovah’s witnesses were offered the possibility of meeting openly in one circuit, but we would have to make some concessions. The Communists said that the past would be forgotten. The whole move of the Communists was to divide up Jehovah’s witnesses, to cut one section off from another, to adulterate the truth in such a way that it would be palatable to Caesar, but, of course, then it would not be palatable to Jehovah’s servants. The Communists proved themselves to be unreliable, as they always have been, for in June they sentenced some more of Jehovah’s witnesses to long terms in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very recently the authorities approached Jehovah’s witnesses concerning the eventual reregistration of our organization, which led the brothers in Czechoslovakia to petition the Ministry of the Interior on August 1, 1956, to admit our activity legally again. It is understood that this matter is now being examined and that there may be further discussions soon. The authorities have been clearly informed about the stand of Jehovah’s witnesses, both in oral and written form, and their having had to deal with us for many years should have shown them that Jehovah’s witnesses will not compromise, but will stick to theocratic principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Communist organization is trying to get everyone it can into the military service, and when Jehovah’s witnesses express their conscientious objection to war they are either sent home to think it over and return or charged with violating the law and sentenced to prison. The punishment for refusing to do military service for reasons of conscience varies from one year to two years in prison. Some of Jehovah’s witnesses are in prison now because of their conscientious objection to war. There are many persons in Czechoslovakia that would like to harm Jehovah’s witnesses by turning ‘informer.’ They try to work their way into the organization and get information about Jehovah’s witnesses so that they can turn it over to the government, and this has caused trouble within the organization. However, despite these difficulties we rejoice in the privilege of serving Jehovah of Hosts and his Son, Jesus Christ. The fulfillment of divine prophecy, the nearness of the day of complete deliverance and the light shining from the temple strengthen our hearts and fill us with joy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark are a large organization compared with the population. However, this year we find no increase as far as numbers of publishers are concerned. Far more than a thousand were baptized during the year, but that does not show up on the final figures. It is true that the publishers have grown stronger and more mature in their faith and service, but, on the other hand, there are disturbing factors within Denmark that have taken some away. Some would like to have all the blessings of the Kingdom without going out in the service and preaching it. They want to live in the new world, but they do not want to preach in the old world and go through the persecutions and trials that are necessary in proving Christian faith. There is a real blessing in store for all those who exert themselves and follow Jehovah’s counsel. The publishers in Denmark who are faithful are not happy that they could not show an increase in publishers praising Jehovah’s name, but they are, for the most part, stronger and more determined than ever to exert themselves during the coming year in order to strengthen the weak ones that may have stepped aside. The spiritual feeding program must go on in all parts of the earth, including Denmark. The brothers there are very happy about the construction of a new Bethel home and printery, and the branch servant gives us some very interesting high lights of what has taken place in the land during the past year. He also reports on other territories under the jurisdiction of the Danish branch, namely, the Faroe Islands and Greenland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus said, “Exert yourselves vigorously to get in through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will seek to get in but will not be strong enough.” In Denmark during the past year many publishers have exerted themselves and have used the training program, Bible sermons, magazine work and the good spiritual counsel from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> as a means of growing stronger. But others did not want to exert themselves; they failed to use the strength-giving provisions and became tired, letting the weeds and thorns of materialism, family and other cares of this life choke off their growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a small congregation in west Jutland the three publishers were timid about working in their own village, as is often the case. But when the circuit servant visited them he managed to get the three of them on Sunday to work with him in their own village instead of going off to another area. Instead of the cold reception they just ‘knew’ they would get, they were surprised when one publisher placed many magazines and another obtained three subscriptions a short distance down the street from the home where the public talk was to be held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> continues to prove a vital instrument for bringing readers along into the truth. In March of this year the district servant obtained a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">subscription from a man. After reading several issues he was convinced it was the truth and wrote to the office for more literature. This was sent and the office wrote the congregation to visit him. He progressed rapidly with further help and in July he was baptized at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pioneer made several back-calls on a woman but could never start a study. When the pioneer had to leave the district for six months the woman became a subscriber for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> When the pioneer returned, the magazine had done its work. Each issue had been thoroughly read and the woman was ready for a study. She has now been baptized and delights to take this fine magazine to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also, there was the elderly doctor who has long been interested in the causes for unhappiness that bring so much illness. He wrote to a sister: “Thank you for the interesting magazines, especially the one on gossip. It is the most instructive and exhaustive treatment I have ever read. I would like a supply of these to give others this vital information on that leprous sickness, gossip, the most contagious and death-dealing sickness I know of.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tact enabled a publisher to help a family of devout believers in faith healing. By concentrating first on subjects where they agreed, ‘the last days,’ ‘the end of the world,’ ‘the new earth,’ the publisher built up their knowledge and confidence. When the issue of faith healing finally was discussed the entire family were convinced. One after another they began to take their stand, including the father, who began with the special distribution of the April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and since then has been a regular publisher though he is eighty years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While in prison for maintaining their neutrality two young brothers obtained permission to hold their </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study in the dining hall. Others walking through stopped to listen and eventually six or seven began to attend. Discussions grew until finally the brothers were giving talks to from fifteen to twenty. Although the warden soon stopped this, other opportunities were used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though prohibited from preaching they can defend their beliefs, and, doing this, one brother while barber-ing gave quite a witness in another section of the prison. Two who at first opposed became quite interested, but they were released shortly thereafter. The brother, later freed, accidentally ran into one of the men on the street and started a study with him. Now both he and his wife are publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The year’s high point was the all-Denmark assembly held in Aarhus Stadium amid beautiful park surroundings. The grounds included a place for camping, and about 3,000 brothers lived in 800 tents during the assembly. When the assembly was planned the tourist bureau said it would be impossible to provide enough hotel accommodations in July and Aarhus residents were too reserved to list rooms with us. It was just the opposite. The people responded with an average of one accommodation an hour, so the 3,000 private home accommodations were soon obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The assembly’s climax was the resolution to Russia, unanimously adopted by 8,277 publishers. This resolution was reported, in substance, in some twenty-eight newspapers throughout Denmark, with a total circulation of over 665,000, quite a good coverage for a land of little over four million. Extensive advertising was also carried on so that on Sunday there were 10,009 for the public talk. All present returned home impressed by the seriousness, directness and timeliness of the talks.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>FAROE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">These islands are battered by winds and the ocean, with ever-changing weather that can interfere with all man-made plans for traveling, fishing, working or even walking to town. It is the sort of thing that enforces patience, that teaches one that the scheduled going to and fro of our civilized world is not always so important as it seems. The people who live here are used to it and they take life as it comes. Generally, they have reacted slowly to anything new, but now their interest is being awakened in many new things, including the hope of the new world. It takes them a little longer than some to react to the new and unfamiliar ideas of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One brother from Copenhagen decided to travel here for his vacation pioneering. On one of his first days up here he began talking to a woman at the door. In spite of all his efforts to get her to say something, he could not get any response whatsoever during the entire eight minutes of his talk. Feeling she had not listened, he proceeded to try a sermon on another subject that took fifteen minutes. In getting to the presentation of literature, he said: “Well, I don’t want to take any more of your time now, so I want to show you some books I have and you can read them when convenient.” She replied: “Oh, I have enough time to listen.” Somewhat taken aback, he proceeded on yet a third sermon, re-explaining many points of truth, and after a total of nearly forty-five minutes he presented three books and managed to place one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day while working a very isolated area the pioneers contacted an old man who had subscribed years before for both magazines. Through reading these he had gained a good understanding and he welcomed the pioneers and talked with them as a brother. He was interested in the growth of the New World society and it was only for a lack of money that he did not sail to Denmark for the assembly in July.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark238"></a>GREENLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Sukkertoppen, Qutdlingssat, Umanak, Mamorilik. These are names of some of the dozens of villages visited a number of times by the two missionaries in Greenland during the past year. Much literature has been distributed, many back-calls have been made to build up the interest and nearly 1,600 have seen the film. All this has been accomplished under difficulties of bad weather, poor boat service and harassment by opposers. Sometimes the brothers waited many days for a boat only to find there was no space, or to have the captain refuse passage because they were not members of the Danish church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finding living accommodations during their stay in the villages has often been a problem. At one place, after spending a cold night in a woodshed, they were going from house to house when they met a Green-landic woman who had heard of their lodging problem. She said: “My brother and I think it is a shame for you to sleep in a woodshed. You must move into my brother’s house and I will cook food for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The film showings have been talked about from one end of Greenland to the other, having given a good picture of the international aspect of the organization. Being accustomed to the sprinkling of babies only, they have been much amazed at the full water immersion for adults that they saw on the film. As a result, some lost interest while others have inquired further into this matter, impractical as it seems to the Greenlandic mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some clergy opposition has been carried on extensively against Jehovah’s witnesses and the use of the name Jehovah. Neither the Danish nor the presently used Greenlandic Bible uses Jehovah’s name and it was not always easy to explain this to the people. However, one day the brothers managed to obtain from a man an old translation of the Greenlandic Bible published in 1820, where Jehovah’s name is used, and this has been helpful in identifying the true God and showing all the blessings and purposes of God to come in connection with the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses who live in countries where freedom still rings cannot realize the full privilege that is theirs. The privilege of going from house to house, not being molested, not being followed by police and not having your nerves strained to the limit is not deeply appreciated. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Dominican Republic for a number of years have lived through the hard times aforementioned, but this did not slow them down. In 1950 when the ban was placed on all of Jehovah’s witnesses and they were forbidden to preach the good news there were 217 in the truth. At the beginning of the service year, 1956, there were 469. There was little thought in the minds of those publishers in the Dominican Republic that the work would increase during this particular year while still under the ban. But each month the branch saw reports showing increases, 481 in November, 506 in December and by June 563 out in the field service work. Yes, it was all done quietly, but the ministers of God were carrying on studies of the Bible and doing house-to-house witnessing. Then at the end of the year, as though in reward for faithful service, the ban was lifted! The best way to tell you about the joy and gladness of heart is to quote from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fifteenth and sixteenth of August were holidays; then on Friday the morning paper carried the two-column announcement that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses was declared legal and they would have complete freedom to operate in the country. It was unbelievable, but there it was. The night paper carried the same statement, or rather a resolution abolishing the former law prohibiting the work. The reaction on the friends was interesting to see. Almost all the Latins are enthusiastic and made the most of the announcement. One brother dusted off his book bag, stuffed in a Bible and books and with the paper in one hand jumped on his bicycle and rode through the little town where he lives, saying: “The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is free, the work is free!” His wife ran out the back door shouting the same thing to the neighbors. Another brother’s comment was: “I’m going right home to dig up the books that I had buried under the living-room floor.” Another brother put on the magazine bag and dug up an old magazine and started visiting the friends and persons of good will. The friends went visiting one another, hugging, shouting, and dancing around with joy. Many persons who were not associated with the witnesses in any way were glad to see us free again, too, and came and congratulated us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A few of the more reserved brothers and some of the missionaries just could not believe it and wanted more proof that it was true. It was like the case of Thomas, who doubted the resurrection of Jesus. Thomas wanted more proof. The Lord did not hold it against him for wanting to feel the body of Jesus for proof, but he just missed the joy of the other apostles who believed without doubting. It did not mean either that Thomas was less faithful. He just missed the joy of the moment that never could be recaptured. The majority here were joyful without asking for proof and it was a time I should never like to forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the end of the second week after the ban servants had been appointed, one Kingdom Hall here in the capital was operating and the others were meeting provisionally in yards or on rooftops. The second Sunday after the ban was lifted 234 met in the capital in three groups. One group met in its Kingdom Hall, another of over a hundred met on the roof of an apartment house and the third was in the back yard of a brother’s home. Naturally, everybody was thrilled and overflowing with thanks to Jehovah for his deliverance from the enslaved position we had under the ban. We are glad that the government saw fit to permit us to operate with freedom again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the ban came on the work in 1950 we had 217 and a month later dropped to 133 publishers, but like the Israelites in Egypt, we increased in numbers. In 1956 we reached a peak of 563 under the ban and hope to find many more of good will, now that the work is opened. If the officials continue their friendly attitude toward our work, I am sure the Lord will bless them too with peace and prosperity in seeking the Kingdom and its blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is time to roll up our sleeves and get to work. All the brothers here want the brothers in the rest of the world to know that we are grateful to the Lord for his blessings and privileges and that we are shoulder to shoulder with you all in serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The ministers serving the Kingdom interests in Ecuador have been reading in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> about choosing a career with the New World society by becoming full-time ministers of the good news. This encouragement has shown results in Ecuador. Quite a few during the year have taken up the ministry, entering special pioneer service as well as the pioneer work, and the results are very gratifying. Ecuador shows an increase of fourteen percent in the average publishers, and twenty-seven percent in their peak. They now have 336 publishers, with good prospects for the coming year. A good bit of isolated territory has been worked by these special pioneers, and they have done a wonderful service in expanding the preaching activity in the country. Many new territories have been opened up, and now there are good prospects for forming some new congregations. So far in Ecuador there are ten congregations in different parts of the country. From the lowland along the principal river to the high mountains the witness has been given. The branch servant gives us some interesting reports of this isolated work and readers of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font4"> will enjoy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not at all unusual for us to find opposition when the work opens up in new territories; nor is it unusual for us to find that this boomerangs and results in blessings. Two of our special pioneers were assigned to work in the area that is the home of the Otavalefio Indians. Many of the grown-up people of this tribe speak only their own language, Quechua, which the brothers do not understand, but usually there are children in the family who speak both Quechua and Spanish and these youngsters are happy to act as interpreters so that their parents can converse with the brothers about Jehovah’s kingdom. In this area the pioneers found many people who had previously studied the Bible with Protestant pastors, who later abandoned them in face of opposition, just like the “hired man” of Jesus’ illustration. Now these humble people have renewed their Bible studies with associates of the Right Shepherd, who have no fear of the “wolf.” Very soon after the brothers began work in the territory, the local newspaper, aided by the radio station and dominated by the prominent Catholic religion, published several articles telling the people not to accept their &quot;heresy.” One article even described the appearance of the brothers and told where they could be found displaying the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines on the street and this aroused so much curiosity that even the Catholic priests began to study the Society’s literature to see what it was all about. One priest was approached by one of his parishioners who had taken the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> and wanted to know whether he might study it with the person who had brought it to his home. The priest recommended the book for its high moral value and the study continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While going from house to house one of the special pioneers placed a booklet in a home and when he passed on to the next a young woman rushed into the house to remind the owner that he was an evangelist. In the meantime three booklets had been placed at the next home, but when the first householder interrupted to return her own booklet, the second also wanted to do the same. An observer who had been standing nearby then joined the conversation and said that he would like to have one of the booklets; another young man approached with the same request, followed by a woman who wished to have a third one. The first man pointed to a house on the other side of the street and told the brother: “That is my house; you are welcome to come in whenever you feel like it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another case brought similar results when a young sister, who is also a special pioneer, returned to make a back-call on a man who had taken from her the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”.</span><span class="font3"> The man met her at the door with the soiled book and demanded his money back. When the sister tried to reason with him he quickly brandished his machete and threatened her with its ugly blade, until some others forcibly held him back. An observer advised the sister to take the matter to the authorities, so she made her way to the office of the commissary to lodge a complaint. The commissary not only attended to the complaint, but he took the book for himself, together with two magazines, and asked the sister to call with the magazines every two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines are certainly doing a wonderful part in publicizing Jehovah’s name and his people. The special campaign in April lent great impetus to the magazine work, and the placements keep increasing little by little. The magazines are very well known, especially in the coastal areas. One brother who had just returned from a vacation in the United States was boarding one of Guayaquil’s fast-moving buses when a man rushed up behind him to ask, “Do you have the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> there?” “That surely didn’t happen to me in the States,” said the brother.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> This is what Jehovah’s witnesses want to do every day in the land of Egypt. Egypt is spoken of much in the Bible and even today the witness is given there to the rulers and the people. While many hardships arise, still at the close of the year the faithful servants of Jehovah God can cry out and say that the windows of heaven were opened and abundant blessings were poured forth upon them, even more than they could contain. Being one of Jehovah’s witnesses is not the easiest thing to do in the world, but the lot of Jehovah’s people and the experience they had last year reminds one of the psalmist’s words: “May those who sow in tears reap with shouts of joy.” The branch servant in Egypt gives us a very interesting account of what happened in that land and also in the Sudan. Excerpts of his report are printed herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the service year began the work was not considered favorably and the witnesses were not allowed to use their Kingdom Halls, but they were determined to fight for their rights and carry on their Christian work of vital education. When Brother Henschel visited Cairo last September (1955) contacts were made with various officials, including an interview with the minister of interior. Shortly afterward the minister instructed that we be allowed to operate, deciding not to give ear to the clergy’s slander that we are promoting Zionistic propaganda. This meant that we could use again the Kingdom Hall at Cairo. The zeal of the brothers, far from cooling off during the short period</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of test, had increased. Expansion was in view, so two walls were demolished at the Kingdom Hall, making two big rooms out of four. Brothers were very happy to be able to meet again and invite good-will people to their public place of meeting and worship. Meeting attendance went on the increase and so did the number of publishers, reaching a peak of 153 in August, to compare with 110 for the same month last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the meantime, a legal fight was going on to get government recognition for the Alexandria congregation. This was crowned with success, and on September 21 to 23 a three-day meeting was arranged to inaugurate the use of the Kingdom Hall for the first time in three years. A peak attendance was reached on Sunday, with 145 listening to the final service talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A district assembly was held in Cairo on September 6 to 9 of this year and it proved to be a great blessing to all. It was, in fact, the first assembly we were able to hold during the past two years, and the best we had so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its efforts to annul the good effects of our pastoral work, the Catholic Church sent a priest to fight the witnesses. He goes around boasting he is the church-appointed one to combat us. He follows the brothers in the homes where they hold back-calls and Bible studies to take away from the sheeplike ones the seed of truth being implanted in them. But how miserably does he fail! He went one night to a Bible study and acted in such a way, slandering and bitterly criticizing, that the housewife said she was sorry he came and explained that she had not invited him. “After all,” she said, “I know he is a good comedian.” The husband disliked very much the continual attack and slander of the priest and said he was unfit to be a minister. Although he claimed at the start that he was an atheist, he has followed the study regularly and has come twice to the Kingdom Hall since the priest’s visit. He has expressed his assurance that he was on the right road and recently started attending congregation meetings. His wife talks about the truth to all her relatives and friends and her son also follows the home Bible study attentively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While we show neighbor love to persons we never knew before, we do not forget our close neighbors: our relatives and acquaintances. It happened that a young man left Egypt for Greece and there he took his stand for the truth. But he wanted his parents in Egypt to learn about it too. So he arranged for a call to be made at their home and told them about it. The call was made, a friendly Bible discussion ensued and a return visit was arranged. Then the sister-in-law and the neighbor showed sheeplike qualities and a study was started, although the father and the mother showed little interest. In course of time the neighbor’s son also joined in the study and now the three of them are baptized publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>SUDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Very little has been done in the Sudan in regard to Kingdom preaching. Few among the ten million people living there have ever heard about the New World hope. With the exception of Khartoum, Port Sudan and Wad Medani, all of the Sudan is strictly virgin territory. Jesus’ words: “The harvest is great, but the workers are few,” are particularly true regarding this country. In its vast area of 967,500 square miles are found twelve publishers acting as light-bearers in the city of Khartoum, Sudan’s capital. I had the privilege of visiting the brothers there last June and working on the Society’s registration. The case is moving, though slowly, but we do hope to get government recognition, which might open the way for mature ministers to give a helping hand. For the first time the Sudan government granted a representative of the Society a visa to pay an official visit to our people. I was able to take with me the film “The New World Society in Action” and it was shown twice, after government censorship and approval, to a total attendance of fifty-nine persons. It was also possible to get a Gilead graduate into the country and keep him there for six months, which was of much help to the brothers and those of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Unusual things have happened in El Salvador in the way of reaching the people with the truth during the past year. Again, the congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in this little country in Central America has increased by ten percent and they reached a new peak of 382 publishers. Of course, this number of publishers is very insufficient for covering the territory, but at least they make themselves known and the truth is heard. Here as in other parts of the world the harvest is great, but the workers are few, but the few workers that are there are doing quite well. The branch servant gives us some experiences that made the year in El Salvador an unusual one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A growing problem in El Salvador is the primitive, isolated rural population; of course, the problem to us is, How do we reach these persons? Isolated as they are in their mountain valleys, they have very narrow and extreme religious views; most of them are of Pentecostal sects, and they keep their minds as inaccessible to the truth as are their settlements from the outside world. How could we get the message of the Kingdom to them in a way they would be able to understand and accept? It was decided that “The New World Society in Action” was the answer, and so the circuit servant packed the film back into territory where cars had never been. The film was condemned by the local “pastor” as soon as it was announced, but a few hundred Catholics saw the film anyway, while a few of the Pentecostals braved their “pastor’s” anger in order to watch the film quietly from the shadows. Everyone wanted another showing of the film the next night, but by this time all in the Pentecostal church had heard how good it was, and they all attended. The preacher, who was left alone at the special prayer meeting he had called, finally gave in to curiosity and attended too. He clapped his hands as loudly as the rest did. They named our circuit servant Mr. Love, because they couldn’t pronounce his Norwegian name and because they saw so much love in the film. The name caught on, and there was nothing for him to do but answer to “Mr. Love.” The people told him one by one after the film: “This is the best religion!” There were many, many more similar experiences with the film during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Something very unusual happened at the branch home. A very religious “pastor” who had organized two small independent &quot;churches” called to say that he wanted to deliver these “churches”—congregation, benches, hall and name—to Jehovah’s witnesses. He was angry with certain foreign faith-healers who had put on a great healing campaign in an effort to concentrate all of the Pentecostal-type of religion under one sponsorship, which they called the “Assemblies of God.” Well, as the “pastor” explained, this kind of religion on a wholesale scale had badly hurt the “little man.” He explained that the independent “pastor” no longer could meet expenses, and he was convinced that it was not even a Christian practice, so the worst thing he could think of in the way of revenge against this religious monopoly was to turn his work over to Jehovah’s witnesses. He even said that he would like to become one of us. After a couple of Sundays of giving Bible talks and answering questions, the minister of Jehovah’s witnesses enrolled most of the men in the theocratic ministry school program and proceeded to follow the schedule as if it were a Kingdom Hall. Thirty to thirty-five attend each Sunday, and as soon as the basic doctrines are mastered the present </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> study will be turned into the regular study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font3"> however, the final outcome will have to be reported in next year’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark244"></a>ETHIOPIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The film “The New World Society in Action” has played a large part in turning the minds of the people to the New World society. It has taken something like this to arouse the interest of the people and many have been inquiring as to what this organization has that makes Jehovah’s witnesses so happy. Ethiopia had a very fine increase in publishers during the past year despite the opposition and trouble in carrying on the work there. Additionally, it is excellent to be able to report that the brothers in Ethiopia have been able to open up a new field in Eritrea. Some of Jehovah’s witnesses found it advisable to change territories because of climate and it has been most profitable, because these mature brothers have been able to gather together some of the other sheep in Eritrea. The branch report from Ethiopia, which branch also looks after Eritrea, is very interesting and you will enjoy the experiences reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During Brother Henschel’s visit and as a feature of our Triumphant Kingdom assembly we arranged to show the film at Ethiopia’s largest cinema, the Cinema Ethiopia, right in the main square of Addis Ababa. Posters were put up in all busy sections of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About an hour before the Amharic showing was to begin several of the brothers went to the Cinema Ethiopia, to find hundreds of people already trying to get in. Local publishers had their hands full holding back the huge crowd until police help arrived and then even the police had all they could do to cope with the eager people. When the doors were opened, a flood of humanity poured into the building, taking up every one of the nine hundred available seats within a few minutes’ time. Another one hundred stood in the aisles and still more waited at the entrance, as there were no more seats. This was certainly more than we had expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The police continually reminded those standing outside that the film would be shown again on the same evening and that they could return at that time. At the conclusion of the Amharic showing, a thousand people streamed out into the streets, each one with a booklet and an invitation to the next evening’s public talk, “World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom,” in his hand. The joy of getting booklets and invitations to all the people proved to be too great a job for the brothers assigned, so the police lent a helping hand, moving through the crowds giving a booklet to each and all. Their assistance was a welcome aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After a few minutes in went the crowd for the second showing, this time in English. An international audience of six hundred attentively watched the film, making a grand total of 1,600 to see the film in one evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following the instructions from your office more special pioneers were enrolled and a local circuit servant was appointed to care better for the interest in the interior and to open up the preaching work in remote parts of Ethiopia. In many cases the results of their work have been very fruitful. One town in particular has seen a rapid expansion of the preaching activity. The first of May a special pioneer with his wife and baby was sent to this town to be the first minister of Jehovah’s witnesses to preach there. The end of the second month found a total of nine active preachers in this town, where two months before there had been none. A peak of fifteen was reached during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we received our own projector, this was the first town in the interior to be visited. When I arrived there we were able to arrange a showing in the municipality hall. As soon as it became dark people started to come. We had the children sit on the straw-covered dirt floor in front, quickly filled up the benches, and had the rest stand. At 7 p.m. the electricity came on and I started the film, showing it on my bed sheet, which was tacked up as a screen on the mud wall. For some it was the first time in their lives to see a moving picture and the “Oh’s” and “Ah’s” were clearly audible. As “The Happiness of the New World Society” was revealed to them, a count showed that 450 had come to witness this film. And that without public advertising and in a town where four months before there had not been a single witness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next stop of the trip was at Gondar, the ancient capital of Ethiopia. Here there was not a single local congregation publisher reporting. But we rented an old, Italian-built cinema house, spread the word around about the film showings to all we could meet in the short space of one morning and then showed both films to an audience of 465 in the afternoon and 600 at night.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>ERITREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">For several years the Society has made a constant effort to spread Jehovah’s kingdom message in the land of Eritrea. From time to time local brothers from Ethiopia moved to Eritrea for secular work, but no real organized preaching was done. During this year an Ethiopian publisher was transferred to Asmara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The former Ethiopian branch servant and his wife had to leave Ethiopia’s high altitude for health reasons and were pleased to start special pioneer work in Asmara in May. Along with them, two local special pioneers were assigned and organized service was immediately begun. To the joy of these brothers, consecutive peaks in publishers have been manifested each month, bringing the first service year of organized activity to a close with a peak of thirteen publishers as the first congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses in the history of Eritrea was established in the capital city of Asmara.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the opening up of this new assignment many teachers and students from various Protestant missions have become curious and have started to ask questions. In these few months our brothers in Eritrea have held studies with over fifty teachers and students from several different missions, with a number of them showing genuine interest in the truth. Already two of these mission teachers have shared in house-to-house preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was a real joy to visit these brothers toward the close of the service year and show the Society’s films. A peak of sixty assembled for the showings at the newly established Kingdom Hall. Seeing these films has brought this new congregation closer to their brothers in other parts of the world and has helped to increase their appreciation for the “happy” organization of Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Finland continue to grow in maturity, and they have found that the magazines </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> play a big part in helping the other sheep gain a knowledge of the truth. They have had a wonderful increase in the distribution of magazines, and undoubtedly 1957 will prove to be even more successful. Many years ago the Finnish brothers established their own printing plant to turn out their own publications, and it is necessary now to print in large quantities. On the average, there have been about a hundred more publishers in the field than in the previous year, and they have done well in covering their territory. It is a cold land and many obstacles have to be met, but they keep at the witnessing work with good effort. The branch servant has sent in some very interesting experiences and some of these are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the house-to-house magazine work in Helsinki a publisher met a man who seemed opposed to our work and started to put forth his own ideas about the Bible and religion. The publisher used his Bible and refuted the arguments and placed the magazines. In calling back the publisher found the man’s wife more interested and after a few back-calls a home Bible study was started. The housewife became sincerely interested in the truth, was invited to congregation meetings and started to attend right away. In spite of her sickness she studied zealously, made splendid progress and helped both of her daughters (aged eleven and seven) to study and come to meetings. Soon all three started to take part in house-to-house work. The opposition of the father has been broken down and the dedicated mother and older daughter now teach and encourage the interested father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A forester who had subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">was so impressed with his first issue that he started to doubt his former religious beliefs. After three months of studying with a pioneer he has received a good knowledge of the truth. He at once started to ask questions about the organization and activity of the New World society. When he noticed an announcement in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> about the district assembly he planned his vacation so as to be able to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A single copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> was placed with the lady of the house in a well-to-do area. After a couple of weeks a back-call was made, but this time the maid came to the door and expressed interest. She confessed that the lady of the house had thrown the magazine into the wastepaper basket but that she had picked it up and read it and was enthusiastic about the articles. The publisher placed more literature with the young woman, who was a hungry sheep. Although she was planning to get married in a couple of months, still she asked the publisher to help her study the Bible and a home Bible study was held twice a week. When she moved into her new home in another town she contacted the witnesses there and the study continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sickness or old age will not stop a witness who is determined to preach. One seventy-four-year-old pioneer was confined to bed during the cold winter. Unable to get out and continue his work from house to house this brother made wise use of the telephone and called all of his friends and interested ones, witnessing to them and suggesting that they subscribe for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font3">Imagine his joy and blessings when he obtained thirty-five new subscriptions during the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Finnish prisoner of war was released after seven years of imprisonment in Russia, after his relatives thought him to be dead. When he came home his first question was, “Are there any of Jehovah’s witnesses around here?” He had found faith in a Russian prison camp! He went to several homes of the witnesses and found none of them at home. Immediately he wondered ‘have the police taken them?’ All of the witnesses were attending an assembly in another city. When he found out that freedom still existed in Finland he wanted to travel to the assembly but did not have money. Before the local witnesses returned home he had received a letter from his brother in Sweden, who had a job for him, so he went to Sweden immediately but left word that the Finnish brothers should write him. They did and received a heartfelt letter to his brothers and sisters in Finland. He explained that he had learned the truth from an Esthonian brother with whom he studied a Russian Bible in prison. Thus the &quot;bread” was not so easily digested, but he was overjoyed to receive the truth in the difficult conditions of the Vorkuta slave labor camp. He asked the Finnish brothers to send him some literature, mentioning the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. </span><span class="font3">The latest publication of the Society that he had seen mentioned this book. Of course, the brothers in Finland sent him the latest book and booklets along with the Finnish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Arriving in Sweden, he immediately started a home Bible study with his fleshly brother. Four and a half months later his brother was immersed at a circuit assembly. Both are regular publishers of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark247"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The French-speaking world is big, but the branch office in Paris keeps in communication with many parts of it. It is the Society’s purpose to try to serve all of these places through circuit servants or special representatives, because we know that the assembling together of Jehovah’s people is the thing that strengthens them. Many wonderful experiences have been enjoyed by the witnesses in France, Algeria, Cameroun, Morocco, the Saar, Senegal and Tunisia. The branch servant at Paris makes a report on all of these countries. You will enjoy these experiences, for you will see the advancement of the Kingdom work. Not all the experiences can be published, but those that are will bring joy to your hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A person of good will handed in her name to be called on at her home after having attended an assembly in Paris. A zealous pioneer called to see this lady and it was evident from the beginning that she was really interested. A study was arranged and was conducted faithfully for several weeks, to the joy of this lady and her two children. One evening when the pioneer called to conduct the study she was met at the door by the husband, whom she had not seen till now. In a severe tone he said: “My wife has told me about the Bible lessons you are giving her every week. I like to know what my family is doing and so I should like you to tell me what it is all about.” The pioneer replied very tactfully to this man who showed himself to be the head of the family. He asked many questions, which the pioneer answered to his satisfaction. Then he allowed her to enter to conduct the study. At the end of the study he said to the pioneer: “Don’t come any more on Wednesday evening, but rather come on Saturday because I too want to benefit from this study.” Now he and his wife and two children are showing keen interest and are increasing daily in knowledge of the only true God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following experience shows how active Satan and his demons are, and how powerful is Jehovah’s Word against wicked spirit forces. A special pioneer writes: “While preaching from house to house I contacted a woman of about sixty years of age. She listened to my sermon with a suspicious look on her face. I explained that the reason for my call was to help persons of good will who desire to understand God’s purposes. She replied: ‘I too am in touch with God. The spirits talk to me and I can write under their dictation . . . but some of the spirits mock me. They tell me lies.’ She told me she could use a diviner’s rod because of a certain power she possessed. It amused her very much at first, but later she found that she could not sleep—the spirits suggested evil things to her. She talked to her priest about it, but he only laughed at her and shrugged his shoulders. Then she went to the Pentecostals to seek advice and was told that she was possessed of a devil!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I called back on this lady and we began to study the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> Chapter three reveals that the soul is mortal. Chapter five explains how the sons of God materialized and became demons. What a blessing this study was to this woman! It helped her to see that she was a victim of the demons. After this particular study she said to me: ‘Here, take this diviner’s rod, the cause of my misery. I won’t use it any more.’ I soon got rid of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I am continuing this study, for this person is making good progress. She said recently: ‘I thank Jehovah for having guided you to me and for your listening to me without making fun of me. Only one organization has been able to help me—and that is Jehovah’s witnesses. I hope that I too may one day serve Jehovah.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It is very difficult to help persons in the power of the demons, and without Jehovah’s help I would have abandoned this poor woman. The articles we have studied on spiritism have been very interesting and the Word of God was powerful enough to overthrow even this kind of opposition for the person of good will. How grateful we are to Jehovah, who provides all the necessary equipment in order to liberate all kinds of prisoners!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This joyful year of Kingdom service was appropriately brought to a close with two fine district assemblies, one in Lille and the other in Paris. The resolution on behalf of our brothers in Russia was joyfully and unanimously adopted with prolonged applause during its presentation. What a grand follow-up to the special campaign in April! Our prayers unite with those of our brothers all over the world for the early deliverance of our brothers behind the Iron Curtain.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>ALGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Algeria as a whole is like unassigned French territory, for, in fact, Algeria is considered officially as a department of France. This vast territory has only one small congregation of sixty-nine publishers for a population of 9,000,000. Brother Knorr arranged to have them visited by the zone servant, accompanied by the French branch servant as interpreter. The very day of their arrival a curfew was announced forbidding Europeans to leave their homes after 8 p.m. Assassinations were happening and arson was committed every day. The atmosphere was tense. A state of war was clearly evident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since its formation the congregation in Algeria has progressed from five to sixty-nine ministers. The seven special pioneers are doing good work there in the face of growing difficulties and the stress of warlike conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A young couple were being continually mocked by their relatives, who were Evangelists. The pastor came regularly to their home and tried every means to draw this couple away from the truth and into his sect. Finally he even resorted to speaking evil of Jehovah’s witnesses. When this pastor was invited to the home of the special pioneer for a discussion on the Bible he finally accepted and went, along with several of his flock. It did not take long to convince him that the teachings of his sect were in contradiction to the Bible. From time to time he said to the pioneer: “Yes, certainly Jehovah’s hand is with you.” Then he said: “Now when I address my congregation everyone drinks in all I say. But what shall I do now to tell them they have been taught error?” His next religious service was a stormy one and a heated discussion arose, because now some of the flock were refuting the trinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But alas! This pastor thought more of his position than the truth. He returned to the vomit he had once left. As for the young couple, they are more firmly convinced than ever of the truth, having now seen the hypocrisy of the pastor. The taunts of their relatives have ceased. Their mouths have been closed, whereas the young couple now offer the fruit of their lips in praise to Jehovah as they preach regularly from house to house.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom work is going ahead in Cameroun. At the beginning of this service year a new circuit was formed. Thus there are now three circuits. The circuit work is going along well, as the continual increase in number of publishers testifies. That the visits of the circuit servants are appreciated is shown by the following experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Sunday morning was devoted to announcing the public talk. But now is the rainy season and one cannot count on the weather. The discourse was, of course, to be given in the open air. At 4 p.m. it began to rain and it continued in a drenching downpour until 6 p.m. The discourse was scheduled for 6:30. Already a goodly number had gathered. At 6:35 there was a break in the clouds and the circuit servant decided to begin his talk. After half an hour the rain again began to pour in torrents. Umbrellas went up; everyone tried to protect himself. The circuit servant asked if he should stop the talk, but everyone wanted him to continue. So, protected by an umbrella, he finished his talk, and that before an attendance of 875. We looked with astonishment on these people, who were like so many hungry sheep. There is a great work to be done here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great event of the year for the brothers in Cameroun was the national assembly held in Douala. Two of the circuit servants had been to the Paris Triumphant Kingdom assembly and they were eager for their colored brothers to taste of the Kingdom joys experienced during that assembly. The assembly program was identical with the Paris program. This assembly lasted four days, November 6 to 9, and brought great joy to the brothers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are now fourteen special pioneers in this vast territory. One of them writes: “For a long time we have heard in our territory mention of the God ‘Jehovah.’ It was like the wind in the trees. It is because of such assemblies as our last circuit assembly that the people are beginning to learn of the true God Jehovah. With other brothers we traveled over a hundred miles to attend this assembly. Some went on foot and were walking for two and a half days. All were joyful on the return journey, talking of the blessings of that assembly. We thank Jehovah God, who protected us during our voyage there and back and who has given us his holy spirit so that we may retain what we have learned at that assembly.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MOROCCO</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font3">Morocco is real virgin territory. Ten months ago a married couple, special pioneers, were assigned to Casablanca. Before their arrival there were only three or four scattered isolated publishers who needed help badly in the Kingdom service. The special pioneer brother writes: “In this country, which for several years has seen only a long series of riots and where the situation is very unsettled, men of good will are now being assembled to form a Christian society that is different from all others because of the love that is made manifest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the special pioneers writes: &quot;Here we really see Satan’s world face to face, for here we come up against the four main religions: Catholic, Protestant, Jew and Islam. And all of them have a feature in common, that is, to dominate their unfortunate victims completely. How very appropriate is the title of the book ‘What Has Religion Done for Mankind?’ All these people are well and truly held in darkness because of these false shepherds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One day when preaching from house to house I met a gentleman who had been a Catholic but turned to Oriental philosophy. He accepted the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font3"> which I thought was just the book for his case. On my making the return call the following week the gentleman and his wife were convinced that they had been led astray and agreed for me to conduct a Bible study in their home. From the first study this man became a publisher, for he spoke of the truth everywhere he went. He is a teacher of music and English. He has prepared a sign ‘The Kingdom Is at Hand,’ which he exposes before his students so as to arouse their curiosity. It has proved to be very successful. While on holiday in France he got an orchestra leader interested, and he is now a publisher in Paris. He also contacted a Spanish leader of an orchestra, who is now in touch with the congregation in Barcelona. Now he and his wife are back in Casablanca awaiting the first opportunity to be baptized.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark251"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark252"></a>THE SAAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In the Saar they lack nothing in the way of spiritual food, for the Society’s publications are available to them: books, booklets and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">in German. It is true that there is considerable Catholic opposition in this small country and every obstacle possible is placed before the brothers to impede the progress of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A publisher of that country writes: “I made a call on an interested lady who lived in a very Catholic village. She had just come out of the hospital, where she had been cared for by a nun. This is what she told me: ‘As the nun came to my room she would often see me reading my Bible, while on the other side of the room a so-called religious woman raved like someone mad so as to disturb me. One day the time came for this hostile woman to leave the hospital. When she had gone, the nun turned to me and said: “Aren’t you glad that the crazy woman has gone? I know I am! I’m a Catholic, but that woman was out of her mind. You know that of all the other religions, the one I would prefer is ‘Jehovah’s witnesses,’ because they are more sincere than the others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ ‘Very astonished I replied: “I too prefer Jehovah’s witnesses. That is why I am in touch with them.” The nun replied: “My uncle is a priest in the next village. I spend my vacation at his home. One day he was visited by one of Jehovah’s witnesses who presented a very fine sermon at the doorstep. My uncle listened politely and excused himself for not inviting the person inside by saying he had no time. When the witness had gone he turned to me and said: ‘I often pray that those people might quickly increase. For it would be wonderful if everybody were like them.’ Then to my great astonishment he said: ‘If ever you have the opportunity to care for any Jehovah’s witnesses who are sick, be kind to them and care well for them, because they deserve it. Only don’t have anything to do with their doctrine, for you know we have sworn faithfulness to the church even unto death.’ ” ’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>SENEGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the past service year the brothers in Senegal have worked hard and have now established a thriving though small congregation that continues to increase month by month. The two special pioneers, together with their wives, are a source of comfort and strength to the “other sheep” who are just coming along into the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The high light in the service year was the visit of two special representatives of the Society, Brothers Henschel and Arnott, on December 5, 6 and 7, 1955. On this occasion the brothers in Senegal were able to taste some of the joys of the 1955 assemblies. Six of the main discourses were delivered by the visiting brothers to the great joy of the few local brothers there assembled. A three-day assembly for a small group of publishers! It was just wonderful! The talks were delivered in English and were translated into French by one of the special pioneers, who is now the congregation servant. It was as a result of this visit that it was decided to form a congregation. This tiny assembly was indeed a great comfort and stimulus to these brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In his most recent letter the congregation servant says: “The work is progressing slowly but surely. This month we reported eleven publishers. We are hoping to get three more publishers in the field in May—thus, counting the pioneers, we shall have a total of seventeen publishers.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>TUNISIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that Tunisia has gained its independence does not lessen the fear that many Europeans living there have for the future. This is manifest by the growing number of persons who are emigrating to Europe. It is even so among the publishers in Tunis, in fact, for some months it has been like an exodus. From August, 1955, up until August, 1956, at least twenty-six publishers left Tunis; twenty-three for France and three for Algeria. These brothers were obliged to make this change because of their secular work. Next month three more publishers will be leaving Tunis; two for France and one for Algeria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spite of the unsettled conditions that prevail there in Tunisia, not to mention the suffocating heat (95 degrees Fahrenheit to 107 in the shade at midday), the publishers are pressing on with the preaching of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A special pioneer reports: &quot;I had just worked the town of Sfax. When making the back-calls I placed the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’</span><span class="font3"> with Monsieur---</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for one of his friends. However, try as I would I could not obtain the name nor the address of this friend. I wondered how I could possibly find him in a town of 40,000 inhabitants. I left the matter with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Some weeks later I made a back-call on a lady. While I was talking to her outside her house a young man approached and I stepped aside to let him pass, thinking he was her husband. But he stopped at the doorway and so I continued to talk to him. He listened to my back-call sermon with obvious pleasure. At the close of my sermon he said: ‘I know all that; my work mate often talks to me of such things. And I know it is the truth.’ Do you guess who he was? He was not the lady’s husband. But he lived in the same block and I had him marked as ‘absent.’ He was the friend of Monsieur---. How glad I was to meet him! I presented</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the offer of the month, a subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">which he gladly accepted, and I arranged for a home Bible study. He made rapid progress. Two months later he turned in his first report of field service—thirty hours! Now this ‘other sheep’ is isolated, because later I was assigned to Tunis. But he is persevering in the truth all the same.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark255"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>WESTERN GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A year of intense activity in Western Germany shows up in the report of that country. The work was better organized during the year. The brothers throughout Germany saw the need of getting out into isolated territories, sections of Western Germany that had not been worked before. The brothers really took hold of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> campaigns, and every division of the field, the congregation publishers, the pioneers and the special pioneers, made its quota for the year. Western Germany had an increase of seven percent in publishers and reached a new peak of 50,530 in April, 1956. The Society is making plans for greater expansion. A new press is on order to take care of the work there. New buildings are planned and these are all things that we hope to accomplish during the 1957 service year. We do not want to slow down in serving spiritual food to the people of Western Germany. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences that will make our hearts glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work in unassigned territories was an additional high light in the ministry work. By means of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> and through letters the congregations were made aware of the wonderful opportunity they had to help persons of good will living in unassigned territories to become acquainted with Jehovah’s purpose by presenting the three-bound-book offer. They started to work with an enthusiasm without equal, and this is responsible for the fact that at least 80 percent of our unassigned territory was worked. There are, therefore, only few persons in Western Germany who were not sought out this year by a minister presenting the good news of the Kingdom. Consequently, the results were good. Whereas 35,824 books were placed during the months of July and August of 1955, the enthusiastic Kingdom publishers during the same two months in 1956 distributed 95,392; this is an increase of 166 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A congregation servant reports about working in one village and remarks that everything that they experienced there was reminiscent of the dark Middle Ages: “The entire village was in tumult. The youngsters of the village, with the intention of causing the people to turn us away at their doors, went before us from house to house reporting that we were coming. It was not possible to leave even a single book in this village.” A week later they worked another village in the same territory. The publishers gathered together in front of the railroad station to discuss the daily text before they went in the service. In conclusion the congregation servant said several words of encouragement in respect to the service and suggested that one of the publishers give an introductory witness. The publisher replied that they would be pleased if he would do it this time; so the congregation servant began. He had hardly gotten started before a man came across the street, joined the group of publishers and began to listen. The congregation servant took advantage of this opportunity and spoke directly to this man, just as Jehovah’s witnesses do at people’s doors. When he had finished, the stranger pulled out his wallet and said: “I would like to have those books.” That was a good start for the publishers in their field service activity for the day, and as they got a little better acquainted with this man, they found out that he lived in the village where a week before they had not been able to leave even one book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Good progress in magazine distribution was also achieved. It was possible to place 5,583,403 copies, 60 percent more than last year. The number of special pioneers also climbed from 58 to 103. They are doing good work and are laying the foundation for new congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides these blessings, still another great joy was ours during the year. We were able to purchase and become legal owners of our Bethel home and factory, which originally was just a shell of a building resembling a ruins and which was transformed by us into what it is today. Truly Jehovah is a Father who provides. He is able to return to us everything that his enemies may take away. We have experienced that here in this land. We have not only gotten back a beautiful Bethel home but in addition thereto many brothers and sisters—yes, more than ever before.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah encourages his servants to prove him so as to gain his blessing. This is true of the New World society in the Gold Coast. They are taking Jehovah at his word and they have received blessings beyond measure. They have gone ahead diligently preaching the good news and “from day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> There are some real problems that have to be met here because of the illiteracy of the people, and Jehovah’s witnesses try to overcome them. While many cannot read, they can understand and they can talk the truth to others. Excellent increases have been made in the gathering together of the other sheep; so there is good evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon those who are preaching now. The training program has had </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">wonderful effect on the brothers in the Gold Coast and other territory under the direction of the branch servant at Accra. The work continues not only in the Gold Coast, but in Gambia, Ivory Coast and Togoland. Some interesting experiences are set out here from each of these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the methods employed by the brothers in the northern territories to expand the magazine distribution in a land where there is much illiteracy is very interesting. A witness will place an English copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> with a person who cannot read by pointing out one of the illustrations in the main study article. At the close of the discussion the witness will say: “I will be back next week to explain this picture to you.” At the service meeting in the congregation a qualified brother will explain how the picture fits into the material in the article and the witness then will return to the good-will person and they will have a study on the illustration. The next study would be on the following illustration and so on until the magazine is completely covered. In this way it is possible for a study of God’s Word to be conducted, even though neither person can yet read the printed page. Many good-will persons appreciate this help and readily take copies of the magazines regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service year has been one of steady growth for the brothers in the Gold Coast. First the government raised the quota of missionaries for the Watch Tower Society and as a result a missionary home has been established in the interior at Kumasi. The brothers at the congregation in Kumasi are very grateful for the assistance of the missionaries and are always happy to have the chance to work in the field with them. The Triumphant Kingdom assembly held in Accra during November was an occasion for rejoicing in theocratic expansion and has given the brothers a better appreciation of the New World society. Notable was a telegram of good wishes for a successful assembly sent to Brother Henschel by the prime minister for the Gold Coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A brother writes: “It was the usual street magazine day and I was standing at my place when I saw a priest coming. I approached him and offered him </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> but he was not in position to take it, so I tactfully gave him a short sermon and he left. One night while calling on my good-will persons I met this same priest. I gave him a short sermon and presented to him the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> on ‘God or Politics,’ which he gladly accepted. The following Sunday my service center had arranged a public talk, so I invited him to the talk. He took me to his house and from there we proceeded to the study center. After the talk I arranged to call on him for Bible discussions, to which he readily agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“After just two studies in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’</span><span class="font3"> he started to attend the congregation book studies and soon also the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">studies and the service meetings. It was not long before he began going out with me placing magazines before the book study and in the evening back-call work. He is very happy to see the truth. He said he had been blind for twenty-five years and now Jehovah has opened his eyes to see the light. He had been a priest for twenty-five years and he is now happy with the New World society.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark258"></a>FRENCH TOGOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The circuit servant for Togoland related an experience that bears out how people of good will respond to the truth. He says: “At one village called Atampke, about eighteen miles from Glei, two persons have come in contact with the truth in a wonderful way and are now standing for the truth. A good-will person moved to this village and in conversation told a woman that there is a great destruction coming upon all idol worshipers. This woman asked the good-will person what one can do to avoid that destruction, and she was directed to go to a brother at Glei who would explain conditions to her. This woman went to Glei to see the brother, who gave her a thorough witness about the truth. Now she and her son have taken their stand firmly for the truth and the two of them go out from house to house with the brothers telling others of this way of safety. Though they are being strongly opposed by their family in the village, yet they are determined to continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work has gone on unmolested during the past year, so the brothers are free to go about their preaching work in peace. Generally the native police are not willing to restrict the activity of the brothers and they pay little attention to them as they preach from house to house. As the numbers continue to grow there is an increasing need for maturity among all associated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>GAMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s true servants are aware of the scripture that says: &quot;Love is long-suffering and obliging.” Continued long-suffering and patience are required of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, and this is especially true of the brothers in Gambia. False religion and materialism have a powerful hold on the lives of the people, so they do not readily respond to the “good news” now being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers in Gambia did not have an increase in numbers during the year, but they have much to be thankful for, because their increased maturity in the field is obvious from their reports. They remained regular in their preaching activity and many books, booklets and magazines were placed with interested persons during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>IVORY COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Almost all the work in the Ivory Coast is done in the capital city of Abidjan and here is located the only congregation in the country. Many are those who know of the truth without taking their stand for it, because of their love for pleasures. Leading an unclean life is not a strange thing to the people. However, the clean lives of Jehovah’s witnesses cannot go unnoticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the missionaries in the Ivory Coast reported the following experience: “I contacted a Syrian family that showed fair interest in the truth, but because of certain obligations the father remained lukewarm. I placed the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font3"> with them and the father also subscribed for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font3">magazines. I made a return visit and started a home Bible study. One day the wife remarked that she had learned more about the Bible in a few studies than during all her lifetime with the Catholic Church and she was glad to say that her husband now reads the magazines and the Bible each night before going to bed. Another day I noticed that a cross that had been placed on a decorated table had been taken away and had been replaced by a flowerpot. After the study she called my attention to what she had learned about clean and true worship and said: ‘I have sent the cross back to the Catholic father because we like to be Jehovah’s witnesses.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is a very enthusiastic spirit in Greece because of the Triumphant Kingdom assemblies last summer. The good news from these assemblies was channeled to all the local congregations. Despite the great difficulties that the Greek brothers face, they still endeavor to prove they are qualified to be ministers. They are part of the great world-wide theocratic organization. And while it is absolutely forbidden for them to proselytize anyone, they can still go around and talk. The Greek Orthodox Church is very much afraid of Jehovah’s witnesses and at every turn it tries to stop them. Jehovah, however, continues to pour out upon all of his people a rich blessing, greater than they can contain. The branch servant in Athens reports on Greece and gives us some very interesting experiences. He also has jurisdiction of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Turkey, and in that land the work is moving ahead very steadily, with unusual success during the year. That country saw a thirty-nine-percent increase. All of us will enjoy reading excerpts from the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year we had the privilege of being faced with an extremely violent storm of legal charges laid by clergymen who had received the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christendom or Christianity—Which One Is “the Light of the World”!</span><span class="font3"> A multitude of such charges were laid on brothers who had sent booklets to clergymen. The charges were identical in all instances, “attempt to proselytize.” Although in almost all the cases the brothers were discharged, in certain areas of the country the law courts sentenced the brothers to prison terms ranging from one to nine months, and to heavy fines. The reason given for such amazing sentences was that the clerics who had received the booklets were illiterate, of low spiritual level, and therefore likely to be proselytized! Unprecedented is, however, the extent of testimony given on account of this law-court campaign. The brothers were happy for their privilege to meet this assault from the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One brother from a southern Greek island, who had sustained hard pressure from the clergymen and was burdened with heavy judicial charges and considerable fines, did not want to accept financial assistance offered him by others. He wanted to bear the whole charge himself. Here is what he wrote in reply to the offer made to him: “. . . You write that you would like to help me in my judicial affairs, but I let you know that Jehovah our God rises very early and helps His people, and therefore I too have been favored with His care in carrying out this judicial fight. I assure you that this is the first time so much money was to be found in my hands.” When such a spirit governs Jehovah’s people, how could they fail to triumph over wicked forces?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In an unassigned territory the brothers rented a room and then pushed out to the whole area. One day they took a rowboat to reach an isolated shore lying opposite. On their arrival there, a lady who saw the boat approaching ran toward the brothers and asked them who they were and what they had come for. The brothers answered that they were Jehovah’s witnesses and had come to tell the people about the kingdom of God. The lady directly exclaimed: “Oh! doubtless Jehovah has sent you! I heard of the truth when at Piraeus a long time ago, and now at this isolated place I was always thinking of how to communicate with the witnesses. And just now Jehovah sent you here.” Great was the brothers’ joy at finding this sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When small places are visited, it is immediately reported that some stranger came and distributed literature, telling about God and his kingdom. Thus many opportunities are given and a door of utterance is opened by this apostolic way of preaching. A villager heard that a brother had spoken good things in the village square to a group of the inhabitants the day before. When he met the brother the next day he told him: “Do you see that house with the red-tiled roof? It’s my home. I ask you to come tomorrow, so that we too may hear of these good things.” The brother went there the next day and gave a good witness and placed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”,</span><span class="font3"> two booklets and two copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> There are truly many sheep in unassigned territories, and we greatly rejoice in finding and feeding them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A circuit servant on his arrival at a congregation located in a very harsh, unhospitable place was attacked by local mobsters who even attempted to destroy the motorcar by which the brother traveled. They were unsuccessful, owing to intervention of a good-will villager. They subsequently stoned the house where the brothers were holding a meeting. But one year later, when the circuit servant visited the village again and the brothers recollected the stoning experience, a young brother rose and told the circuit servant: “Brother, I too was among the stoners.” Now he is an active and zealous minister of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now that we have reached the doorstep of a new service year we are determined to continue with unbending steadiness in the promotion of true worship, keeping pace with Jehovah’s organization and having uppermost in mind the divine interests in our life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Please accept, dear Brother Knorr, the greetings and love of the whole Bethel family.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark262"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Brothers who were Moslems are doing practically all the preaching among the Moslems. They are conducting home Bible studies and these are making good progress. Occasionally it happens that, when preaching to members of a “Christian” church, the Turkish brother finds himself in an awkward situation. One Turkish brother, after a lengthy discussion with a “Christian,” found that this “Christian” didn’t accept the Bible’s testimony. The argument was whether the unity of Jehovah’s witnesses was a sign of God’s miraculous power today in fulfillment of Bible prophecy or not. After the “Christian” answered negatively, the brother summed up by asking: “Would you consider it a normal thing for a man to bite a dog?” The listener answered: “No!” “Well, that is exactly what is happening here. I, the Moslem, am trying to convince a Christian to believe in Christ.” That is precisely the situation in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the Moslems’ conversion to Christianity has so delighted us, think of our joy at seeing nine Jewish people baptized this year! They are busy teaching their Jewish friends the meaning of God’s Word in support of Christ’s first and second appearances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tact and patience on the part of the publishers helps them overcome difficult questions. A young brother who has a small clothing shop waited several weeks for a credit customer to return and settle his bill. Since the person had left his address as proof of trust with the brother the brother decided to make a friendly visit. He took some booklets with him and talked about the Kingdom to the family he found at home. He not only collected his bill, but also started a study with the entire family. Now, eight months later, these five people are enjoying the things they are learning from the brother who was inoffensive in his first visit to them. Another sister, going alone for the first time in the service, met a Jewish family that listened to her message with tears in their eyes. A return call during one of their religious holidays found them at home. After a two-hour discussion the man said: &quot;Everyone of our people is at the synagogue today, except us. We have learned more about God and have been closer to Him here than they have.” They have now asked the sister to call on their friends and relatives, to whom they have been preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One outstanding event of this service year was the Memorial celebration. This time of year means assembling together with all the brothers in one place. It is anticipated months in advance and everyone snares in making it a big success. We have used a rented hall that belongs to the Armenian Gregorian Church. The refusal this year of the church authorities to rent us the hall did not come as a surprise to us, as the growth of Jehovah’s witnesses is becoming an ever-increasing cause of embarrassment to these clerics. The question was, Would we have our gathering as in previous years in one place? Yes! By Jehovah’s wonderful provision it was possible to use the Dutch Chapel. Two hundred ninety-two persons packed out the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This report would not be complete without mention of the humble Armenian people who have been coming into the truth very rapidly. The largest number of persons of good will associating with the New World society are coming from them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In many parts of the world better leadership is needed and more full-time servants are required to take the overseers’ positions. The branch office is doing all it can to give proper instructions to the servants of the different congregations. The brothers cannot depend just on the zeal of a branch servant or a circuit servant, but they must depend on the zeal of the congregation servants, who likewise are overseers, to give the proper leadership. The congregations will grow on to maturity and everyone will improve if these brothers take the proper lead. On the island of Guadeloupe there has been a little standing still this year; some cleansing had to take place. What are needed are more full-time workers, if they are available. How true it is that in all parts of the world we could use many, many more fulltime representatives of Jehovah, to reach out to the ends of the islands, the countries and provinces to preach the good news. The branch servant in Guadeloupe gives us a very interesting report of things that have occurred. He also looks after the island of Martinique, and some experiences are set out concerning that place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A couple assigned to Guadeloupe was traveling on a liner from France. At lunch time as they witnessed to their table neighbors, the waiter was listening intently while taking care of his duties; when the conversation was over he requested: “Please, continue, I do like these things.” Arrangements were made to see him after his working time. Then he asked many questions and explained how he has been disgusted with Catholic priests because of the excesses of some. When the voyage finished for our couple, literature was left with the waiter. Three months later the boat called back to Guadeloupe. The waiter was still on board and his first words were: “Do you have some more publications? I have already read the others twice.” He could not keep for himself alone what he had learned. His fellow workers had to get a knowledge too! Even to a priest he mentioned his meeting with Jehovah’s witnesses and the wonderful way one can learn in the Bible with them. Said the priest: “These Jehovah’s witnesses have bewitched you, unless you are already one of them.” He answered back: “I am not yet one of them, but I will be one of them, I and my wife, my children, my family, and I will help some others to come too. 111686 people have the truth and you should copy their example!” The priest did not take the counsel, but the waiter is keeping his word. His wife has joined in studying the Bible and both show that wonderful spirit that only other sheep can have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the help of the Society’s boat Light, two neighboring islands, Marie-Galante and La Desirade, received our visit. The Catholic Hierarchy tries to keep things under her control in these remote places. Nevertheless, the people, being naturally hospitable, received us well. In Marie-Galante the film “The New World Society in Action” was shown several times. Said one in the audience: “Well, if you had given me ten thousand francs you could not have made my heart as glad as it is tonight!” Nearly 2,000 pieces of literature were left in the hands of the people, some of them showing a real interest. In the churches priests thundered against those taking literature, but that was all. On our departure a man said: “Don’t forget us; we have been enriched by your visit and we shall long to see you again.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark264"></a>MARTINIQUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">One year ago the film “The New World Society in Action” was shown in the yard around the house of a brother. The screen was hanging on a papaw tree and about fifty persons enjoyed the pictures. Among them was a new neighbor and the brother explained more of the truth to her in the following days. Her interest kept growing, and she began to attend the congregation Bible study in the house of the brother. She realized then what Jehovah’s will is and took the steps in order to get rid of the married man she was living with in concubinage; he tried to come back several times but to no avail. The truth had become her shield! Four of her six children were living outside her house because of her position. She got them back and helped them to start learning the truth. After a few months she and the four children began going into field service—that was on Christmas, set aside as a Magazine Day. She has been baptized since at the circuit assembly with two of her children, a girl of eighteen and a boy of fifteen. Well, baptism is only one more step on the way of serving Jehovah with a devoted heart. Having little children still to care for, she encouraged her daughter to take up full-time service as a career. That young sister did so; giving up her job as a cashier she made an application for vacation pioneering. When six months have elapsed after her baptism she will ask to be a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jehovah’s witnesses are the most pernicious sect in our days!” A man was told these words by Evangelists and warned against talking with them. But he did. What he learned amazed him. Evangelists had said that we do not believe at all in Christ, but the sister calling at his home pointed out that the opposite was true. Then she took up the matter of who is the true God and how unchristian and unbiblical is the teaching of trinity. The man was not long in being convinced. He said: “I cannot believe any more in the trinity, as I have just seen that the Bible does not teach it.” A Bible study has been established for more knowledge about true religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the clergy in Guatemala constantly preach against Jehovah’s witnesses as their big target. They have singled out for attack the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font4"> calling it “the book of perdition.” They tell those in their congregations that anyone that reads it is in danger of wandering away from the church and anyone that studies it all has his foot in the lake of fire and brimstone. Despite this opposition on the part of the clergy Jehovah’s witnesses continue to visit the people and the honest-hearted ones are turning to Jehovah’s organization. The publishers in Guatemala have made more back-calls and conducted more home Bible studies and have given more public talks this year than last year. We find a very fine increase has been made in the distribution of magazines. The brothers are having good experiences, and appreciate greatly the showers of blessings that Jehovah is pouring upon them. The branch servant gives us some interesting high lights about this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The beneficial results of magazine distribution are shown by a letter received by the Guatemalan branch office written by a former Protestant minister. He writes: “In 1953 I had the opportunity of first meeting Jehovah’s witnesses through the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine. I had never heard of Jehovah’s witnesses before, but that very day I wrote to the Society. I had no understanding at all of these glorious truths. A pioneer and the circuit servant visited me and I let them give talks in my church. In October, 1954, a visiting supervisor of the Central Evangelical Church reported to the head offices that I was working with Jehovah’s witnesses. They immediately expelled me and became my worst enemies. In April, 1956, I began to go from door to door offering the good news of the Kingdom. To me this is really a joyful work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not all of Christendom’s ministers react like this, however. In a port town one moaned: “Why do you</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses come here and go from door to door, scattering literature everywhere? Then I </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font3"> to go from door to door behind you collecting it again. I have a pile of your books and every so often have to burn them publicly.” No joyful door-to-door service for this man. The pioneer replied: “Your book-burning reminds me of Franco in Spain. He had 110,000 Bibles destroyed just to keep the people from learning the truth. You are destroying books announcing God’s kingdom for the very same reason.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Faithful attendance and keen appreciation for congregational meetings are mirrored by an experience from a small congregation. While in the Kingdom ministry one Sunday morning a young publisher offered a book to a man, who replied: “I already have that book. I have had it for some time and have read it through and through, but I was never able to find just where you had your meetings.” The minister gladly gave him the address of the local Kingdom Hall and that very evening the man was present for the study. Soon his wife also began attending the meetings and at the district assembly this year they were baptized. They attend regularly although they live seven miles from the Kingdom Hall and frequently must walk both to and from meetings. The minister who discovered this man and his wife lives about five miles from the Kingdom Hall and is also faithful in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently it became necessary to reassign a special pioneer, but where should he be assigned? Several days passed. Unexpectedly a letter was received by the branch signed by about twenty-five people asking for help. They were studying among themselves but wanted someone to stay with them and give them more instruction. They had even arranged a room for anyone that could come. This seemed to answer the question of where to reassign the special pioneer. He went. Some were so far advanced in their own study that six new publishers reported the very first month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work is expanding outside the capital city now and more congregations are springing up in the rural regions, thereby aiding the Kingdom message to extend to every nook and cranny.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark266"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The small country of Haiti in the Caribbean Sea had a very excellent increase this past year. The number of towns having resident publishers now has doubled in number. Many new territories have been opened up. In the year 1955 there was a decrease in publishers of two percent, but in 1956 they overcame all of this and then some, increasing 32 percent and reaching a new peak of 299 publishers for the year. This healthy increase has made the local publishers very glad, and they are determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to bring those newly coming into the truth to maturity. They had am increase too in the distribution of individual magazines. Back-calls and Bible studies also increased. All of this had a very telling effect on the growth of the work in Haiti. The missionaries did very good work during the past year, along with some new special pioneers, and it is hoped that more special pioneers can be added to the field. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences of the happenings there during 1956.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One Pentecostal preacher argued and studied with one of the special pioneers for a month, until the brother gave him up. Finally, when he was in the service one day, the preacher called him over and agreed with him that there was no trinity. Recently appointed inspector of churches in a rural area by the Haitian headquarters of the Pentecostal church, after four studies he turned down the job and never returned to church. Visiting Port-au-Prince, he sought lodgings at the pastor’s home, but he gave no place to out-of-towners. After passing the night on a church bench, he found the witnesses Sunday morning and went along with them in the service. That evening he met them at the Kingdom Hall and was hospitably taken in by brothers. When the church deacons at Hinche came to see him he showed them that church leaders were false, misleading, practicing tradition and discrediting the Bible, according to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font3"> “You will lose your soul; you are a witness of Jah,” said the deacons. He responded: “That is my concern. If you wish, I will study the Bible with you.” The pioneer’s report concluded: “He is now preaching, and I study with his wife and brother. What joy! Nothing in this old world could tear me away from the ranks of full-time fighters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A married couple enjoyed wonderful experiences while on visits to Jacmel, a town of gorgeous, sandy beaches. They expressed their willingness to accept another assignment when two new couples were assigned to Haiti, so down they went to Jacmel in April. They now write: “We placed books with a man several years back during a two-week visit. When we got here to set up the missionary home we met him one day and told him we were here to stay this time. Asked if he would like to study the Bible with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup>,</span><span class="font3"> he asked, ‘Right now?’ and we replied, ‘Yes.’ In fifteen minutes the study started at his home and he has not missed a session since. For a public talk with thirteen attending, he brought half the number present. He went to Port-au-Prince for Brother Franz’ talk and was much enthused by the new film. He uses a brief sermon in the service now. We have twenty studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Franz drew our largest Port-au-Prince attendance this year at a special meeting arranged for the public. A show was canceled, and the government gave us the open-air Theatre de Verdure free for the event. By permission from you, Brother Knorr, we had a triple treat. First, the public talk by Brother Franz, then the petition to Bulganin, which was adopted by the 858 present, and finally the showing of the Society’s new film, for which the attendance grew to 1,019. Rain forced a late start, but the whole program went off fine. We twenty missionaries, together for the first time, felt so happy to have Brother Franz lead us in prayer in the home and then speak to our publishers and Interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark267"></a><span class="font4">In the beautiful islands of the Pacific called Hawaii Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the good news. While there has not been a great increase in the number of publishers this year, still those that have come into the truth have been brought on to maturity and there have been fine increases in the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines. The congregation publishers averaged 129 magazines placed in a year, or approximately eleven each month. The pioneers and special pioneers have more than met their quotas. They feel that a good increase is inevitable during this service year of 1957 because of the firm foundation upon which they have built during the past twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every once in a while uncleanness develops within the congregations and this causes a disturbance. The unclean ones are removed, but it takes time to stabilize those that remain, because many people coming into the truth are upset by misconduct of those claiming to be in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very zealous sister left to go to Canton Island, there to live with her husband, and now a new field has been opened up and this congregation publisher feels just like a missionary in a new land. The branch servant in Hawaii gives good news of what has happened in the islands of Hawaii and also reports on Canton Island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The 1956 service year was certainly most outstanding for Jehovah’s witnesses in Hawaii. The high light of the year was your visit, Brother Knorr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The many things that you called to our attention were greatly appreciated. The new arrangements that you approved for holding circuit assemblies on each of the major islands every six months have already shown results, as we have seen the largest circuit-assembly attendance in the history of the New World society in Hawaii. The brothers are also grateful to you and the Society for the Hawaiian edition of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font3"> These along with many other things have laid the groundwork for increase during the new service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That many obstacles to pioneering can be overcome if one sincerely desires to serve Jehovah full time is shown by one of our sisters, who is the mother of five children, the oldest being twelve. This sister has enjoyed the pioneer service now for nearly a year. How does she manage to meet the pioneer requirements? First, she has intense love for Jehovah and she combines good planning and organization with this. She leaves home in the morning at 7:30, taking the children to school. Leaving the children at school she immediately proceeds to her territory, where she works until time to pick up the children after school when she returns home. In this way she does not neglect her family or Jehovah. Results are good, as she reports that she needs help in caring for the interest she has contacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was necessary to dissolve one congregation during the year, the one we had organized within the walls of the prison. This was owing to the fact that two of the three dedicated brothers that made up this congregation were transferred to two different honor camps on outside islands. As a result, the preaching of good news has now spread into these honor camps in the past year. Consequently each of the three brothers has aided another fellow inmate to dedication. It has also been our privilege to show the movie “The New World Society in Action” to the inmates at these honor camps. This, of course, was enjoyed by our brothers, and has given them greater zeal and enthusiasm for Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unusual experiences never cease for Jehovah’s witnesses. One day while I was working in the branch office the telephone rang. Upon answering I heard an angry woman, thoroughly disgusted with Jehovah’s witnesses because of their attack on Catholicism. I tried to explain that we were not attacking Catholicism, but were preaching the truth concerning the purposes of Jehovah, and as a result the false teachings were being exposed. All of this was seemingly to no avail. To my surprise and happiness several months later the phone rang again. When I answered it the voice on the other end stated, “I have called to apologize,” and then went on to explain that she had called a few months ago and accused us of attacking her religion, but now after considering the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses she was convinced that we were telling the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Getting her name and address for a study was an easy matter. She is now studying with one of our pioneers and attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark268"></a>CANTON ISLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The water of truth began to fall on the people living on this small circle of parched coral rock in mid-Pacific just six months ago, when a sister took up residence there owing to her husband’s employment. She is very happy to have a missionary assignment even though she is only a congregation publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">She writes concerning her trip from Hawaii to Canton Island and some of her experiences. “I had a short ten hours in the air to think about my new assignment on this island. I left all the literature that I was able to bring with me in a very short time, placing a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font3"> book with a minister and schoolteacher from the Gilbert Islands. By the time I was able to make a back-call on this minister he had al-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ready given a sermon from the book I had placed with him. He was going to the Gilbert Islands for a short visit and requested some of the magazines to take along with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Now this good-will minister and schoolteacher has returned to Canton and I have started a Bible study with him. He has requested that I come to the school and give Bible instruction to the children once a week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This, of course, the sister is doing and the average attendance at the one study is nineteen persons. Thus the Kingdom seed is being sown on this small remote island, and should it be necessary for this publisher to leave, we are sure that the seed planted will bear fruit to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">With grateful hearts the witnesses of Jehovah in Honduras continue preaching the good news of the Kingdom. While the year has been full of activity, still there has been further cleaning within the organization. As the brothers will recall, some years ago there was a bad name brought upon the organization because of the conduct of the former branch servant, and the brothers are still combating this. A number who were at one time associated with the truth have gone back to the filth of the old world, and their love has cooled off. They have looked to people whom they thought would set the right example for them and found failure, and so they have been led astray. A great responsibility falls upon those who are overseers to make straight paths for their feet so that they will not stumble others, because they may not only lose their own life, but they may keep others from gaining life. So this year finds another definite decrease in the number of publishers in Honduras. This is owing to uncleanness and is attributed to an improper example. That is why it is so important for overseers to take a definite stand for the Kingdom and work with the brothers, not only in words, but in deeds. Hypocrites have no place in God’s kingdom. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences and a few of these are quoted herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not all is news of decreases, but many wonderful and heart-warming experiences have been the lot of the brothers and missionaries during the year. The movie “The New World Society in Action,” has been a very good witness in itself, as it continues to be shown in the smaller towns in this country. The circuit servant reports large groups of from 300 to 400 turning out to see the picture in many small towns, many asking questions and taking literature. All have marveled at the unity and the happiness of the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One town, only accessible by airplane, was worked for the first time by the circuit servant. His first night there people came to his hotel room to ask if he was the man with the Bible books and to take literature. Much literature was placed and good-will letters are being sent there to keep the interest going until he returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To show the need of more workers and especially special pioneers I should like to mention one of several letters received here in the office. In part it says: “It has been several years that we have been reading your literature and we know it is the truth. We have read with much interest the books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Equipped for Every Good Work<sup>1</sup>, Salvation, ‘The Truth Shall Make You Free’</span><span class="font3"> and we have subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">for two years. I should like to know if we can study, even by mail, though we are not members of your organization, as we want to learn more about the kingdom of God. We sincerely hope your work will reach this little town and help us.” Here was a Macedonian call, which was answered by a visit from the circuit servant. The result? An isolated publisher now reporting time, and by the next visit prospects of a small group made up of the family. The new publisher was thrilled to take part in the witness work with the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One missionary reports a nice experience had while delivering a magazine to a Chinese back-call. “A young girl listened closely, and then with what little Spanish she knew, having recently come from Hong Kong, and with her cousin, my back-call, as interpreter, explained that she too believed the Bible. My surprise increased when she mentioned that she had two books that explained the Bible, which turned out to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> in Chinese. A study was started, as she read in the Chinese copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and I in the Spanish. The scriptures also were read in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">She has moved to another town in Honduras and another missionary is caring for her there.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Good results have come of working the outlying banana camps along the north coast. We call it working The Line, because the only means of transportation is train. Many pieces of literature have been placed and the people have expressed how much they appreciate these visits. Many have asked: “When will you come again and study more with us?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hong Kong is a big, busy market with the people speaking a half-dozen different dialects. It is another place in this world where Jehovah’s witnesses preach about the triumphant kingdom. While the group preaching the good news there is small, they are very energetic and even the clergy who oppose Jehovah’s witnesses testify that Jehovah’s witnesses have done more work than ever before. They do get in among the people and bring comfort and encouragement to them and, above all, they give them a knowledge of God’s purposes. The Society has a number of local pioneers and special pioneers working there and doing fine work. The branch servant gives us some fine experiences about what is going on in this busy place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A bright spot in our report throughout the year has been the work done by the local Chinese pioneer publishers. By the end of the year there were twelve on the list, over ten percent of the congregation publishers; and they are not of the kind that shrink back, for although all are young, some are going into their fourth year of full-time service. This good example is encouraging others to go straight from school into the glorious full-time service, thus turning the well-known ability of the Chinese mind to become fully absorbed in a subject to occupy its powers in the very highest cause.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark270"></a><span class="font3">Hong Kong’s alleyways are famous. Merchants all selling the same sort of goods love to crowd together. They work on the principle that if they block up the whole roadway with colorful displays of goods so that you can only squeeze past, it is a certainty you will buy. How do you get on witnessing in such a noisy jam-packed lane where everyone knows your business the moment you step in? Recently when working in just such a place, the circuit servant placed magazines and booklets at many of the shops; then weaving about amid the displays he was greeted by persons who repeated the address and time of the Tuesday evening service-center meeting that had been included in the testimony. This greeting was part of a show of politeness, which usually carries no real intention. However, promptly on the following Tuesday one young man did come to the center. He had received the witness at a bird shop where the voice had to compete with the chirping of innumerable birds. He came to the next circuit assembly and did some preaching himself and has now joined the ministry school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hong Kong newspapers have given us good publicity. At circuit assembly time they published pictures and gave good write-ups of our various activities. It has been usual to get a full column, too, on the public talk, giving a faithful summary of the material. When, at our final assembly in August, the petition to Premier Bulganin was read and adopted, it made big news that found its way to the front page of the Sunday papers and caused much inquiry. Alert following of the Society’s lead in establishing good public relations has paid off well here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fresh in our minds is the visit in April of Brothers Knorr, Adams and Barry. By far the most vivid and lasting impression was the vigorous driving into our minds by the president of the urgency and necessity of mastering the local Cantonese dialect as the very best medium for our witness here. With that incentive and start the missionaries have kept up the pace and are making headway as never before. Two wonderful helps in speeding language study are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> now available in Chinese, so that both congregation and home Bible studies are swinging more and more to Chinese, thereby tapping a huge section of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pleasing outcome of the president’s visit was our obtaining a bright new missionary home and Kingdom Hall on the slope above the main center of town on Hong Kong Island. With a view as fine as one could wish to see, this home is the nerve center of theocratic activity in Hong Kong proper and here there is much scope for expansion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark271"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the course of the past year the brothers in Hungary have had to bear up under many trials and difficulties. However, word comes through that they have great joy in the service they are able to perform. They remember, too, that Satan is a crafty foe and that he will use every scheme to turn the brothers away from the service of the true God. Some men who have been disfellow-shiped have endeavored to work against the organization. They have gone to the authorities that banned the meetings in Budapest. These disfellow-shiped persons were told they would be allowed to meet again if the National Church gave them permission and if they entered the National Church. These opposers have done this and have now announced to all the brothers that they may meet again because they have arranged for meetings with the government. Of course, they had to make compromises. But the brothers are wise to the machinations of these disfellowshiped ones, and they will not have anything to do with these persons, nor with their newly formed church, which they now claim is the official representative of Jehovah’s witnesses in Hungary. While those who remain faithful to Jehovah’s New World society are secure in Jehovah, their refuge, a warning has been sent to them and we know that Jehovah knows those who belong to him and we feel certain they will be guided and protected. A report from Hungary gives the following, which will be of interest to all of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The nearer we get to the battle of Armageddon the greater are the trials we have to bear. Satan the Devil not only uses the authorities to fight us from the exterior but he has also managed to get elements posing as our brothers to sneak into Jehovah’s organization in order to cause confusion and break it up. The apostle Paul speaks of such happenings when he says: “For there must also be sects among you, that the persons approved may also become manifest among you.” (1 Cor. 11:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> There is now such a situation in our country. Persons who are willing to compromise want to corrupt our pure and undefiled worship. They want to make us give up our neutral stand for the purpose of using us for their selfish interests. We would blaspheme the name of God if we agreed to their request and thus would be unfaithful to our dedication vows. It would mean to takes sides with foreign gods and thus commit idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When we consider the history of God’s typical people we recognize that the Israelites always had a high price to pay when they turned away from Jehovah’s pure Word and brought reproach upon his holy name. These happenings must be a continual warning to us not to allow ourselves to get into a similar situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Burials are the only opportunity for us to meet publicly. In the course of the year an eighty-six-year-old sister who had formerly belonged to the Reformed Church died in a little village where there was only one other family in the truth. Before she died the pastor of the village warned her to “think it well over,” because if she died without her pastor, no church bells would be rung and he would not allow her to be buried in the church cemetery. This did not impress the sister in the least, and she died a few days later. Brothers then came from neighboring villages and without asking the pastor dug a grave in the cemetery. After the sister died, the pastor, filled with hatred against Jehovah’s witnesses, stated that she had left the faith and would be buried like an animal. He encouraged the people to attend the funeral, hoping that it would be a failure. Hearing that there would be “an extraordinary burial” very many came. Yes, there they heard many new things, which they were talking about for days afterward. After hearing the talk, a sixty-six-year-old man who suffered from cancer told the brothers that he was not one of Jehovah’s witnesses but that since he would soon die he would be pleased if they would bury him. They agreed. When he died, his relatives wanted the pastor to bury, him, but his wife, having begun to study the truth, insisted that his will be respected. A marvelous witness was then given, and 600 persons—two thirds of the village population, practically everybody who was not out in the fields because of urgent work—attended the funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The matter of military service has meant great tribulation for the brothers whom they tried to force to compromise, but in vain. A jailer had one brother thrown into a cistern, where he had to stay for some time. Others were left for days without food in order to break their resistance. All these evil deeds have been unsuccessful, because the brothers did not deny their faith. The brothers do not get weak but rather are strengthened in such Christian warfare. Many people of good will learn the truth from them and return from prison as Jehovah’s witnesses. The courageous attitude of our brothers proves that the love of Christ is stronger than all the power of the enemy. They have taken to heart the words of the apostle Paul at Romans 8: 35-39 and can apply them to themselves.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark272"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness his witnesses in India have enjoyed another year of progress in their preaching work. All the features of service have shown an increase except that of public meetings, where they had a few less than last year. For the first time we find more than a thousand publishers in India who engaged in the field service. A new peak of 1,003 was reached, with the average for the year being 965. While the Society has many missionaries there we now find there is difficulty in sending any more in, but we continue to try and from time to time we are successful. The real work is now being done by local special pioneers. We hope to add more to the list during the coming year so that a wider witness may be given in this great country. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences and they are herewith related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your instructions to put more special pioneers on the list were much appreciated. This provision enabled two to go straight into the full-time ministry from congregations, while many who previously were regular pioneers were enabled to devote more time to the preaching work, with more efficiency and less distracting anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A step forward was made during the year in the publication of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in Tamil as a monthly magazine. This is at present mimeographed, but the circulation has reached a thousand copies of each issue regularly, and it is a great help to the Tamil-reading brothers in India, Ceylon and some other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While there is obviously a stiffening-up of resentment on the part of many of the more orthodox Hindus against any form of Christian Bible preaching there does not appear to be any inclination on the part of the ruling powers to interfere with the free proclamation of Bible truths, and for this we are glad and grateful. The fact remains, however, that the average Hindu shows no willingness to investigate the Bible, but proudly persists in accepting his ancient mythologies as truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a town where a missionary home had recently been opened we held a circuit assembly. The home servant writes: &quot;The assembly certainly awoke all to the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses were in town, and now a wave of opposition has followed from the churches. Sermons have been preached against us and in some cases the clergy have gone from house to house in order to stop members of their flock from studying with us. Their objections are based on two false statements: that we have our own Bibles, and that we do not believe in Christ. The first we counteract by always having the householder use his own Bible, and the second is shown to be unfounded but generally leads to a discussion of the ‘trinity.’ The result of all this has been that when the circuit servant visited the town he was invited to address some students of the university, and later a series of eight talks were arranged in collaboration with the local Christian community.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Roman Catholics are usually very fearful of reading anything not published by their church, but in India we find the most fruitful ground among Roman Catholic communities. There is the case of a young man of twenty-one who has now taken a firm stand for the truth. His parents desired that he should be educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood and they sent him to a Roman Catholic institution in Portuguese Goa. On his return home in poor health he took up a job in an office in Trivandrum, where one of our brothers worked. This brother tactfully talked to this young man about the truths of the Bible and answered his many objections, as he believed the Roman Catholic Church alone taught the truth. But when all his questions were answered from the Bible he began to take interest and a home Bible study was started. It was not long before he became convinced that he was really learning the truth and could see the errors of the Roman Catholic doctrines. He was formerly a member of the “Legion of St. Mary” at Trivandrum, and this organization tried vainly to break his integrity to Jehovah. It was this same man who helped the circuit servant find the addresses of the names handed in at the Trivandrum circuit assembly when he went there on his back-call work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark273"></a>INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Indonesia are scattered throughout the territories. There are a number in Java, Sulawesi and Sumatra, and reports have come in from the branch servant of work accomplished in these three places. There is a tremendous territory to cover in Indonesia and there is a great cry for workers. A number of those who had been in the truth have migrated to other lands, so during the year thirty publishers were lost, but despite this there was an increase. On the island of Java alone they have reached a new peak of 230 publishers. This is very gratifying and it encourages the brothers throughout all of the vast territory of Indonesia to press on. The congregations are healthy and are increasing, and it is the sincere hope of the brothers that many more will enter the special pioneer service and so reach out into different large cities to begin congregations. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences from the different islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The outstanding event for 1956 was the visit of Brother Knorr and Brother Adams, and the coinciding national assembly in Djakarta. This was the first national assembly for Indonesia. Many traveled long distances to be at this assembly. Ten brothers and sisters, some with small children, traveled eight days by ship from the northern tip of Sulawesi. As they were unable to afford cabins, all traveled on the open deck. They were overjoyed at being able to be with their brothers at this upbuilding assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a very great need for pioneers to develop the interest in the many towns of Java. We have the circuit servant keep in regular contact with the isolated interest. Spending a few days in each place he is able to hold studies, give Bible lectures and take some of the more advanced ones with him in the field service. In this way interest has been developed in most of the towns of some size in Java. Here are some of his experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He writes: “We are thrilled at seeing the progress of the Kingdom work in J---. Six months ago we contact</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ed a Javanese girl about twenty years of age. She had heard of the message previously, when living with her</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sister in Surabaja. She used to attend the home Bible study held by one of the missionaries with her sister. Later she returned to live with her father in J----.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Receiving her name on a good-will slip we endeavored to contact her. This was very difficult, as the street where she lived was unknown, but finally we contacted her. Imagine the joy of the girl when we came to help her. She was wondering if she would ever be visited by Jehovah’s witnesses in J----. How</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">quickly she grasped and absorbed all we told her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Our latest visit this week has done her much good. Her father is very much opposed and wishes to force her to remain Islam, but to no avail. She asked about baptism. She has still one year to go before finishing high school, and now that she knows the truth her desire is to be a pioneer. She has witnessed to all her school friends and distributed literature among them. She asked us to come back as soon as possible and take her out in the field service again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In the same town, while buying bread, we did not forget to dispense the spiritual bread and left some tracts with the storekeeper. Two days later we received a note saying the storekeeper’s father wished to see us. A lively discussion was held with him and his wife. He had long disagreed with most church doctrines. He was amazed when he heard the clear message of truth. ‘What a pity,’ he exclaimed, ‘that you did not come here ten years earlier. It is such a clear message, and you Jehovah’s witnesses live up to your name.’ He subscribed for both magazines and took all the books we had.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark274"></a>SULAWESI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In Minahasa, the northern tip of Sulawesi, much interest has been located among these predominantly ‘Christian,’ Bible-respecting people. There is a great need for pioneers or missionaries in this area to expand the work out beyond the congregation of Manado. At a recent circuit assembly 525 persons were present to see the film “The New World Society in Action,” indicating the extent of interest here. Much work will be needed, though, to develop this interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">House-to-house work in the city of Makassar on the southern tip of the island reveals that there are many honest-hearted and inquiring minds in this area. While walking to the territory a man with whom a casual acquaintance was made at the lodging place called out inquiring if the circuit servant would please come in and tell him something about the Bible and answer a few questions that had been troubling him. He proved to be a real sheep. Several Bible talks were given at his home and he invited his relatives to attend. He offered to take the lead in a weekly Bible study using one of the Society’s publications.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark275"></a>SUMATRA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Among the 600,000 'Christians’ around the Toba Lake area in North Sumatra, a fertile field presents itself and interest can be found almost everywhere and in unexpected ways. While stopping for a day in a small town nestled among the mountains along Toba Lake, the circuit servant contacted a lady who showed keen interest and invited the circuit servant to return in the evening when her husband would be home. The circuit servant writes: “In the evening when I returned there was a lot of activity in the neighborhood. The lady cheerfully told me she had invited many of her neighbors to meet me and that I must give them a sermon and relate experiences. About forty persons assembled in the course of the evening, including ten or twelve schoolteachers. I gave a general talk on our work and pointed out that the Kingdom was the main theme of the Bible and especially of Jesus’ teaching, and that this Kingdom was now at hand. A more attentive and eager audience would be hard to find. Cocoa was served after my talk, and then began questions for about the next two hours. Unusual is the interest shown by the young people, who had many intelligent questions to ask, such as now one should pray, about the spirit, how one can learn to overcome evil thoughts and ways, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“When it was close to ten o’clock I suggested they would have many of their questions answered if they subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> Eight subscriptions were obtained and all the books I had were placed. I was heartily thanked for my talk and answers to their questions. They expressed the hope that I would return soon, as it was not often they had someone call on them and give them information on the Bible.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark276"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Much progress has been made in the Kingdom work in Italy during the 1956 service year. The New World society reached a new all-time peak in publishers of 3,491 in April. Excellent progress is being made in all features of the work. More hours were devoted to witnessing, more subscriptions were obtained and there was a marvelous increase in the distribution of the magazines </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> There was also an increase in back-calls and Bible studies. The brothers are joyful over the progress even though they met up with much opposition. The branch servant in Rome gives us a report on some of the interesting experiences in Italy itself as well as in the country of Libya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Imagine the happiness of a brother when he returned to make a call on a magazine placement and found that seventeen persons were interested in the truth! Despite the efforts of Satan to plant tares among these, four Bible studies were started. In the home of one of these studies an area Bible study was started with an average of twenty persons attending each week. Now these have become active, zealous publishers. Of these, eight have been baptized and one has made an application for pioneer service. Others are also talking of pioneering. The prospects are that soon a congregation will be formed. Thus we see how one magazine brought much joy and increase to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers are zealous in preaching out of season as well. In a large prison a congregation is being formed with those who are prisoners. Some of these were members of the world-famous Giuliano band. The former leader of this famous band (which has been broken up) is now a brother. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment. Though these brothers are in bonds they say that ‘the gospel is not bound’ and they are actively engaged in preaching the good news. Guards and prisoners are coming to a knowledge of the truth. Some prisoners have made a formal request to the Ministry of Interior to have their names taken off the list as being Catholics, as they are now Jehovah’s witnesses. As a result of the preaching of these brothers the truth has spread to another prison where the brothers have taken a similar step to have themselves declared as Jehovah’s witnesses. How did this all start? A pioneer had been imprisoned for preaching without a license. While waiting for trial he preached “in troublesome season” and he was able to plant this seed that has brought forth so much fruit. Now almost every Sunday a public talk is given in prison with about thirty present to listen to the Bible lecture. Good results have already been obtained from these lectures, and regular meetings are being held. From time to time these brothers send out names of persons who are relatives of the prisoners who are interested in the truth and who want to be visited. It is difficult to know just how many are coming to a knowledge of the truth as a result of this “in troublesome season” preaching of these faithful brothers who are trying to serve Jehovah with all their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The position of a person toward the truth should not be judged by us, as the following well illustrates. About eight years ago the mailman bringing the mail to the branch office received a witness, but he refused the message, being rather opposed. Nevertheless, during all these years a friendly relationship was maintained with him. One day this year one of the brothers at Bethel had the occasion to discuss the subject of the truth with him. A booklet was given him. Later he was given a magazine and soon thereafter he obtained a subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> The brother from Bethel started visiting him at his home and soon his wife and children became interested in the truth. Now they are all studying the Bible together and they are regularly attending the congregation meetings. The wife has started talking to her friends and now one of them is having a Bible study in her home as well. So one’s first rejecting the truth does not mean that one will not later accept it when the occasion arises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wonderful to note are the several legal victories that Jehovah has granted us through various means this year. The Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Cassation of Rome and the Council of State have all given us favorable verdicts that have given Italy more freedom of worship than at any time in its modern history, with the result that arrests against Jehovah’s witnesses have completely stopped. Prior to these verdicts a considerable increase in the number of police arrests had been noted. Before us there is really a wide-open door, which Jehovah has opened so that we might be able to preach this gospel even more than in the past.—Rev. 3: 8.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark277"></a>LIBYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This past year saw continued opposition to the preaching work in Libya. The brothers have had a difficult time of it and the persecution has cut down the amount of service being done. Yet despite all this the brothers are going strong and are courageously serving Jehovah as best they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service year started off by having the congregation servant and his family expelled from the country. Almost all the brothers in Libya are Italians and this same threat was held over their heads to make them quit the preaching work. However, the brothers kept on preaching as best they could, taking care of the interest and even doing door-to-door work. This was difficult because at times the police would follow them when they would leave their homes so that they might catch the brothers preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Seeing that threats had not stopped the work, the Catholic Church put more pressure on the police and they began raiding and searching the homes of the brothers and having them come to police headquarters for questioning. The newspapers declared that a clandestine organization had been broken up by brilliant police work over many months and that now Jehovah’s witnesses were to go to trial. The Catholic Church rejoiced over this police action in her newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, not all the people were in harmony with this action. The newspapers began carrying letters written by an educated man protesting against this action and defending freedom of worship for all. A priest answered this man through the newspapers and between the two began a newspaper debate that really shamed the church, as this man showed the historical wickedness of the Catholic Church by citing very telling historical events. All this gave much publicity to Jehovah’s witnesses and they have become well known in Libya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers have been very firm in their determination to keep serving Jehovah no matter what may happen. In fact the brothers have come through all this trouble much stronger than ever before, and indications are that we shall soon be having good increases again in this nation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark278"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Another happy year of Kingdom service has come to a close and Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica are very pleased with the grand privilege they have had as ministers of the Kingdom. There have been remarkable increases in the distribution of the magazines, and it is hoped that with this wider circulation many of the other sheep will be found. A number of Jehovah’s witnesses living there had to find employment in other parts of the world and about a hundred brothers left for England. This cut in considerably on the increase in publishers that might have been shown in Jamaica for the 1956 service year. However, the brothers have had real enjoyment in preaching the good news in both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. The branch servant gives us some interesting items in his annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One congregation had allowed over 500 magazines to pile up when the call came to order more magazines for the April campaign. How could more magazines be ordered and all be placed? By careful planning and all in the congregation sharing in magazine activity! Arrangements were made for special group work in territory that did not receive regular coverage. With seventy-four brothers sharing in the work on just one day of special effort 824 magazines were placed! This is sure evidence that magazine distribution can be increased and quotas can be reached if all plan for Magazine Day work and then fully share in the activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Magazine Day work in business territory can be very fruitful. Publishers have been able to place as many as thirty to forty magazines in two hours of store-to-store work. Calling back on placements has resulted in one missionary and his wife’s starting eight Bible studies in just a few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A fine witness and favorable impression can be given by employed brothers to their ‘masters in a fleshly sense.’ A businessman gladly received the message presented to him by a missionary, accepted literature and desired to make a further contribution to the work, saying: &quot;Do you think I don’t know what good you people are doing here? I have several of Jehovah’s witnesses working for me. They always give me a good day’s work, they are cheerful, and I can be certain that they will not steal any of my stock.” Jehovah’s witnesses truly are different and it is evident in more ways than just their manner of preaching and their message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is gathering men of all nations from the old world into his New World society. Having left the old-world ways it is necessary that they remain clean and separate, living exemplary lives. It brings much sadness when brothers turn aside from the profitable course they have been following and turn again to the mire of the old world. During this past service year it was actually necessary to disfellowship one and a half percent of our brothers! Yes, even servants in some of the congregations. While this does grieve us, yet it must be remembered that Jehovah has called his people out of this old world and he requires that they remain clean and we have the satisfaction of knowing that the organization is being kept clean and free from reproach. There is every need for all brothers to take up the complete suit of armor from God, not allowing their senses to become dulled and their fighting equipment to become rusty through lack of use. Regularity in study, in meeting attendance and in field service are essentials. There is extreme danger in letting our guard down for even a little while.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>CAYMAN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">From the very week of the missionaries’ arrival the clergy were busy warning their flocks of the false prophets that had arrived in the island. Most persons, however, paid little attention to them and many expressed their favor for the truth, so much so that some were saying, ‘The whole island is following the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses.’ One woman said: “The more my minister keeps telling me you are false prophets, the more I find you are speaking the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our district servant was also able to visit the islands, showing the film to more than 300 in the capital, George Town. When he and one of the missionaries went to the smaller island of Cayman Brae they found a religious revival in progress. He wrote: “The owner of the only theater agreed to its use for the showing of the film, but later, under influence of his Southern Baptist minister, asked to have a preview first, with his pastor present. This was agreed to, but the pastor became belligerent and tried to start a fight on doctrinal matters. It was pointed out to him that it was not our purpose to fight with anyone whether pastor or layman, for the Bible says ‘the servant of the Lord does not need to fight, but should be apt to teach and helpful toward all.’ We offered to sit down at an appointed time during our stay and have a reasonable, calm, Scriptural discussion on any point he chose. Those listening to the conversation noised it about that the film would be shown that evening at the theater and instead of a private preview, thirty-five persons followed inside and saw the film. The only ones not liking it were the parson and his right-hand man. The parson objected to the film’s being shown and induced the owner to cancel the arrangements he had made with us. Many persons expressed their disapproval, for they could see no harm in the film. A generator was obtained and the film was still shown four times. Many came to see because of the curiosity aroused by the clergyman’s opposition. Very good interest was found in the one-week visit to this island and it is hoped that this will be cared for shortly.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark280"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is yet a tremendous work to be done among the teeming millions of people of Japan, but during the last year a good witness has been given. The brothers had a 27-percent increase in the number of publishers, and everyone in Japan is trying to bring the new ones on to maturity, along with others associating with them day by day. In Jehovah’s strength all of them will press on confidently, looking forward to the time when a little one will actually become a thousand and then many thousands will be praising the name of Jehovah. This is the desire of all of the New World society in Japan: to gather together the great crowd that the Kingdom witnesses there are confident exist in Japan. The great problem, as in many other parts of the earth, is to find them. With just 592 publishers in all of that territory it means diligence on the part of everyone, and this is exactly the spirit that is being shown by the brothers. They are not letting their hands droop, but they are putting in many more hours and have placed many more subscriptions and have distributed many more magazines during the past year. Not only that, the brothers have spent more time in the important work of back-calling and conducting Bible studies. This is no time to slack the hand, but this is the time to express to Jehovah God the appreciation of the bountiful blessings he has showered upon them, and to move ahead in his strength. The branch servant in Tokyo gives us some very interesting reports of the work in Japan, Okinawa and Taiwan. All of these experiences will make our hearts glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was another year of prosperity and joy, for which we praise Jehovah! It was a year of increase, gaining irrepressible momentum with the April visit of Brothers Knorr and Adams, and the never-to-be-forgotten assembly in Tokyo at that time. April, May, June and July all saw new peaks of publishers, culminating in 592, a 27-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The local newspaper in a special pioneer assignment published a good article on the assembly and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> The special pioneers have had many interesting experiences as a result. One rainy day they sought shelter in a hospital and started witnessing to a nurse. Overhearing them, a doctor came from inside, took the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, and said: &quot;Oh, I read about this in the newspaper. Twenty-five yen per copy? But how about the whole year?” He Immediately subscribed for the year. A teacher in the local high school read the article about Jehovah’s witnesses. He wrote to the pioneers, and they visited him. He obtained a subscription and took all the literature they had. Next Sunday he began attending the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study and started a personal study. The pioneers received a number of other letters and postcards, one of which read: “On reading about </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in the newspaper, I should like to become a member. Wouldn’t you please send me your rules?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The blind are beginning to see! A Japanese pioneer studied with a person who had been blind from childhood. After some months the mother told the pioneer that she had asked different religions to bring her daughter comfort, but because there was no money in it for them, they had all given up. Now the parents were greatly impressed that Jehovah’s witnesses should show this care for their daughter, and they came with her to hear Brother Knorr’s talk. They were thrilled with it. The daughter attends meetings regularly in the congregation and publishes. This same pioneer started to study with another young woman who was deaf and part blind. The study had to be conducted simply and with much repetition, by writing the Japanese phonetic characters with the finger in the person’s palm. As they became absorbed in the study, the pioneer’s finger really ached at times. The blind person has now turned from the worship of Kitsune (“the fox”) and is a witness of the true God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Osaka an eighty-four-year-old man, who is almost blind, was recently immersed. He has to use two large magnifying glasses to read, and, even so, can read for only ten minutes at a time. However, he quickly understood the truth and became a preacher of it. He has to take an umbrella in the summer to keep out the direct sunlight, and in winter four pairs of thick socks fail to keep out the cold. But he preaches in all seasons. In six months from his baptism he had averaged thirty-six hours’ preaching a month and had placed 585 books, booklets and magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As another service year commences there are thirty-two special pioneers on the list in Japan, to compare with ten a year ago. These have brought in much of the increase during the past year. One zealous group of widowed mother, son and daughter started off January 1 with many interesting experiences among Buddhists, Shintoists and professed Christians and established fifteen studies in the first month. By August they had a congregation established, with ten publishers. Some new publishers from special pioneer assignments are themselves becoming pioneers, which all adds to the witness given. The special pioneer service has now spread the witness into the four main islands of Japan, opening up vast, untouched territory in this land of 90,000,000 souls.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>OKINAWA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work has continued apace in Okinawa, and once again there has been a fine increase in publishers, with a peak of twenty-six. Two special pioneer brothers have gone there from Japan, to help in organizing the work. Several new publishers were immersed during the year, and these have shown great zeal for the magazine work, even placing as many as a hundred magazines in one month. The special pioneers placed more than twice their quota of magazines and the congregation publishers more than four times their quota over the year. The Okinawan people enjoy reading the Japanese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> A total of 453 subscriptions was obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s film was again shown during the year. One of these showings was in a country village where much interest had been manifested. The village chief himself went round and invited everyone. At the appointed time, someone went out with an ax and struck the large village gong, summoning everyone to attend. The entire village came and applauded heartily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The small congregation in Okinawa is a united band of many nationalities. During the year the publishers included Japanese, Americans, Filipinos, Germans and Koreans, but they all seem to understand one another; at least all speak the one New World language. This happy group was delighted to meet with Brother Knorr during his recent tour of the Far East, even if for only a few minutes at the airport.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark282"></a>TAIWAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The year in Taiwan has brought increased freedom, and there have been many joyful experiences. This joy reached its peak in the successful one-day assembly on April 19, in which Brothers Knorr and Adams participated. Just one day, but what a day! The Taiwan brothers had been preparing for this assembly during eighteen years. Eighteen years of preparation for a one-day assembly? Yes, for since Jehovah’s witnesses first started to organize in Taiwan they had faced nine years of persecutions under the Japanese and another nine years of combating restrictions and misunderstandings under the Chinese. Now for the first time they were able to meet in one group in perfect freedom! How sweet that first taste of freedom of assembly! How appropriate that the president of the Watch Tower Society should speak to that eager throng of 1,808, and that he should climax the assembly with the talk “Christians Must Be Happy!” Jehovah’s witnesses of Taiwan were overflowing with happiness on that day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By year’s end registration of twenty-nine of the thirty-two Kingdom Halls in Taiwan had been completed, and meetings were in full swing. This has been a year of building and reorganizing for “peace time” conditions. It was necessary to change over to the Chinese and Ami languages in conducting meetings. The congregation servants, who had spoken Japanese all their lives, voluntarily went up to Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, for three months’ schooling in Chinese, for which the government provided a teacher, free of charge. In the course of this reorganization there was a falling off in the publisher average. However, the congregation servants returned home for a big effort to end the service year, and this brought the joyful result of a new peak of 1,907 publishers, a 29-percent increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers had to overcome many obstacles in order to show the film throughout their home territory. A gasoline generator was bought to run the machine. This generator and the gasoline have been transported around for hundreds of miles by brothers on foot, and in places by bicycle. Often it was hard work to get there through the scorching sun for the next night’s showing. But was it worth it? During the year four months of activity with the movie brought a total attendance of 48,357. In a town where two Taiwanese special pioneers had just started working, 4,500 people came out to see one showing of the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Witnessing in Taiwan one has to contend with local customs. There is a superstition that a new religion will bring death to a village, and that if a preacher of another religion stays overnight in a house the local gods will depart from that house. The villagers usually prefer the preacher to depart, and as he does so, they throw rice or salt after him. When the preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses takes hold in a village, it becomes a village issue, and often half the villagers will ultimately take their stand with the New World society. There is now one village district of more than 800 persons, all of whom are Jehovah’s witnesses, right down to the local mayor. These are divided into seven units, meeting in seven newly constructed Kingdom Halls. These brothers have to walk for many hours, often all through the night, to find territory where they can witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two Gilead-trained missionaries have now started to work in Taipei, and these are studying hard in the mandarin Chinese language. After six months they can give a good witness in Chinese at the doors, and they now have some good studies with people who do not know any English, so that Chinese is completely the language of instruction. The missionaries are now cooperating with the local publishers for further increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is real satisfaction in accomplishing work, especially work pertaining to the honor of Jehovah’s name and the advertising of his kingdom. When one is really busy, as are the brothers in Korea, then the year just flies by and all associated with this right kind of work are joyful. The New World society in Korea has had reed satisfaction this year, for they have seen marvelous increases. Their hours in the field, the number of magazines distributed, the back-calls made, the Bible studies conducted, all of these features of the service have gone ahead by leaps and bounds. Now that the year has come to a close and they have turned in an excellent report they are looking forward to the 1957 service year with great expectation. The New World society in Korea is better able and better equipped to preach the word this season than at any time before. These splendid workers will “from day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The ministers in Korea have had so many interesting experiences that it is impossible to publish all of them here, but some are taken from the report of the branch servant that will make our hearts glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The outstanding event of the year for us was the visit of Brother Knorr and Brother Adams. The good it accomplished is even now still manifesting itself in many ways. The president of the Society had never visited Korea before. Now he and the “channel” organization he represents are something really personal to the Korean brothers. It warms the heart to hear such expressions as “our Society” and “our Brother Knorr.” Koreans usually use such expressions only when they take something really unto themselves and reserve them primarily for expressing close family relationships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One man who attended a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses for the first time when Brother Knorr gave his public lecture in Seoul stadium was baptized at a circuit assembly held just a week before this writing and is a most zealous publisher. Yet it is less than five months since Brother Knorr’s visit. He had not studied before, but after that assembly last spring he attended one of the congregations regularly and studied diligently. He is well educated and already has been influential in causing a number of others to take up the truth seriously. Another middle-aged man was recently immersed with his entire family, including his wife and married daughter and father-in-law, who was a devout religionist. It is unusual for an entire family to take up the truth at the same time in Korea; so this example was encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much good publicity was experienced during Brother Knorr’s visit, but the best was reserved for the Sunday after he had gone. In the meantime the candidate of the opposition party for the presidency suddenly died of a heart attack. The next day’s newspaper (Sunday edition) was undoubtedly the most widely read issue of a Korean paper in many years. That was the issue in which one large Seoul daily carried a full summary of Brother Knorr’s lecture. It was accurately done, too, and better publicity for the Kingdom message could hardly have been planned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One problem has been that some people are baptized so soon that they have not had a deep enough knowledge upon which to build toward maturity. Brother Knorr’s instructions to limit baptisms between assemblies has helped much. He recognized the need for maturity and counseled missionaries and publishers alike to strive for this. Koreans do not come into the truth easily or take it lightly. It takes a real battle for each one. But a common characteristic is that once he begins to see that it is the truth he does not hold back, he wants to learn and do all he can and will therefore dedicate and request baptism even with only a bare fundamental knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Much of the pioneer work done during the year has been done by vacation pioneers, particularly during the months of January and August. Almost 300 reports were received during the year from vacation pioneers. Many find they can vacation pioneer two or three months during the year. One sister tells us how the vacation pioneer work strengthened her spiritually. She has three small children and a husband who is opposed to the truth. Until she vacation pioneered her record card showed her to be weak in Bible studies. When the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> called for vacation pioneers she took it to heart and with her three children, one tied on her back and one carrying her book bag and the other hanging on to one hand, she witnessed. She started one Bible study, two, then three, till she had five studies going. She had her hands full keeping her children in tow, but by the month’s end she had made her time and had kept up her humble home. She has not much of this world’s goods but she is rich spiritually from her experience. It takes real work for these sisters to be vacation pioneers for even one month. There are no modern conveniences; time is bought by getting up before daylight and carrying in the day’s supply of water. Ironing is tiring work—accomplished by the rhythmic beat of the round sticks beating the wrinkles out against a granite ironing stone. This has to be done at night to borrow time. Cooking takes hours on a little one-burner charcoal pot. But real love for the service of the King overcomes these things and these sisters have found real happiness in being vacation pioneers even for a month. But it is moving to know how dearly they have bought the time they use. The sister mentioned above has since kept her five Bible studies going and is now serving to assist others like her into the Bible study field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We were happy to see the distribution of individual magazines more than double that of the previous year. Certainly the year has served to make the publishers more magazine-conscious. One of the largest congregations has passed its nine-magazine-per-publisher quota in the last six months running. The reason for its success is the service center magazine activity in the early evening just before the congregation book study. It has been found to be an ideal time to witness. In several groups the entire group attending participate in the magazine activity prior to the study. This congregation has the right outlook. It does not get dismayed or awed at the big bank buildings and department stores, but rather looks at them as wonderful opportunities for placing magazines. Sometimes twenty or thirty magazines are placed in one bank or one department store. The brothers choose the more experienced ones for these places. They tactfully work through the managers to the other clerks. Certainly it is the positive attitude that places magazines, and this congregation has set a fine example for others to follow.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark284"></a>LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The witness given throughout the Arabic-speaking territory has continued with good effect during the past year, but not without a great deal of opposition. As to the number of publishers in the field, it has been less than at previous times, but the interest in the truth has been greater than ever before, because of wide publicity. Lebanon itself experienced a crippling earthquake that struck the southern part of the country shortly after a terrorizing flood wiped out much life and property in the north. On top of these disasters in the country there has been a tense political situation, as the Middle East is facing a great crisis. In all of this turmoil Jehovah’s witnesses have continued to bring comfort to the bewildered people and have pointed them to the Scriptures showing that there would be many world disturbances, which would mark the end of this system of things and the beginning of a new and righteous government. So the New World society moves on triumphantly preaching God’s kingdom. Throughout the territory of Lebanon approximately half the people are so-called Christians and the other half are Moslem. But in other territories handled under the direction of the branch in Lebanon the majority of the people are of the Moslem faith. The reports that follow give items of interest from Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because Jehovah’s witnesses mention the name Jehovah and talk about the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, everywhere throughout that part of the world they are accused of being Zionists or a Zionist front, and it takes a long explanation to show anyone that we have nothing to do with the Jews returning to Palestine. However, even against opposition the message of the Kingdom must be preached and our brothers in these lands appreciate the problem and know how to handle it. They will continue to preach despite all opposition. Excerpts from the branch servant’s report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because of the great hatred between Jews and Arabs, anyone of Jewish origin faces many difficulties in the Arab states, as does any group or organization that should have the misfortune to be falsely labeled Jewish or Zionist, such as Jehovah’s witnesses. Yet nothing could be farther from the truth in our case, for the Jewish people rarely accept our message and become true Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year it was interesting, therefore, to see one Jewish girl who had first contacted the truth here and then later in Turkey return and with a little encouragement begin in the field service. Shortly after this she dedicated herself to Jehovah and fully accepted the responsibilities of Christianity, and has walked in that path ever since. Her family was very upset and they themselves, although Jewish, accused her of being part of a Zionist organization. However, she has let nothing stand in the way of her dedication and today she is a pioneer, bearing witness to all about the establishment of Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It can honestly be said that here as well as elsewhere the brothers are not lazy. The circuit servant reports that in one small isolated community at the foot of Mt. Hermon of Bible fame live a group of zealous publishers. In the summertime, early in the morning when the rays of the sun are just beginning to glisten off the patches of eternal snow on top of Mt. Hermon, the brothers below in the still half-darkness before full daylight are already up and loading in a bus at 4 a.m. Arriving in their territory by 6 a.m. they spend several hours witnessing and then often return home on foot in the afternoon, as there is no afternoon bus service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The releasing of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in Armenian during the year was another high point, and this year has been our best yet in the distribution of the Society’s magazines. During the month of April an all-time high was reached in this work as the brothers distributed the magazines far and wide. All of this work did not go unnoticed by the clergy, for from April on many different tracts were published against us and some were even distributed in the churches. This campaign was carried on not by the Moslems but by the so-called “Christians.” As the months wore on the leading Arabic weekly in Lebanon published a vicious article against Jehovah’s witnesses and called upon ‘all responsible government officials and newspapers to take up the fight and to throw this gang of Zionists out of the country.’ The brothers protested immediately and the magazine consented to the printing of a shorter version of our side of the story. Additionally a well-known Arabic writer also had an article in our favor written and submitted it at the same time, although he was unknown to us before. So in this way a really powerful witness was given and spread throughout the Arab States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">June brought the stopping of all subscribers’ copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> by the post office, and in July the government officially outlawed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in all languages, again officially saying that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">was Zionist propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But in spite of this the spirit of the brothers remains good, and as one congregation servant wrote shortly after the banning took place: “The government order is to arrest everyone who violates the decree, but, if necessary, we can approach the people with the other literature, and if they ban our literature we shall go to the people with the Bible and sermons; we shall avoid trouble as much as possible, so long as we do not contradict God’s Word.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>IRAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In May of this service year two special pioneers began working in Teheran, Iran. For some years prior to that there had been no publishers working in the country. Conditions are bad and the special pioneers write that morals generally are very low, making it difficult for a sister to work alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite these conditions, however, we are informed by the pioneers that there appear to be many persons of good will in the territory. Shortly after arriving they were conducting three Bible studies, with from four to five in attendance at each study. The Persian people by nature are hospitable, but when it comes to religious discussions they become very fanatical. Often they will bring the Koran and say that this is what they believe and that it is better than any Bible. It will take patience and perseverance on the part of Jehovah’s people to find those of the other sheep among these hospitable but blinded ones. Three publishers in all are reporting from Iran now. A start has been made and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness it will continue to grow during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark286"></a>IRAQ</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Missionaries were first sent to Iraq in 1953, but in this predominantly Moslem land the work of preaching Jehovah’s kingdom has not spread rapidly. During the year, however, Iraq’s first congregation was organized in the ancient capital city of Baghdad, situated on the banks of the Tigris River. This was a happy event for the new brothers there. They are happy to be able to meet together and carry on their ministry in an organized way. The weather is very hot and during the summer months witnessing can be done only in the forenoon and in the evening. To be on the streets during the hot part of the day would invite sunstroke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the first time this year the film “The New World Society in Action” was shown to the brothers in Iraq during the visit of the zone servant, and this helped the publishers and persons of good will to get a better appreciation of the size and scope of the New World society. Shortly thereafter the newly formed congregation arranged for a baptism in the nearby Tigris and four new brothers symbolized their dedication: one a former Moslem, one a Protestant, one a Catholic and one an Orthodox church member. Certainly the truth of Jehovah’s Word unites men of all nations and walks of life. The Moslem had been looking for the truth for ten years and is now rejoicing at having found it and is having an active share in proclaiming it to others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>JORDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Today in this ever-shortening time of the end, the nations of this world seethe in political unrest. This is particularly true of the Jordan, as the country strives for more independence from the West, while at the same time incident after incident erupts along the Jordan-Israel border, keeping tension high. It is under these conditions that Jehovah’s witnesses preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The attitude of the government toward Jehovah’s witnesses is still one of nonrecognition. While they have not physically interfered with the brothers this year, yet they will not allow literature to be freely shipped into the country, and they remain firm in their opposition to permitting missionaries to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To this day there remains in Jerusalem the aqueduct built by King Hezekiah to supply cooling and refreshing water to the inhabitants of Jerusalem during the siege of King Sennacherib. That aqueduct and its underground water supply are still in use, but today the aqueduct has a spiritual significance of much greater value than simply the supplying of local inhabitants with water, for it pictures the channel of cooling and refreshing waters of truth that, although unseen, continue to flow to Jehovah’s people in all the earth where Satan, the greater Sennacherib, with his opposition elements bans and opposes the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This year through this spiritual aqueduct, and unnoticed, flowed the Society’s publications and the film “The New World Society in Action.” The showing of the film was one of the high points of the year for the Jordanian brothers, and they were truly delighted to see how the theocratic organization smoothly operates all over the world. In Jerusalem over fifty people found their way through the crooked streets of the old city to the home of one of the sisters and there they were able to see how Jehovah is gathering out of all nations a people who will live forever under the heavenly Jerusalem, Jehovah's universal organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although the work goes slowly in the Jordan, because of its heavy Moslem population, yet there are ever new ones coming into the truth. Some take their stand without much seeming difficulty, while others undergo great tests of their new-found integrity to Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark288"></a>SAUDI ARABIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Again this year we are happy to write that reports have been coming through regularly from Saudi Arabia and that seeds of truth sown are producing fruit. Because there are no local publishers preaching there, the work continues to be carried on by brothers working in the oil fields who bring the truth with them from other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lone brother found there at the close of the year writes, saying that the hardest month for him was when a blistering article against Jehovah’s witnesses appeared in a leading Arabic weekly, accusing them of being a front organization for Zionism. However, by tactfully witnessing and pointing out from the Society’s publications the real position of Jehovah’s witnesses toward the Jewish question, he was able to convince several that the charges were false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems that this brother is able to spend many hours in the service witnessing to seamen sailing on board the many tankers that load oil in the Persian Gulf ports. One officer from a Norwegian tanker accepted some literature from the brother, and was so pleased with the information that on his return voyage he requested to see the brother personally and to thank him for the information and to inquire further. Although a Catholic, this officer admitted that the doctrines being taught in his church were not supported by the Bible. He was very grateful for the knowledge he had received from this lone brother there in the uttermost parts of the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark289"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">‘You will be brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake,’ said Jesus. The brothers in Syria certainly have experienced the fulfillment of these words during this service year. The entire year has been one of arrests and trials and more arrests. Brothers from every congregation in Syria were arrested, and by July, 1956, all the special pioneers had been arrested and were either in prison or out on bail waiting for trial. Of course, these tribulations have brought many opportunities to witness to those in official positions and the brothers have taken advantage of these opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s translator for the Arabic language was among those arrested during the year. When he was searched at the police station there were found in his possession two articles translated from English for the Arabic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> These were taken from him and he was questioned for two hours, after which he was locked in a small, bare room for four hours, even though he is an elderly man of sixty-nine. After this he was allowed to leave the police station on the promise that he would return the next morning. On his return the next day the brother asked them if they had read the articles. They said they had and commented on the outstanding logic as to why we should believe in God even though we cannot see him and even reread one of the paragraphs aloud. They asked the brother what he planned to do with the articles. They were told that the articles were to be published in the Arabic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and read all over the world by Arabic-speaking people. The brother was accused of being against the “heavenly” religions, whereupon he asked, If those religions are heavenly, why is there so much discord among them? and since Jehovah’s witnesses read the same Bible those religions do, are they not also a heavenly religion? Finally, the brother was escorted to the border and there even his Bible was confiscated. After this he was forbidden to return to Syria, even though members of his family live there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the first century it was the religious Jews of Damascus that persecuted the apostle Paul, but today in that city it is the political element goaded on by the religionists that opposes true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Through it all the brothers have earned the respect of even those taking them to trial. One district judge, in private conversation with an attorney defending Jehovah’s witnesses, said: “When a man is brought before us for murder or theft or gambling we know what his crime is. But what is the crime of these humble witnesses? Is their crime the preaching of the name Jehovah?” Another attorney said: “When we take a man who has involved himself in politics before the court and he is asked a question, he immediately becomes evasive. But when one of Jehovah’s witnesses is asked a question he tells everything, shows no fear, and is not ashamed.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark290"></a>LEEWARD ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There are some very small islands in the Caribbean Sea under the direction of the branch called Leeward Islands. Nothing spectacular occurred in these islands during the last year, but the publishers of the Kingdom are moving forward in some of the islands. In a few places the increases have been very good, and in others the congregations are just holding their own. But one thing can be said, and that is that all of the people on these islands have had an opportunity to hear the truth. The brothers are experiencing rich blessings and they fully appreciate, too, the need of maturity. They see that when an organization does not grow it is because of the fact that certain individuals are not attending meetings. They are not paying enough attention to personal study. They are not taking advantage of the training program. When one loses these things in the truth or does not pay enough attention to them, then he loses a great deal of joy that could be his. The branch servant has a very pleasant time visiting all of these islands and encouraging the brothers and working with them in the field, and he has sent in a brief comment on what has taken place in each of the islands: Antigua, Anguilla, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Martin and St. Eustatius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A missionary was hailed by a person who had read the special issue of the April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> He asked for six more copies to take to his hospitalized friends. Visiting the hospital, the missionary met one of the patients who had received a copy. He asked how he could subscribe. Upon release he immediately subscribed, now studies regularly and has attended some meetings, being very favorably impressed with the organization of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What can be accomplished by setting a goal and faithfully doing the back-call work? This: A young boy of fifteen years entered the vacation pioneer service for two weeks. As it was a bound-book campaign, he set as his goal 100 hours in the field and the placing of twenty bound books. Every home where he was told to come back later he faithfully returned to and gave his sermons. Imagine his joy when his report showed 100 hours, 23 bound books, 56 magazines and two studies, and this in a territory worked every few weeks.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark291"></a>ANGUILLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work received a serious setback early in the service year because of the immoral action of the pioneer working there. With the proper action taken, honest people were forced to see that the New World society stands firmly for righteous principles. A little disheartened by what has happened, the other publishers have continued to render service and keep the interest alive. How encouraging it was to these to have a zealous pioneer sister and her niece come from Curacao to spend three months’ vacation on the island! During their stay the work was built up considerably.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark292"></a>DOMINICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The servants of the New World society here are zealous, study diligently, attend their meetings and freely express themselves. Their joy knows no bounds at the results accomplished. Missionaries, vacation pioneers and diligent publishers have all contributed their part to the fine new peak of eighty-three publishers, and it is hoped that the 100 mark will soon be reached. Publishers here have a fine manner of welcoming the stranger. Without holding back, immediately when a new face appears, they step forward and say: “I am one Brother --- of La Roche. I am glad to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When new ones get baptized they step forward and express their joy at seeing them take this step. This makes new ones feel very welcome as a part of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a wonderful help assemblies are in giving new ones the spirit and joy of the organization! A schoolteacher from a Catholic school studied for a time with a local publisher and then with a missionary. Later she attended a circuit assembly in a village on the other side of the island. The circuit servant invited her to share in the service and this she did. The joy of association at the assembly strengthened her to take a definite stand for the truth. Upon returning home she asked for a transfer from the Catholic school to a public school. But first she had to write a letter stating her reasons for leaving and have this signed by the mother superior. In it she plainly stated that she no longer believed in Catholic doctrine, and for her to remain and teach it would be hypocritical. Deeply grieved, the mother superior said: “If only we had known you were studying the Bible with those Jehovah’s.” Said the teacher: “Jehovah is God, and why did you not teach me the Bible?” “No one can understand the Bible but the priest,” said the mother superior. “We will pray for you that you may come back.” The teacher replied: “You can pray all you like, but I have left for good.” Now being baptized and a regular publisher, she is experiencing the real joys of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark293"></a>MONTSERRAT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">I wonder if you have a magazine route like this: The congregation servant on the island regularly places about thirty or forty magazines a month. His magazine route is the police station! Most of the police love to read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> and many </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> What can just one issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> do? This: One officer</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">consistently refused to read any magazines. Later he picked up a copy of the issue with the article “Activity and Life versus Inactivity and Death.” So impressed was he that next time the publisher called he took six more copies and several bound books and has read every issue since. How important that we help the people to see what the journals contain and the import of their message!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark294"></a>NEVIS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Steady progress is being made on this island. The elderly pioneer, although just seventy years old, has accepted the invitation into special pioneer work and regularly surpasses his quota by thirty or forty hours. Certainly the joy of Jehovah is his strength. With the increased activity of the witnesses and effective sermons given at the doors, a sharper division of the people is taking place. Their work is effective and brings results.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark295"></a>ST. KITTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Illustrating the need of having a variety of sermons, a missionary reports how she was followed from one house to another by a person who liked each sermon given. A different sermon was given at each door until the missionary was wondering what to give next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Holiday witnessing brings good results. Congregations that take advantage of each holiday are sure to have success. On such an occasion a good-will person told a brother: “Never mind because lots of people are out enjoying pleasure; you will find many people who are glad to talk with you.” On such a campaign, in one house a brother placed seven magazines with a group of workmen. Do not be turned away by any trite objection. Said a householder to a publisher: “Everyone here belongs to a church; no need to come here with your literature.” Said the alert publisher: “That’s fine, just the type of people we like to talk to, because we can talk on Bible subjects.” A short sermon was given, a magazine was placed and a return call was arranged.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark296"></a>ST. MARTIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A Kingdom Hall was arranged for and an average of ten attend the meetings. The film “The Happiness of the New World Society” was shown in the open air and 500 attended and were very much impressed. Imagine the consternation on the part of the clergy. Catholic school children were told to tell their parents not to let the missionaries into their houses, and other ministers denounced them from the pulpit. All to no avail. As one person said: “It is only since you came that we have learned anything about the Bible.” The small group of brothers on the French side of the island continue to work away, and with the help of the missionaries the new year will show fine progress. Already a new peak of twelve publishers has been reached.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark297"></a>ST. EUSTATIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Good service has been rendered the good-will persons on this island by the regular visits of the circuit servant. There is much interest among the one thousand inhabitants and many have subscribed to the Society’s journals. One former Seventh-day Adventist has accepted the truth and has been started off in the work by the circuit servant. He has been turning in a report for a good many months now and seems to be growing to maturity. His report is included in the Antigua report. So another island adds its voice to the shout of praise that goes up daily to Jehovah and his kingdom and joins in the joyous activity of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark298"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Excellent progress is being made among Jehovah’s witnesses in the country of Liberia. They have reached a new all-time peak of 227 publishers declaring the good news of Jehovah’s triumphant kingdom. It is certainly heart-warming to know that into every nation, kindred and tongue Jehovah God has sent his people to preach, and gradually, not only in the large cities, but even in the jungles, the comforting message of Jehovah’s Word reaches people. It takes stick-to-itiveness to accomplish this work and we rejoice with the missionaries who have gone there. They must be happy because of seeing the prosperity of Jehovah’s service in their assignment. The branch servant in Liberia gives us some accounts of interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sister writes: “After two weeks of illness, which left me a little downhearted, I was glad to venture forth in store-to-store magazine work. Prayerfully I approached the first store. The thought of being able to preach again filled my heart with joy, and this must have been reflected in my face for the proprietress commented: ‘Although my god is Allah, I admire your friendly attitude. It would be fine if the whole world were friendly like you.’ She then willingly subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> At the next store a young Moslem countered that he was soon leaving the country, but when told that the magazine would follow him wherever he went he subscribed. The next proprietor objected: ‘I don’t agree with your literature, for it is in favor of the Jews, who say they are God’s people. I am an Arab and the Jews have killed many in my nation and have taken our country.’ Tactfully I pointed out that Jehovah has rejected the Jews as a nation because they rejected him and his King, saying: We have no king but Caesar!’ Therefore he is the God of the spiritual Jews (reading Romans 2: 28, 29), who take no part in killing. (2 Cor. 10: 3, 4) When he was convinced that his contribution would not be used to support worldly conflicts, he too subscribed. On and on I went until in a short time I obtained eight subscriptions!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although illiterate, a young fourteen-year-old girl progressed to the point where she was able to deliver a sermon at the doors. This fired her to learn to read and so she began attending school. Her extreme poverty prevented her from buying the necessary books, but she hoped to be able to look on in the books of her classmates. The first day in school she bowed her head during the devotion period, but her conscience troubled her because she realized that the prayer was not directed to Jehovah. The next day she refused to pray to the “triune” god, and the teachers indignantly ordered her to leave the school. When the matter was brought to the supervisor he called the teachers together and asked them to state their respective religions. Noting the different answers he said: “I am a Catholic. How would you like it if I made you bow to my religion because I am over you, and if you refused I should drive you from school and prevent you from teaching?” Readmitted, the young sister rendering exclusive devotion to Jehovah now stands with unbowed head during class prayers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Home life was not pleasant for one young husband, owing to the “palaver” his wife constantly made because he was spending most of his money on girl friends and good times and not supporting his wife and two children. Finally he sent the woman out of his home. About this time a close friend of his became one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and this caused him to investigate the message. When a brother questioned him about his wife, he rather proudly announced that he had put her away. No time was wasted in showing him his Scriptural responsibilities, and this brought about a deep change of heart. He then set out to gain his wife back. When the woman realized he was serious and he actually gave her money for the children she got up and started dancing from place to place, declaring: “I will serve this God, because now my husband calls me his wife and is showing love to me and the children again!” She now accompanies him in the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark299"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">An eventful service year has just come to a close for Jehovah’s witnesses in Luxembourg. During the very first month of their service year the president of the Society visited them, attended their Triumphant Kingdom assembly and organized a branch office in the city of Luxembourg. This two-day assembly was attended by brothers from Belgium, France, Germany and the Saar, and the great crowd of 1,312 that came to the public meeting certainly made an impression upon the people of this small country. For the first time the Luxembourg newspapers published favorable reports on the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since then the work has moved ahead very rapidly. The New World society enjoyed a 27-percent increase and they have a new peak of publishers of 183. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences that all of us will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the following months the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action” was shown twenty-one times to 576 persons, 276 of whom were people of good will and strangers. At the close of one showing a gentleman approached us and asked if we could show this film in the town where he lived and what the cost would be. He lives in the northern part of the country, where none of Jehovah’s witnesses are living. He looked for a suitable hall himself and also had the invitations distributed. By this means the way was opened up to us in this town, and six months later a four-day district assembly was held in this very same hall. Now Jehovah’s witnesses have become known in this region and we are sure that the fruits of their labors will be evident here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The missionaries had a Bible study with a woman and her three children (nine, eleven and fourteen years old). After the study had been held with them a while the mother decided to take the children away from the religious instruction at school. She knew that this step would bring her difficulties. At first her husband resisted, so she put the choice up to him. If he would insist upon having the children reared in the Catholic faith, then he would have to go to church and to mass and study the catechism with them. The man yielded and left the religious instruction to her. When the mother of this lady learned that her daughter and grandchildren were studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses she was enraged and forbade her daughter to enter her house as long as she should associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. Incidentally, the son and daughterin-law, who are both members of the godless Communist party, live in the same house with their mother. Evidently Bible study is more dangerous to Catholics than atheistic communism. The study was continued regularly with this woman and her three children. The children were given set homework to do each week. Soon all four were engaging in the preaching work and one after another symbolized his dedication to Jehovah by water immersion. Today they are all regular and zealous publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, all this was being watched by this woman’s sister and her husband. They had to admire her steadfastness and recognized the changes within this now-theocratic family. Years before this sister had obtained a Bible from Jehovah’s witnesses. Now it was brought out again. The two sisters began a home Bible study together. Soon the brother-in-law and the fifteenyear-old daughter were sitting in. A month later all three were at the circuit assembly and went in the field service for the first time, and have been publishing regularly ever since, and ten weeks later all three were baptized at the district assembly. Truly our stripping off the old personality and clothing ourselves with a new personality makes a favorable impression upon sincere people of good will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark300"></a>MAURITIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Five years ago the work started in the little island of Mauritius. The missionaries who were sent there covered the territory thoroughly and are continuing to cover it. Many have heard the good news and a few have realized its seriousness and have taken up the work of witnessing to their fellow man. Today there is an average of twenty-four reporting in the field. Last year a branch office was opened in Mauritius to look after the territory in that vicinity. The islands of La Reunion, Mauritius and Madagascar comprise the territory of the branch. It makes the missionaries very happy when they see the blessing of Jehovah upon their efforts. After years of hard work some definite results have been obtained and people have been found who are willing to take on the responsibility of preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. Some excerpts from the report of the new branch servant in Mauritius are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the beginning of the service year Brother M. G. Henschel visited Mauritius and set up a branch office of the Society to look after the New World interests in the three South Indian Ocean islands of Madagascar, La Reunion and Mauritius, all formerly under the jurisdiction of the South African branch. So this is our first report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We work with several ‘kinds of men.’ House-to-house missionaries carry literature in English, French, Hindi, Chinese, Urdu and Tamil, as well as a Bible in English and one in French. At a regular congregation </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study, using “Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator,” there were present five Mauritians, four Indo-Mauritians and one European. Former religious associations represented were Roman Catholic, Church of England, Plymouth Brethren, Presbyterian, Moslem and two sects of Hindus. So unification here is really practical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We had the pleasure of presenting for the first time in Mauritius the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action.” The superb organization of our factory, the international field of our operations, the unity of our people and in particular the immense size of the crowds at the great international conventions just thrilled our local friends. Thus gently persuaded Mauritians are getting the idea of bringing wife and family to the assembly, using the cafeteria and staying all day to get the most of the spiritual and temporal food. The film has greatly assisted the missionaries in their task of awakening Mauritians to the reality of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One family’s introduction to the New World society is interesting. A local publisher brought a man to the congregation meeting last February. He attended fairly regularly, so one of the missionaries visited his home in April and found he had a family of three children, all in their teens and all Catholic. That very day he volunteered to go out in the work from door to door. It was Sunday. The following Saturday he destroyed their image of Mary, five rosaries, religious pictures and all their religious trinkets. After the house cleaning he said to his family: “Don’t go to church tomorrow; come to the meeting with me and learn the truth.” The family all came and have been coming ever since. Four were baptized at the assembly in August and all started publishing that month, helping the congregation to reach an all-time peak the last month of the service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark301"></a>MADAGASCAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Madagascar is a very large French-colonial island off the east coast of Africa, where but little Kingdom work has been done. Following the Triumphant Kingdom assembly in Paris last year, two French special pioneers were sent to Tananarive, the capital, where a few days after their arrival they were visited by Brother M. G. Henschel and the branch servant of the newly formed Mauritius branch. The stage was set for theocratic expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The natives appear to be very humble, god-fearing and anxious to learn. With their liking for Bible text cards on the walls of their humble homes, we noted that these gave prominence to the name Jehovah. The widely circulated Malagasy Bible likewise uses the divine name freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After six months’ work the pioneers reported their first Madagascar publisher. Supported thereafter by the good example of a newly arrived married couple from France, local people increased their share in field activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The end of the year finds an eight-publisher group completing a congregation application form for the prospective Tananarive congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The French island of La Reunion is situated about one hundred miles from Mauritius and it was possible for one of the Gilead graduates to make two short visits. In Saint Denis, the capital, the people appeared very willing to learn and several have written to the branch office and to Paris since. We are looking forward to the day when it will be possible to send some</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">French pioneers to get the Kingdom work established there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark302"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The New World society in Mexico had many happy experiences as thousands of new publishers advanced in knowledge and grew to maturity during the past year. Certainly the tithes were brought into Jehovah’s storehouse and Jehovah opened up the windows of heaven and poured out a great blessing upon his people. There was a good increase in the average number of publishers in the field during 1956 and a wonderful distribution was made of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines in Spanish. There is still much to be done in all parts of this great nation, and Jehovah’s witnesses, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, will try to get it done. The branch servant gives us some interesting accounts of experiences that happened during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of our blessings was to help persons in the reading and writing classes, with the authorization of the government. In two months, January and February, a total of 2,793 publishers and persons of good will was enrolled in 191 classes. The reports on these classes sent to the branch by the circuit servants are very encouraging. One of these reports, after showing that ten men, nine women and fifteen children, a total of thirty-four, were enrolled, says: “All the students are grateful for this provision. By now (two months after the classes started) most of the students know how to spell and how to read diphthongs. The classes are conducted twice a week and if they continue as they have up to now all the students will know how to read and write in a short time, despite the fact that all were born and raised in this mountainous area.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The April 1 special issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> gave a tremendous witness in this country and was an effective instrument in finding persons of good will. A publisher reports that while he was working from house to house in his territory a person of good will who had read the April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> stopped him and asked him several questions. After his questions were satisfactorily answered he joined the publisher in the house-to-house work, obtaining one subscription that day. The same day a Bible study was started In his home. He was so impressed with the truth that he invited all his friends and relatives to hear a public talk that was to be delivered at his home on Sunday, May 27, after field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, not all work that is done is done without opposition. A circuit servant reports that while a little mining town was worked the president of the Catholic Action group in that town formed a mob and went to the school and stopped the classes and had the children join the mob, so that all together they could stone the publishers out of town. Some of the publishers had to run up a ravine for about a half hour’s time to escape the mob, while the other publishers obtained protection in the homes of persons of good will living in that town. This mobbing did not frighten these publishers. Later they called back on these people of good will in the town, studied with them and then helped them get started in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publishers are growing to maturity and appreciation of the organization and the provisions made by it. The circuit assemblies are playing an important part in this and the publishers know it. A group of publishers in the State of Sonora rode on horseback and others walked for eight days in order to attend their circuit assembly. At another circuit assembly a person of good will attended for the first time. On Sunday she was informed that one of her close relatives had died, so she had to go home; but remembering Jesus’ words: “Let the dead bury the dead,” she stayed home but a few minutes and returned to the assembly and did not miss a single part of the program. Last year the janitor of a hall where a circuit assembly was being held was present at all of the sessions of the circuit assembly and saw the film &quot;The New World Society in Action.” After the assembly the publishers called on him and studied with him and his wife. Both began to attend meetings and to take part in the field service and both attended the last circuit assembly, not as a janitor and his wife or as persons of good will, but as publishers. Both were immersed at the last assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark303"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The theocratic activity in the Netherlands during the year was very beneficial, as the brothers showed joy in giving Jehovah God exclusive devotion. By considering the shortcomings and the advances one can see where improvements can be made for the service year that lies ahead. The Netherlands had a very good start during the first three months, but then some setbacks were experienced during the winter because of heavy storms, and they were never able to regain their losses. So the end of the year shows a loss in the number of publishers during the 1956 service year. The brothers are not at all discouraged, but they will press on with greater zeal and determination to pick up the losses and to make gains. While they had a one-percent increase, this certainly does not compensate for all the newly baptized ones, who totaled 751 during the year. The branch office gives us some interesting experiences about the Netherlands and there is also a report on Dutch New Guinea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The many experiences sent in to this office show how the gathering of the other sheep has happened. The press has shown more and more interest in our activities and many have received a witness through this medium. Last fall the radio gave us an opportunity to give a good witness and many reports came in on how persons of good will responded. A sister tells how she had arranged for a call at the home of her married son, but when the two publishers arrived, the young wife, apparently embittered against everything religious, told the publishers she could do without what they had to tell her. Since that time this couple turned cool toward the witnesses. This went on for some time. In the meantime the couple had listened to the discussion on the radio and were impressed. Thereafter the mother noticed that the son and wife had changed in their attitude and even had many questions and soon a study was begun. They drank the water of truth as any thirsty soul would and are growing fast in the truth, the wife having even taken part in telling others of the blessings of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A zealous sister reports how she went out braving rainy weather to hand out invitations for a film showing. She handed a handbill to a woman who took it, read it and queried: “Is this from Jehovah’s witnesses?” “Indeed, madame.” “Then come on in,” the lady answered. “I am glad to have come in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. My husband and I have often looked out for you but no one ever came.” It soon appeared that they knew much about the witnesses. The husband was reluctant to take up contact as he felt one big obstacle stood in the way: he could not free himself from the tobacco habit. The sister assured him that for the time being that should be no hindrance and certainly not to his attending the film showing. Still they could not go on account of their small child, who could not be left alone. The sister promptly volunteered to baby-sit. This made a great impression on the newly interested couple. They attended the film showing, which proved to be a turning point in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Bible study was arranged for, and they began attending all meetings. Two months later they attended the circuit assembly and then on to the next circuit assembly, when they were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Acting on Brother Knorr’s counsel to move out into the smaller cities for the 1956 district assemblies we experienced many blessings. Two assemblies were held in the Netherlands in cities never before served by large assemblies. The witness given was tremendous. The attitude of the people and the press and radio changed visibly in these two cities. The authorities broke records in their helpfulness and co-operation, even though one of the cities was the center of Catholic education and action. At the writing of this report sixty new Bible studies have already been established as a result of the conventions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark304"></a>DUTCH NEW GUINEA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A member of the marines stationed in New Guinea has become very much interested in the truth. He has been corresponding with a brother in the Netherlands and shows a keen desire to continue growing in the truth, although his military obligations make it difficult for him from time to time. Among other things he writes: “As I see it, it is very urgent that here in New Guinea real witnesses of Jehovah must come to preach God’s Word. A great field of activity lies open here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brother in Manokwari reports that he now has two more Papuans who are willing to study the truth. The missions in New Guinea have apparently been keeping an eye on these activities, however small, and have been making it difficult for our brothers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark305"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark306"></a>NETHERLANDS ANTILLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">True to his word, Jehovah God has poured out a rich blessing upon his people in the Netherlands Antilles. There are three islands that come under the jurisdiction of the branch office located in Curacao and the names are Curacao, Aruba and Bonaire. Interesting experiences are related from each of these islands. Now that the magazines in Hollandish are coming out in a more attractive size and are more easily presented to the people in their homes and on the streets the brothers in these islands are having some unusual experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One missionary placed over 4,000 magazines for the year and one congregation publisher placed the unusual number of 106 magazines in one day. This did not happen during the April campaign with the special issue but in June, and the publisher was not trying to set a record. It just happened in the regular course of events. On a Saturday morning the publisher went from house to house with magazines and placed a goodly number. At noon she and a pioneer brother went to where a group of government workers were being paid for the week, and they both placed many magazines. Then about 4 p.m. the sister and her husband, who live about a mile from downtown, left home and, one on each side of the street, they slowly walked to town offering magazines to the people they met, and when they arrived in town an hour or so later they had both placed a great many magazines. This sister has since joined the pioneer ranks, and that is counted as another blessing for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One publisher, who has many children but whose husband is opposed and will not let them attend meetings, reads the daily text and comment from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> to the children every evening. One night a son of fifteen years of age was not at home when they considered the daily text for the day. When he got home and went to bed he said he could not go to sleep but could not imagine why. Then he remembered that he had not been there for the daily text, so he got up and read it by himself so he could go to sleep. This certainly shows the effect of habit on a person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year two special pioneers were sent out to the west end of the island to work some territory that was not being properly worked. So far they have found many people of good will and started many home Bible studies as well as meetings at a central location. When the circuit servant went to visit them he took along the film “The New World Society in Action.” A lady of good will who lives just across the street from the Catholic church at Barber gave us permission to show the film in her front yard, on a Thursday night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thursday p.m. the circuit servant and pioneers dropped in to see if everything was in order for the showing of the film that night and found the lady of good will a bit excited. She said the priest had just come over and tried to get her to cancel the showing of the film. She refused, they had a little spat, and the priest went over to the school and told all the children to tell their parents not to come to see the film, as it was forbidden by the church. The lady said it might be best to put off the showing for a couple of weeks to let things cool off. While they were discussing the matter, the chief of police, a tall Dutchman, came in and said he had just called Willemstad and they said they had no record that this film had ever been censored by the government so it could not be shown if that was true. He was shown that the film had been censored on May 16, 1954, and recommended for children as well as grownups. He said he could not stop it then, but said he would send extra policemen to keep order, suggesting there might be disorder. Now the lady of good will was more excited than ever, but at 7:30 that evening the show was put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chief of police (a Catholic) and other policemen were there. Over a hundred persons came to see the film and enjoyed it. When it was over the lady of good will was pleased that so many came to see it. The policemen said they enjoyed it too, and wanted to know when it would be shown again. The next day as we went from house to house the people said that when the children came home from school and told them the priest sent word for them not to see the film it just made them more eager to see it. The following Sunday sixty persons came to the home of the special pioneers to hear the public lecture; so we give thanks to Jehovah for another victory and another year of blessings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark307"></a>ARUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In February a new missionary home was opened in Oranjestad, Aruba. The home was purchased and renovated by a local brother and rented to the Society at a very low price. The new home is about one mile from the city and is located in the midst of Aruban natives, who are all very friendly and pleased to have the missionaries living among them. The film was shown at the missionary home and eighty people came to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The climax to the blessings and joys of the year came when a new publisher was brought into the truth in the following manner: A missionary doing street work met a young sailor from Spain, who had been left in Aruba by his boat to undergo an operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publisher writes: “He seemed so sincere I could not let him go without trying to help him further, so I took him to the home of a Spanish-speaking sister, where we answered his questions. He got other bound books and Bibles from me too. Sunday he came to meeting. Monday I was to answer more questions; he said there was so much he needed to know. The next day and almost every day until he left Aruba he came to the missionary home and studied with me from two to four hours. He came with us to the area study and took part, as the study is held from a Spanish book. On July 7 he saw the film ‘The Happiness of the New World Society’ and marveled at the efficiency of the New World society. The next morning he came in the service for the first time and joyfully spoke to the people at the doors. July 13 he expressed a desire to be baptized. July 14 he quit smoking. July 15 we studied the articles on Baptism and Dedication in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> After carefully reading several times the questions to be asked he looked up and said: ‘I can answer “yes.” ’ The congregation rejoiced when it was announced that he would be baptized the next day. It was as if I had a new baby! July 16 he was baptized and was so joyful about being able to call us ‘brothers’ that when he came up out of the water he gave a big smile and called out </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Saludos, hermanos’</span><span class="font3"> (Greetings, brothers). Since going back to sea he has started a study with another sailor and subscriptions have been obtained. His family, of whom one is a priest, write him that he has made a ‘blunder.’ If Jehovah permits he hopes to go back to Spain and preach there and show his family who is ‘blundering.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark308"></a>BONAIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It is encouraging to note how the truth is penetrating to every nook and corner of our territory. While in Bonaire the circuit servant obtained a new subscription from a man of good will who had recently come there to live from the Dutch island of Saba. There were no publishers in Saba then, but still this man was well acquainted with the witness work because of the Society’s boat’s visiting Saba. Also a new subscription was obtained from the Venezuelan Consul, who was new in Bonaire, too, but the literature was not new to him. He had been in contact with the witnesses in Venezuela before coming to Bonaire and was favorable to the work. Then there was the lady living in the country who had been in the hospital in Curacao and obtained the literature and brought it home with her. She too liked it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark309"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The happy God, Jehovah, has given his witnesses in Newfoundland every reason to be joyful. His organization has prospered. The windows of heaven were opened and great blessings have been showered upon all the faithful workers of the Kingdom. It is a delight to see the increase in publishers, back-calls and Bible studies as well as in magazines, hours in the field and more frequent visits of the circuit servant. All of this has contributed to the growth of the organization, to Jehovah’s honor. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences, which cause one to stop and consider the blessing of Jehovah, especially with regard to making back-calls on placements in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A congregation servant commenting on the growth of his congregation had this to say: “You know, Jehovah is indeed a wonderful God. He has proved this time and again in our little congregation. When we first started we had ten regular publishers and a number of irregular ones. Our problem was, How were we to overcome this weakness of irregularity? The Society suggested working rural territory during the summer months. We started with the offer and latest magazines. Within a short time we put out many bound books and more than 300 magazines. It was then stressed by the circuit servant that we go out every Sunday morning to do house-to-house work in the country, leaving the nearby territory for bad weather. Every Sunday, children, mothers and fathers, with lunch, leave for the territory. The results: we have put in hundreds of hours, and our congregation has increased from ten to twenty-one publishers with five new praisers of Jehovah. These new brothers are looking forward to symbolizing their dedication by water immersion and want to serve Jehovah for the duration of their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day while discussing the Bible in a hospital with a Roman Catholic, a brother was accused of having a Bible possessed with a devil. However, the brother quickly showed the man that it was the Catholic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font3"> he was using. This brought favorable comment from the patient in the next bed, who requested that he come over and study with him. The brother gladly did this all during his stay at the hospital. He also placed three bound books, two of these with a nurse, and nineteen magazines. Yes, this brother spent a very happy time in his confined territory assignment. Really those who choose to serve Jehovah are not cramped beyond movement in the most confined places on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The back-call and Bible study work deserves our fullest support. The more one engages in the Kingdom ministry the more one appreciates this. During World War II a young Russian girl came to be a prisoner of war and was carried off by the Gestapo to a concentration camp and made to perform forced labor. Her work was to complete bombs after the fuses had been inserted. She was only eighteen, but knew that these bombs would be killing many people—perhaps her own family—so she secretly took the fuses out of over 800 bombs. She was caught defusing the last eight and was sentenced to hang on May 10. However, on May 9 the American troops liberated the camp. Knowing several languages, she was used as an interpreter by the U.S. officials during the Nuremberg trials. After that she came to the United States and was married to a U.S. air force officer. It was in the United States that she obtained a copy of the first edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font3">However, she put it away and since the publisher who placed the book never did return to make a back-call her initial interest was allowed to die out. She then moved with her husband from base to base and although they could take a very limited number of books with them she always took along </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font3">It went to various places in the United States, then to Germany and back. They were assigned next to St. John’s, Newfoundland, and it was there she was invited to attend a Bible study conducted with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font3"> Seeing the book, she told the story of her book and she immediately arranged to attend the Bible study regularly. She is making good progress and is now doing a great deal of incidental preaching. She feels it must have been Jehovah who preserved her through those war years so that she could learn the truth. She wants all members of the New World society to remember her experience and make sure that they follow up all placements rather than make the people with whom they place literature wait about eight years before they make a back-call.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark310"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The ministers of the Kingdom in New Zealand have enjoyed the past year greatly. They have experienced very excellent increases, making their ten percent for the 1956 service year. All of them are looking to 1957 and “from day to day will tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> There is still much to be done in this large island in the Pacific. The northern island has received excellent coverage, but there is still much to be accomplished in the southern island. A number of very interesting experiences are related by the branch servant, as reported to the office by the ministers of the Kingdom in New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The visit of Brothers Knorr and Adams and the Auckland Triumphant Kingdom assembly were memorable events in the service year. The following are typical of the joyful follow-up experiences of Auckland publishers. One brother and sister obtained three Bible studies serving five newly interested persons. Two of these have now become regular publishers and the others are progressing well. Another said: ‘I have absolutely no faith in the Bible, but to obtain the joy I saw among Jehovah’s witnesses at Carlaw Park during the public talk I shall study the Bible and prove it for myself.’ Two former stanch religionists finally became nauseated at the confusion of the sects, so decided to attend Carlaw Park and hear Brother Knorr. They were enthralled at the logic of the talk and the happiness of the New World society. Negative results attended constant back-calling on a Maori lady. After hearing Brother Knorr she gained a yearning to be in the New World society. A study was arranged and she is now a new publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Learning of an interested lady living ten miles out of town, a pioneer sister found six homes in the locality. Not knowing the exact house to call on she decided to witness to them all. At the first house no one was home. At the next house the lady took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font3">and wanted a study. Then the interested person was located and proved interested indeed. She had had previous studies and told her neighbors about the truth. She asked the pioneer sister to be sure to call on the ‘not at home,’ which she eventually did and found a spiritually hungry ex-Catholic, who gladly took a book and some Bibles. Studies were arranged even though it meant a twenty-mile bicycle ride each week. In a month’s time they were attending the local </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">study and after the circuit servant’s visit two wanted to share in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Tongan man who is in New Zealand learning carpentry heard the truth at his place of employment. He attended the congregation meetings and a book study was arranged. He is the son of a chief and also is related to Queen Salote of Tonga. He returns to Tonga at the end of the year and hopes to teach the Pacific Islanders not only carpentry but also the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A publisher contacted a poor but interested Anglican woman, with whom he left a book and Bible free. Studies with her and a married daughter brought increasing appreciation of the truth. One study day the old lady was found trying to conduct a study with three Anglican visitors who did not appear to be very much interested. Then who next should happen along but the local Anglican parson, who had been writing some very derogatory articles about Jehovah’s witnesses! He began by insulting the study conductor and demanded of the old lady why she allowed such book-selling racketeers into her house. She replied that Jehovah’s witnesses were very welcome, were not racketeers, and produced her free literature to prove it. This threw the parson off balance and it was easy to trip him right up with Scriptural proof when he started on the soul and the subject of war. At this he lost control and rushed across the room at the witness, shouting, Tn the name of God I’ll smite thee,’ which, of course, was his complete undoing. Visitors as well as householder turned on him then, and he slunk away just as the beaten Pharisees did after contending with Jesus. Now the old lady, daughter and granddaughter have left the church and are witnessing regularly. The three visitors came from another town, but they have been called back on and are kindly disposed toward the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The son of one of the publishers met a young man at a football match and invited him home for a meal. Then he was invited to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study the next day and he enjoyed it so much that he attended the service meeting. Learning that he lived near her, a pioneer offered him a ride home. He joined the family for refreshments and stayed till midnight asking questions about our teachings. He had only recently arrived at this town and before meeting Jehovah’s witnesses had joined the Anglican Church, but no one ever spoke to him when he attended. He immediately felt the difference in the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. He continued attending the service meetings and got more questions answered at the pioneer’s home. Now he has become a publisher, and all the brothers feel rewarded for not neglecting to make the stranger welcome.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark311"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is one thing that was a great blessing to all the publishers in Nicaragua during the past year and that is the spiritual food that was received regularly through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> With the ever-increasing knowledge the brothers are brought on to mature understanding so that they get a clear and vivid picture of Jehovah’s purposes. Therefore they rejoice in distributing this good food to other people of good will. More attention has been given to their personal study and this has made the New World society in Nicaragua stronger. They had a fine increase during the year, reaching an all-time peak. The brothers fully appreciate that if a Christian is spiritually sick he will become infirm and be of very little value to those who are blinded by Satan and in need of help. In order to bring others out of darkness so that they can walk in the way of truth they must keep up with the light from God’s Word. The branch servant gives some very interesting experiences and some are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of our most outstanding increases this year was the placement of individual magazines. A goodly number of missionaries and publishers have really become magazine-conscious, thus showing their own appreciation for them. A new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> subscriber took the special April 1 issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> After reading it, and noting especially how Jehovah’s Christian witnesses are suffering in Russian slave labor camps, she realized that house-to-house preaching is a necessary part of following in Jesus’ footsteps. When a return call was made she inquired if the missionary would train her to preach from door to door just the way she did. So, publishers, make back-calls on your magazine placements!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This same missionary often travels to her territory by the city bus. Being magazine-conscious, she has learned to place them effectively with fellow passengers. Oftentimes, later, the people will call to her and ask if she has the latest numbers, and some have become a part of her magazine route. In the store-to-store work, when a businessman was offered “sample copies </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font3"> the latest” magazines, he replied: “Six weeks ago I got some samples, do I have to wait another six weeks now to get some more?” Of course not, he could subscribe and get every issue; now he does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many humorous experiences help to make the time pass rapidly too while one is engaged in magazine work. A man, offered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> refused it. His reason? He told the publisher: “It refers to so many other books, Genesis, Isaiah, Romans. I don’t have all those books in my library.” He was very happy to learn that he did have them all, right in his own Bible, and happy to take the magazine to learn more about the meaning of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The film “The New World Society in Action” continues to be a blessing. Arrangements were made to show it in the house of an isolated publisher who lives about one kilometer from the village. After the film was thoroughly advertised in the village, so many persons came to see it that halfway through the first reel we had to announce that we would show it again that night and therefore they should not try to push into the house, as there was no more room. For the first showing 180 persons saw it; ninety the second time, though it was quite late at night for them. A person of good will seeing this picture and paying attention to all it presents should be determined to want to learn more and to be one of these happy worshipers of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark312"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The New World society in Nigeria shows up as a fine organization. More circuit servants are on the road and are visiting the congregations, getting to them at least three times a year and stressing the training program. Not only is it necessary to carry on a training program and show people how to preach from house to house, but in many instances it is a matter of training them to read and write. What a joy it is for persons who have learned to read to be able to turn to their own </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> which will enable them to increase their understanding, and take in the spiritual food from Jehovah’s bountiful table. This, of course, brings them more in line with Jehovah’s good purposes. All are certainly thankful to Jehovah for the blessings of the past year and with joy look forward with renewed zeal to another full year of Kingdom service. The experiences in Nigeria have been very interesting and the branch servant reports not only on this country, but on Dahomey also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service year started on a high note with great activity in preparation for the visit of Brother Henschel in November. The two four-day assemblies held produced a combined attendance at the public meetings of almost 34,000. Thousands of hours were spent in clearing the assembly grounds and building the booths. All of this voluntary work by hundreds of brothers was a great witness in itself and resulted in many of the townspeople’s joining in and working happily alongside us. Many stayed for the assembly sessions and are still with us now, as publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The circuit assemblies too, with their fine practical demonstrations of how to accomplish our ministry, have been stimulating to publishers and good-will persons alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of the assembly the local church catechist said: “Our church has strayed. We are covetous and have no love and when we pray God does not answer us. Jehovah’s witnesses are kind to all men. Their love is shown by their preaching in our homes. Because of this God blesses them and answers their prayers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year many brothers have left the pioneer ranks. No doubt the cares of the world weigh heavily and it needs strong faith to stick to the pioneer service. But the blessings and joys that come to faithful pioneers far outweigh the difficulties, as shown by this experience of one who joined the pioneer ranks this year. “At the beginning of my pioneer service I started to witness in a nearby village that I had always regarded as a village of goats. I prepared a sermon on a Bible topic and started work. Very soon I had obtained a subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> in Yoruba and had placed seven individual copies, and the people were asking me many questions. After a short time I made a return call and placed three copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’. I</span><span class="font3"> arranged studies with them and soon fourteen people were attending. Three of these are now regularly attending the congregation meetings. These experiences have made me very happy, for I know that Jehovah is blessing my pioneer service. I realize now that when one is a pioneer it is much easier for him to gain the lost sheep. Those who were once goats to me are now sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To go out to an isolated assignment without knowing anyone there and without even knowing where you will sleep that night requires real faith. A special pioneer in such a position reports as follows: “That Jehovah is true to his promise to shower his blessings upon his faithful servants is shown right from the beginning of my journey to Nembe. I gave a tract to a man sitting opposite me in the river boat, which eventually resulted in my giving him a witness. He became interested and on arrival at Nembe was glad to hear that I intended to stay there. He kindly offered me a house in his father's compound and I have now started a home Bible study with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A situation calling for great tact and ingenuity arose in a town to which a special pioneer was assigned and in which there was a very strong Catholic element. The people of a certain compound chased him out with sticks when he tried to witness there. The question arose, how to give the witness? Having noticed that one of the men in the compound was a tailor the pioneer returned with a length of cloth in his bag and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font3"> in his pocket. When he entered the people began to ask each other: “Is this not the man we chased away for preaching false doctrines to us?” The pioneer replied that this time he had come not to preach but to have the tailor sew some cloth for him. So as the tailor did the work the pioneer sat down and began to read aloud, as if to himself, from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font3"> on the subject of the trinity. Soon the tailor was listening and could not refrain from asking questions. The result is that he is now having a Bible study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark313"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">“When a man’s ways please Jehovah, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.” (Prov. 16:7, AS) In the small French West African colony of Dahomey the brothers have had good cause this year to experience the truth of this scripture. For several years past they have worked under difficult conditions. The Society’s literature is banned and from time to time many of the brothers have been arrested at the instigation of the priests. Every effort has been made to discourage them and scare them out of the service. But through it all the brothers have grown stronger in faith and the preaching work has made fine progress. During the last service year Jehovah has truly ‘opened the windows of heaven and poured out a blessing.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Occasional outbursts of opposition still occur here and there. Early in the year the circuit servant was arrested and sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, but instead of being taken away to jail he was released and told that they would come for him when they were ready. So far they have not collected him and he is still working in his circuit. His efforts have been greatly blessed and, as the year drew to a close, it was necessary for us to organize a second circuit in Dahomey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even those special pioneers who have only been on their assignments for a few months are having good results. In the last half of the service year five groups of publishers have sprung up in five different assignments. In April one special pioneer was sent to a place where interested people had been found during unassigned territory work by congregation publishers who had difficulty in going back to feed the sheep. In May, seven new publishers were out in the field. In June this had increased to twelve and in July to twenty-four. Now the special pioneer has the joyful prospect of feeding these young lambs and bringing them on to maturity. What a happy life is that of the pioneer!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark314"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The branch office in Northern Rhodesia looks after much territory in Central Africa, such as Northern Rhodesia itself, Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. Some very fine experiences have been enjoyed by Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of the world during the past year. They are very grateful to Jehovah God for the new equipment in the way of the publication of books, booklets and magazines in different languages. All of this has helped Jehovah’s witnesses to reach the people of good will and to bring them on to maturity and to show them the importance of taking a stand for Jehovah God and preaching his kingdom. Good increases have been enjoyed in each of the countries in the way of regular publishers engaging in the field service, but one must always realize that those in positions of responsibility acting as overseers can never relax. They must diligently seek to serve those that are in their charge. Jesus said: “Feed my sheep” and he meant not only for Peter to do that, but all of his servants throughout the earth, especially the overseers. So there continues to be much to do, not only in Africa, but in all parts of the world. Excerpts from the report of the branch servant follow and will be of interest to all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The service year got off to the best of starts with our Triumphant Kingdom assembly held outside Kitwe with a record-breaking 36,000 in attendance. It was at this assembly that Brother Henschel released to an excited audience the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom” </span><span class="font3">in Cinyanja and Cibemba, a booklet which was to have the largest circulation of any of the Society’s publications in Northern Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font3"> has played a prominent part in the ministry. One of the missionaries working among Europeans reports that she starts every study with this booklet, and then follows through with a bound-book study. This has proved very successful, for after only four months working in her new assignment nine people of good will attended the public meeting during the circuit servant’s visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been equally effective in the African field. A publisher called on a man who was worshiping the spirit of his dead mother. After discussing the paragraphs in the booklet dealing with the soul he said: “I will no more worship the spirits.” A Bible study was started with him, and now he is planning to visit his elder brother, who is a chief, to help him stop worshiping the dead mother’s spirit, because now he knows that she is unconscious in death and that his former worship was foolish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following experience reminds us that even back issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> can be used with powerful effect in helping people on the way to life. A police detective inquiring into the activities of one of the African congregations had a long discussion with the congregation servant. After answering a number of objections, the brother was asked: “Why and how do you get more attendance at your meetings?” To illustrate his reply the publisher took from his bookshelf the August 1, 1953, copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> containing the article “Gathering Men of All Nations into One Flock.” The brother reported: “As I read to him and commented on some of the paragraphs he grinned with delight. How it suited the occasion! Finally, he asked for copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and expressed his wish to subscribe. He invited me to visit him at his house, where upon my arrival a lunch was provided by his wife. He asked me to pray, and then during the meal </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">continued to discuss the truth with him. He was full of joy. A regular Bible study has been started. His wife is already a regular attendant at the congregation meetings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One isolated publisher was contacted by the district servant, and in one day the two of them spent eleven hours in the service, placing six subscriptions and two New World Translation Bibles, as well as other literature, with good-will persons to whom the isolated publisher had done some preaching. This good-will person was a “colored” (Euro-African) with a large family, and their conduct showed that they were being brought up with good Christian discipline. Each child had been trained to recite parts of the Bible. The little boy, aged six, could recite the whole of the twenty-third Psalm from the American Standard Version Bible, and the other children likewise were learning parts of the Scriptures. The visit of the district servant gave them much encouragement, and this publisher and a number of his good will attended the local African circuit assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark315"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There is no doubt that during the past year the work has come in for more attention than ever before, particularly from the standpoint of government officials and the press. Back in November, Brother Henschel made a direct approach to the government of the Belgian Congo in Leopoldville, and at that time presented a petition for the removal of the ban against the Society and Jehovah’s witnesses. This initial approach was followed by a further visit to Leopoldville and then by representations in New York and Brussels. Later a specialist on African affairs from Belgium visited the Northern Rhodesian branch office, and an opportunity was afforded to give a detailed explanation of our work and our message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When it became known that consideration was being given to recognizing the Society, it produced a flood of newspaper articles. It is evident from reading the newspaper reports that much confusion still exists in the Belgian Congo as to the true nature of our Christian ministry, and in the minds of many the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is wrongly associated with certain native sects. However, little by little, knowledge of our work in other countries is having its effect. For example, one newspaper asked the question: “Why is it that the Watchtower organization is banned In the Congo, whereas it is openly active in the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, both British?” The article further stated: “The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kitawala</span><span class="font3"> [this name is used in the Congo to refer to the Watch Tower Society] adepts are the elite, the cream of the native population. They are unshakable in their convictions, their conduct is exemplary; they practice a sort of Puritanism which they seek to impose on others. They do not smoke, drink or commit adultery. Their way of living commands respect, and they enjoy an exceptionally good reputation.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Le Peuple,</span><span class="font3"> April 12, 1956)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The newspaper </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Courrier d’Afrique</span><span class="font3"> of April 24, 1956, makes some similar comments, referring to a report made by M. Joset, the Belgian expert mentioned above, who visited the Northern Rhodesian branch office. The paper says that M. Joset “expresses the opinion that the Kitawala is only dangerous in the eyes of missionaries desirous of combating a doctrine opposed to Catholicism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unfortunately the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kitawala</span><span class="font3"> is used in the Congo to refer both to the Watch Tower Society and to an indigenous African movement, the beliefs and practices of which have nothing in common with Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watch Tower Society. The Congo has nothing to fear from Jehovah’s witnesses and the Watch Tower Society, as the results of their Christian activity in neighboring African countries amply demonstrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, the ban continues and the brothers in the Belgian Congo have to work under much difficulty. Two hundred and sixteen attended the Memorial celebration, though meeting in small groups.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark316"></a>KENYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the year two mature publishers, a married couple, moved into the territory, and this was a great encouragement to the few publishers in the country. Having a brother to take the oversight of the congregation and conduct the meetings has been most beneficial to the spiritual growth of the brothers. The wife has now taken up pioneer work, and this means that more and more people will be reached with this good news of the Kingdom. The congregation servant in Nairobi writes: “This year has been a source of encouragement to the brothers in Kenya. For several years the bulk of the activity has been carried on by two sisters who have done fine work in sowing much seed. Now the ministerial activity has been better organized, and the 20-percent increase in publishers was exceeded in April, and new peaks in hours, back-calls and studies were reached. For the past three months our one pioneer has been conducting seven regular studies. This gives us prospects for a good increase in the coming year, and we look forward confidently to Jehovah’s blessing as we work to that end.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark317"></a>TANGANYIKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This past service year has seen continued steady progress in Tanganyika. Brothers who took up special pioneering during the year have done good work sowing seed, and we look forward in the year ahead to that seed’s producing fruitage of increased praisers to Jehovah. This has not been without opposition. One pioneer reported that a priest of a Roman Catholic mission told a village headman to chase away from his village a man who had recently accepted the truth and begun publishing. This new brother explained the matter to the special pioneer. The pioneer went with the brother to the mission and talked to the priests there, and showed that they had no authority to chase anybody from his home, to which they agreed. Thereafter a Bible discussion developed on trinity, the worship of Mary, the soul and the end of the world. A number of people gathered to listen to the discussion and beheld the priests desperately searching in their books for some answer to the Scriptural presentation. After a discussion that lasted three and a half hours the priests accepted four booklets from the pioneer, and the people standing by commented: “Jehovah’s witnesses have God’s power; they now preach even to the priests.” One priest said to the pioneer: “Bring us more new books. May God bless you that you may progress in this vicinity.” This pioneer was so overjoyed with his experience that he put off his vacation because, as he said: “How good is this work of proclaiming the name of Jehovah!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without doubt the outstanding event in Tanganyika during the service year was the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action” in July at a circuit assembly. The district servant reported: “At the close of the film the air was filled with the cries of the crowd, saying, ‘Ndaka, ndaka’ (‘Thank you, thank you’).”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark318"></a>UGANDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">There has been a fine increase in Uganda, both among Europeans and Africans. A young African brother had to give up advanced schooling because he could not afford the school fees. He found a job fourteen miles out of town and promptly put into use the knowledge he had learned about Jehovah’s New World. He requested a mature brother to come out to talk to the group of interested persons he had witnessed to. What a pleasant surprise it was for this brother to find ten people waiting for him. On the next visit this had increased to fourteen. This has resulted in a regular study being conducted with the group twice a week, with an average attendance of nine. During the year the first-ever New World society baptismal service for Uganda was held, and three African brothers symbolized their dedication by being immersed in Lake Victoria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One brother, who has to make long safaris in connection with his secular work, makes use of his opportunities to preach in these isolated territories. At one place where he spent two days, five bound books, six booklets and five magazines were placed and three subscriptions obtained.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark319"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Though sincere efforts have been applied to all features of the Kingdom work in Norway by the majority of the brothers the results cry out for a greater effort in the service year ahead. Sometimes there is a slowing down, and we wonder why. Last year Norway had a nine-percent increase but this year there was a drop to a one-percent increase. Jehovah’s witnesses all over the world have given consideration to the shortcomings of the congregations. This includes the circuit and district servants and the admonition given by mature brothers at the assemblies. Although there is no decrease in the number of average publishers, rather an increase, it disturbs Jehovah’s witnesses when there is a slowing down of the coming in of the other sheep. All in the New World society are aware of the responsibilities that fall upon us, and we prayerfully seek Jehovah’s guidance and look with diligence to the work ahead. While 185 were baptized during the year, there was not that much of an increase on the average over last year and Norway did not reach its former peak. Jehovah’s witnesses are always willing to face the facts. Where are those that used to be with us? What are we doing to bring them on to maturity? While this is a problem for the overseers and a responsibility that they must meet, still the publishers are likewise concerned. However, many publishers continued with their good work in Norway and there are some fine experiences reported on by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pioneer writes the following experience from his work in isolated territory this summer. He pioneered, together with his wife, his mother and younger sister, who were vacation pioneers. “A lady had heard of the truth from a friend in America. She had thought much about the truth she had heard and had also tried to make contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. But as there were none around her home she failed to find them. Imagine, if you can, her great joy when we found her in our door-to-door witnessing. She gave us food and could not find words nor deeds enough to express her happiness. When we left her she said: ‘You must not go by a single house around here until you have talked to the people of Jehovah’s kingdom. I have witnessed to them many times but they won’t listen to me.’ She does not live too far from where we live so we hope to be able to help her become stronger and more mature as a witness of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A congregation publisher doing some carpentry work in the basement of a Baptist church heard music and singing but nothing more above him. After a time one of the members came down the cellar steps and asked if he would not join them at lunch. He accepted and was told that the minister had failed to come and had not given notice of this. The brother expressed himself sympathetically and asked if he could not talk to them instead of their pastor. They were taken aback by this offer from a carpenter, but a friendly voice said: “You are welcome to do so.” The brother was given permission to use the altar Bible and gave a half-hour talk, starting with the scripture at John 17:3 and then going on to explain the work and purpose of Jesus’ coming to the earth, why he died, his resurrection, his preaching about the kingdom of heaven, what this kingdom is, how it works, how many members, the other sheep, explained how Christians must follow in Jesus’ footsteps and that meeting attendance was not enough. He supported all points made with scriptures. He concluded his talk by thanking them for remembering him working in the cellar. The forty persons in attendance expressed their thanks for what he had said and said that they had never heard anyone use so many scriptures as he had. By theocratic tact and taking advantage of every opportunity a good witness can often be given, as in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A special pioneer sister writes telling how she got a home Bible study started. “I was waiting along the road for a sister who was with me from house to house. As I stood there I was watched by a woman in a nearby house. She came out and called to me: ‘Have you thought to pass by my house?’ Oh no, I also wish to talk to you, said I. ‘Well, hurry and come in then, as it is much too cold out there.’ I was given a cup of coffee while we talked. Her interest in the truth had been aroused while she was visiting at another home when I called. The other household members did not show interest, but this visiting lady did. It is my hope that through our study she will gain enough knowledge to stand against the efforts of others to destroy her interest in the truth. She says: ‘When it says so-and-so in the Bible it has to be true.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This sister concludes her letter to the Society with: “So is the life of a pioneer, every day fresh as an unwritten page that all too soon is worn out if it were to hold all the experiences of Jehovah’s blessings on his work at this time.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark320"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Many changes are being made in this country; better wages are being paid, higher market prices are being obtained tor local products and this has brought about a more materialistic-minded people. So it is not only in America and Europe, but in many other parts of the world that materialism is affecting sober thinking. The brothers in Nyasaland are very thankful for the timely articles on materialism that have appeared in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. While there has been a decrease in the number of publishers, still there is genuine interest on the part of the people in the work, for 905 have been baptized. A responsibility now falls upon those who are overseers to see that these are brought on to maturity and that they hold their position within the New World society, so as to gain life in the New World. The branch at Blantyre, Nyasaland, looks after the work in that country and also helps the brothers in Portuguese East Africa as much as possible and gets the reports from them, although the work is forbidden in that land. When our African brothers once come into the truth they are determined to preach; even torture does not stop them. Below are some excerpts from the annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A circuit servant tells how, as they were building their grass booths in preparation for a circuit assembly, many people of good will voluntarily gave their aid in helping them while others brought in gifts of food, baskets filled with maize flour and chickens and even a sheep. The chief, later on, after listening to a talk on the new world, addressed his people, saying: “Look at Jehovah’s witnesses. They’re neatly dressed, clean in body and in speech. They are also a happy people and have something good to offer us and a future to look forward to, which they are offering us to share. Now look at ourselves: We are a dirty people, loving to sit round our beer pots, to drink, to smoke, to lie and to cheat and assault one another. It would be better if we were to follow the example that Jehovah’s witnesses are setting us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At a congregation the brothers started arranging for public meetings in the evening with such good results that the church elders and leaders arranged a “concert” to keep their flock away from Jehovah’s witnesses. It turned out that the “concert” was nothing else than “devil-dancing,” which won for the church leaders some rough handling by their followers and their dispersal to attend the public meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses. Among the elders was one of good will who later on invited the brothers to hold a Bible study in his home, the outcome of which was three new publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For many years the Nyasalander has looked upon Jehovah’s witnesses here as being just a local organization. But now with the entry of more and more Gilead-trained missionaries the folk here are beginning to sit up and take notice that this is an organization embracing many nations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark321"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark322"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While officialdom continues to look with disfavor upon the New World society and seeks to prevent the spread of its good message there are many hungry minds absorbing the life-giving waters of truth. Five brothers who were deported to San Tome island some years ago were active there building up a congregation of over twenty preachers before leaving them to return to their homes in this year of 1956. In San Tome they were allowed to preach unhindered, but when they arrived back in their home area they were called up by the local European district officer and told that they were to stop all preaching activities in their villages and in all surrounding areas. If they were to continue they would be deported, never to return again to their families. The brothers tried reasoning with him but without success. When he saw that he could not move them by threats he ordered that the brother who acted as spokesman be given a dozen cuts over the hand, and then let them return to their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On their arriving at their village and when the news got around that these brothers had returned, many people came in to see them to make sure that it was not just rumor, for when they were deported the local Roman Catholic priest had boasted that they would never return and, too, that they would stop preaching. Now for these brothers to return and for them to resume their preaching work amazed the people and has stimulated anew the interest of those who had previous acquaintance with them. The people acknowledge that Jehovah’s witnesses have something that they have not got and they will never forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An interested friend who was a schoolteacher in the heart of this large country received from a friend a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font3"> in Portuguese. Upon reading it he wrote to Brooklyn, and his letter was forwarded on to this branch. After the branch got in touch with him, he soon had more of the Society’s publications to study and before long, assisted by further counsel through correspondence, he was out in the field with additional supplies of literature, preaching to the people. In a short period of time seventeen others joined him, but he felt the need for more instruction in the service; so he gave up his schoolteaching job, collected whatever money he could and started off on his journey to Blantyre, Nyasaland. His money ran out on the way, so he found employment for a month and then used the money to complete his journey. He is now in employment again and learning the Cinyanja language, so that he can join intelligently in all the congregational studies and meetings with his Cinyanja-speaking brothers, to get an understanding of proper organization of the work and then return to his home to get things running theocratically there. It is quite possible that he will be able to do much work before anyone gets around to hindering his efforts to feed the Lord’s “other sheep.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark323"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses in Pakistan have a difficult time showing the people that the Bible contains the message of life. The Mohammedans feel they have the complete, the perfect religion; so why should missionaries bring them a Bible? Not only do the seasoned theocratic warriors have to be able to handle the arguments of the Moslems, but they must be able to stand up against false religion in the form of Christendom through its higher critics, who have joined forces with the Moslems in erecting a monument of disbelief in the Bible’s authenticity. Onward go the witnesses, ministers of the New World society, talking to everyone, those lofty in mind and those lowly of heart. The branch servant of Pakistan gives us some very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Scoffing at the idea of reasoning on religion a professor of philosophy said: “Since the Bible contains many illogical ideas that conflict with proved science, it means that we have just to take many of the things in religion for granted.” Illustrating this philosophy was the Bible’s mention of the rabbit’s chewing the cud. “This, of course, is simply ridiculous,” he stated. The witness countered by mentioning that true science did support the Bible in this case. The sarcastic rejoinder was to the effect that the witnesses must have their own kind of science. Later a return visit was made with the appropriate copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> which contained the report of the Smithsonian Institution. On the third visit the witness was amazed at the complete change of attitude of the professor as he meekly listened to further archaeological evidence that indisputably established the verity of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the “Christian” continues to oppose, often the Moslem shows a commendable desire to help. One of such instances was in connection with our search for a projector to show our film. A missionary contacted the proprietor of a big store, who, upon learning of his need, arranged not only for the necessary projector but for the audience as well. He said that he would be attending a meeting at his club that very night, so could invite the other members along with their guests. Result: The missionary had to be their special guest at dinner first, after which he gave a talk on the work and organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. The showing of the film followed to a very appreciative audience, which, incidentally, included many of the educated people of the town. Normally these folk would have been difficult to contact by other means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The simple but lucid explanation of our surpassing hope as presented through the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font3"> has been the medium for starting over 60 percent of the studies of two of the Gilead graduates. One of them was begun with an educated Moslem lady, where she learned for the first time the reason for sin and death, and also about the wondrous hope of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vigorous activity of two Watch Tower missionaries in a town where there was a long-established Protestant institution was enough to arouse the false shepherds from their spiritual torpor, temporarily, anyway. In their frantic endeavor to arrest the escape of some who were becoming interested in the Kingdom message, they actually engaged in house-to-house work. Was this to preach the good news? No. It was to spread the lie that the witnesses deny the sonship of Jesus Christ. Therefore, they said, the counsel at 2 John 4, 7-11 was to be applied in their case. Some of the persons contacted were intimidated, but one person of good will replied: “Your church is strong and well established; so why are you afraid of only two missionaries who have only just arrived in town to teach the Bible? Previously you had not bothered about us, so why visit us now? I for one am glad these witnesses have come, because, if nothing else, it has made you see the need of visiting us to teach the Bible. If you were </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font3"> missionaries you would continue to visit us regularly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To save face that is just what they had to do, that is, until the hot weather came and provided these pseudo-ministers with the “excuse” necessary for them to make their escape to the cooler clime of the hills. With perceptive powers sharpened, this sheeplike person is now regular in his association and study with the ‘true ministers of our God.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark324"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The good news of the Kingdom is being preached day by day in Panama and in the Canal Zone. Another very happy year has gone by wherein Jehovah’s witnesses were able to give out the fragrance of the knowledge of God, which is perceptible in every place throughout the country, even in the remote sections of the land. A new all-time peak was reached in this Central American country when a total of 1,039 engaged in the ministerial service during April, 1956. They have had wonderful success in the distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> both in the English and Spanish languages. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of new fields opening up and some of them are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of special interest has been a large section of the country that borders on Colombia and that is inhabited to a large degree by Indians, being accessible only by boat. Early in the year effort was made to get the Kingdom message planted there when two pioneers were assigned to the capital of the province. Results were far better and quicker than had been anticipated as the people began to investigate “this new religion” that had arrived, and the branch office received repeated orders for more Bibles, more magazines and more Bible literature. The interest was such that after some weeks there, one of the pioneers wrote in saying that she could not adequately care for all the people of good will who wished to study the Bible with her. The circuit servant, after visiting them, said in his report to the Society that in some territories there just about everyone wanted to study the Bible and that as the pioneer minister would leave one house after a study, several would follow to the next place for the next study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After just a few months of preaching activity, some began to share with the pioneers in publishing the good news to others and as the year ended the report from there showed that twelve publishers were being trained in Kingdom ministry. It is hoped that shortly more villages in this region can be reached and preached to as the great gathering for survival continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers have played a good part in opening up new territories to the Kingdom message. Since the first part of the year many have used their vacation time for the pioneer service with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two signed up for the vacation pioneer service to go out to help a weak congregation for a month. By their arranging to see that all the irregular publishers were aided to participate in field service the report for the congregation for the month showed not the usual nine to twelve, but practically doubled to twenty-three, and the congregation has continued stronger ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fight for clean worship goes on and it is heartwarming to see the efforts put forth by the people of good will to put their marital affairs in order when they learn the truth. While visiting one congregation the circuit servant was asked to perform the marriage ceremony for four couples. These all had children; one couple had seven. They had never been taught the need of legalizing their marriage until they began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. At another congregation a couple had studied with the witnesses, but owing to the fact that the man had not left the village in about two years, it seemed doubtful that he would get out to the judge to get the marriage license, in order to get legally married. He could not bring himself to pass the dance hall where his son had been stabbed to death, and as a public expression of mourning had remained at home all this time. Nevertheless, the truth of God’s Word is powerful enough to make one break away from all traditions that may hinder him from keeping up with the true worship, and it proved to be so in this case when the circuit servant went with him to get the license. After the marriage the couple were baptized in symbol of their dedication and are now preaching the good news with the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark325"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Very good work was done in the inland country of Paraguay during the past year. The service centers have been better organized, the ministers saw to it that they came together and studied and kept busy in the preaching activity. The publishers have gone ahead and applied the instructions given through the service centers and immediate results were obtained. There was much more regularity in the field service, placements were up, particularly the magazine distribution, and all in Paraguay rejoice at the progress that was made. There are some very interesting experiences given by the branch servant that you will enjoy reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because of the poor mail service in the capital and other cities, many magazine subscribers were not getting their magazines regularly, and many did not get them at all, so other means of delivery had to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now the magazines all come to the congregation, territories have been divided into zones, and the publishers themselves deliver all subscribers’ magazines. Though much time is required in delivering them results have been shown by diligent delivery. One subscriber said: “How do you find time to deliver so many magazines and get nothing for it?” “We do get something for it,” explained the publisher, “we get life in the New World if we’re diligent to help the subscribers get their magazines, and then help them to understand the information in them. Besides, it gives us happiness to know that the subscribers are happy to get each copy of their magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enthused with the isolated-territory spirit, a group of forty-five publishers from the capital congregation invaded a small river town to the south, some two-and-a-half hours away by boat. All enjoyed the companionship in the boat and eyebrows raised in the town as enthusiastic “locusts” came ashore in eager groups calling on all in the town with the Kingdom hope and an invitation to a discourse in the municipal building in the town square. This is the first government-owned building we have been able to use. Net results were the placing of much literature and a surprised little town spiritually uplifted and still talking of the invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The film “The New World Society in Action” was shown in the interior with good results, except in the town of Yuty. Permission was given by the chief of police to show the film there after our first showing it in another town some twenty miles away. The equipment loaned by the North American Embassy was loaded in an oxcart and headed for the village. On the way the circuit servant, who was on horseback ahead of the equipment, was attacked by five masked men. One was shooting over his head with a revolver, two were brandishing long knives, and the other two had long whips lashing from all sides, all screaming: “We’re going to kill you!” The brother was taken into the woods, robbed of his wrist watch and billfold, then accused of being a Communist. He was told to go back to town and never come in that section again. While the film was being shown that night, as was scheduled, the same group, this time with fifty or more men, attacked the brothers. The film was immediately stopped and all went into the house just as the attackers began firing pistols from all sides of the yard. After shooting pistols for fifteen minutes, they threw stones for another two hours. Some entered the yard and took the movie screen, but by maneuvering in the darkness one brother, who was in the Chaco war with Bolivia, kept them from entering the house. They shouted that they had a “great god” and their god wanted blood, the blood of the two North American gringos. All who came to see the picture remained in the house all night. The next morning all the brothers’ horses were gone, and only by the help of the chief of police and a soldier from another town who heard about it were they able to escape further difficulties. Every indication showed that the police chief and the priest from Yuty were responsible for the trouble. Up until now the police and Ministry of Interior have done nothing about it and violence and persecution against the brothers in that part continue.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark326"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The ministers of the New World society in Peru have once again come to the end of another joyful year of service. To them it seems as though it passed as a flash, because it was so packed full of happy experiences in the Kingdom service. In this country, as in all the earth, the personal experiences that one has in the field cause time to pass by fleetingly, and time does not hang heavy for Jehovah’s witnesses. There was a fine increase in the gathering together of the other sheep. This brings great joy to all in Peru. A number of new missionary homes were opened and very good results have been seen in the new localities. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences and some are published for us here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is truly remarkable how persons suddenly awake to the truth. One case reported tells us the following: A witness had been calling on a lady who showed interest in the message, but the lady’s husband could not see anything in it. He used to argue with the witness, trying to prove that the witness was wrong, and this went on for a period of time. One day the husband met one of the brothers in the street, and he appeared very agitated, asking the brother to spend some time with him talking over the Kingdom message. It appears that the man had been turning things over in his mind, and while engaged in his business among other men who could be counted as intelligent men of high standing in the world, he had been struck with the contrast in what they were endeavoring to accomplish and the plain statements in the Bible about God’s New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He thought to himself: “My, where will all these people be when Armageddon comes?” and, naturally, this started him thinking of his own condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As he is of a somewhat nervous temperament, the prospects almost bowled him over. He earnestly sought the brother’s help, and having gone on studying the Word of God, both he and his wife are determined to stay with the New World society. They are awaiting the next assembly to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A case came up recently in Lima that shows how rapidly a person can advance to maturity if he applies himself diligently to God’s Word. One of the publishers contacted a doctor, who showed great humbleness in accepting implicitly what the Bible says. He started coming to the meetings in the Kingdom Hall, and in a short time was participating with the congregation in the field activity. About a month ago a sister in another congregation was hospitalized, pending an operation, and the doctors in the hospital were insisting that she have a blood transfusion. Finally it was mentioned to the new brother, to see if he could offer any advice as to procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now it so happens that this brother is a pathologist, specializing in the blood. He went to the hospital to speak to the doctor in charge of the case (whose assistant was originally trained in pathology by the brother), pointing out that the sister was not just a “crank” and telling him exactly what the Bible says about the sanctity of the blood. He discussed other methods of treating the patient, and up to the present the sister is responding well to the building-up treatment without the use of a blood transfusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The assemblies still provide a wonderful opportunity for new ones to make contact with the Lord’s organization, and many receive a spiritual impulse that starts them off on a course of serving God. At one recent assembly held about 600 miles to the south of Lima only sixty-five brothers could attend. But the attendance on the Sunday afternoon was 127, and 206 attended the exhibition of the film. Some new ones attended this assembly, their first assembly, and their very attendance showed the love that they have for Jehovah. They did not live in the town, nor in the nearby locality, but they had to travel on horseback for two days, then taking bus rides for two days more, in order to reach the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They got the truth in their village when a person of good will carried some publications there. Several got interested, and it was arranged for the circuit servant to visit them now and again. They eventually dedicated their lives to Jehovah, and in spite of all the opposition that they have received from Satan’s ‘birds’ they have kept firm for the truth. At one time two of the brothers were accused of robbing the image of the virgin, and the priest had them put in prison, but they were released a few days later.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark327"></a>PHILIPPINES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is with real gratitude to Jehovah God that those of the New World society in the Philippine Islands express their thankfulness for the privileges they have enjoyed during 1956. A mighty witness was given in the Philippines again. More hours were devoted to the field service. There was a greater distribution of magazines, though there were fewer publishers in the field and the back-call and Bible study fields dropped under last year’s figures. The brothers in the Philippine Islands appreciate that a correction must be made in this regard. While much literature may be placed in a country, it is the follow-through that counts, and undoubtedly the brothers will correct this matter during 1957, to help the other sheep get gathered to the organization. There is considerable illiteracy in many parts of the country and the brothers have a real problem in helping the people to learn to read and write and to take in the full knowledge that Jehovah has provided through his New World society. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of happenings in the islands during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your interview over radio station DZBB turned out to be a powerful witness. The station manager sent a tape recording of the interview to Cagayan de Oro city in the southern Philippines for rebroadcast over a station there. A man who heard the broadcast in Manila was so impressed that he gladly opened the way for us to use a beautiful university gymnasium for a circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the provincial territories 125 special pioneers and hundreds of regular pioneers have done splendid work in finding, teaching and gathering meek persons who love God’s Word and who show faith by speaking out the glad message of the established kingdom of God. Right now we have 150 isolated groups comprising 2,800 Kingdom publishers who have no association with the 576 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. Of these, only thirty-two are being ministered to by special pioneers. The others depend on regular pioneers or on the semiannual visits of the circuit servants for personal instruction in preaching the good news from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To meet the need Jehovah’s organization is now providing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preaching Together in Unity</span><span class="font3"> in three of the major dialects. Other service counsel is going out in the dialects. The two missionary homes and the branch office have regular classes for the study of the local language. Every effort is being put forth to teach the brothers in the language they understand. This is certain to bring good results. The groundwork is laid for a more concentrated training program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two special pioneer sisters stirred up so much interest in their territory that their landlord shamefully yielded to pressure from jealous religious elements and told the sisters they would have to leave his home. People of good will found a better home for the sisters and helped them gather more interest by personally engaging in the preaching work. During your visit to the Philippines these two sisters brought along fourteen others to enjoy our Triumphant Kingdom assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s counsel on wedlock and the simple, dignified ceremony conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses at weddings have called forth many favorable comments. A devout Catholic lady attended a wedding ceremony solemnized in the home of one of Jehovah’s witnesses. After the service she exclaimed: “What a beautiful and simple service! How wonderful to see young people receiving godly counsel on marriage responsibilities right in the home of their parents and then going forth with the divine and the parental blessing to establish a home of their own! When my children grow up and marry </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">want the same kind of wedding ceremony for them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In closing this report, Brother Knorr, I wish to say that the Kingdom publishers in the Philippines are grateful to Jehovah for the visit you made with your companions, Brother Don Adams and Brother Lloyd Barry. The counsel you gave us and the subsequent visit of the zone servant helped so very much in getting our office organization properly established. Now we can concentrate on the field organization, giving attention to the “training of the holy ones for ministerial work.”—Eph. 4: 12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark328"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A report comes out of Poland as to the abounding joy that the brothers have. According to Brother Scheider, the branch servant there who has recently been released from prison, “everything moves and is kept moving by the mainspring of the joy of the Lord.” We rejoice with our brothers in Poland that they have come out from under much persecution, and the government is now making further careful investigation of their activities and is allowing them greater freedom. In August of 1956 they reached an all-time peak in publishers in Poland and the officials who rule that land recognize that Jehovah’s witnesses are a thriving organization. Many high officials of the state have racked their brains as to how to solve the problem of Jehovah’s witnesses. Why do they not assimilate themselves into the state and become part of it? is the question in their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One very prominent state official said: “I am enthused about your stand.” He further went on to say that there are three main reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses have been reconsidered by the government in Poland, and they are these: (1) The teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses have not changed in spite of the ban for six years. (2) That despite arrests and many other difficulties they courageously and fearlessly continue to practice their religion. (3) That during the whole period of the ban their numbers quadrupled. There is no question in our minds that Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to preserve their uncompromising stand on the side of Jehovah and for his kingdom, and this regardless of what may happen to them in the future. They are determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to bring the whole tithe into Jehovah’s storehouse so that they may be recipients of his glorious blessings. They are receiving these blessings, and the reports that have come through for the year show this. Here are a few of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even though the publishers showed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> certain anxiety when starting again in the house-to-house ministry, they returned with such enthusiasm from their first effort that the others seeing their zeal could not help but follow their example. In many cases the zeal is so great that the brothers have to be kept back from going out in too large a group. The results of such group work are very satisfactory. Although the publishers often meet with officials, this does not bring any serious consequences. The work proceeds without disturbance, even in territories where the people were hostile toward Jehovah’s witnesses before the ban, and many show a sincere interest for the message. The publishers were greeted with such remarks as: “We have been waiting a long time for you people and we began to think that you were not coming to us any more.” The people see that they have been deceived by the Catholic clergy and so they are more inclined now to listen to the truth. In a group effort in a certain locality fourteen publishers found interest for the truth in fifty-one homes, and only three dropped out after the first back-call, while the rest of the people were willing to receive further instruction from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The development of a congregation depends to a great extent upon the example given by the congregation servant. In a certain congregation there were seven publishers when the ban struck the work. Now there are four units with a total of one hundred publishers in the territory of that congregation. The reason for such an increase was the diligent work of the congregation servant. This brother has a sickly wife and five small children. Despite this he is first in every feature of congregation activity, thus showing the publishers how personal difficulties can be overcome and Kingdom interests given the first place. Recently this brother has arranged his affairs in such a way that he can do pioneer service. In the same congregation there is a twelve-year-old sister who works diligently from house to house. When she calls upon the people, they sometimes do not want to listen to her at first and say: “What can a little one like you tell us about God?” But after she has given her witness she can often notice tears of joy in the eyes of those witnessed to. This young sister conducts a goodly number of home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We had great joy in welcoming back and taking care of a considerable number of brothers who have returned from Russia. Of course, they are a little backward as regards the knowledge of the truth, yet they are quickly catching up by regularly attending the meetings. Many of these repatriated ones could not get in touch with the brothers except by asking everybody about Jehovah’s witnesses or by going from house to house till they found our brothers. Today they join in the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In many territories the Catholic clergy exercise great influence upon the population still. But the cases of rank hypocritical dealings among them cause more and more people to search for the truth. A sister reported that when going from house to house she met a woman who, after the sister had explained the purpose of her call, asked immediately: &quot;Are you perhaps one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” When the sister said she was, the woman said: “That’s good, for I heard that the truth is with you. At last I have found you!” And then she began to tell her story: “My father was a sexton and faithfully served under a very bad priest who had told him that he would get 20 Zloty [about five dollars] per year for his work (this was twenty years ago). After the year was up the priest told my father that he could not give him 20 Zloty but only 5. And when my father then wanted the 5 Zloty, the priest seized a revolver and yelled in rage: ‘You want to serve God for a recompense? I will give you a recompense.’ My father fled and didn’t go to church any more for the rest of his life (fifteen years). The priest, fearing that this matter might become known, apologized to my father, but this didn’t help any. My father often told us that the truth existed somewhere, but not in the church. ‘Children,’ he said, ‘seek for the truth, keep your eyes open, for the time will come when people will go around and preach the truth as Jesus did, but these will be hated.’ My father died and we often remembered his words in our family and wondered whether you might not be those who preach the truth.” A thorough witness convinced this woman that she had really met those whom her father had mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have also heard of several cases where clergymen expressed themselves favorably about Jehovah’s witnesses from their pulpits. One of them said: “Don’t oppose Jehovah’s witnesses, for we are not sure yet who is on the right way, we or they. Read the Holy Scriptures and these will show you the right way.” A circuit servant reports that while he visited a congregation someone told the priest that a stranger had come to Jehovah’s witnesses. The priest then wrote a letter to the congregation servant, telling him he would like to see “the servant to the brethren.” The circuit servant accepted the invitation and gave the priest a thorough witness. The following Sunday the priest mentioned a number of subjects in his sermon that had been discussed with the circuit servant. The priest asked for further calls.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark329"></a>PORTUGAL,</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Even though the government of Portugal is trying to bring education to the adults there is still a very high percentage of illiteracy in the country. It is because of this illiteracy that the Catholic Church has such tremendous power over the people. Despite this, however, a number of persons are listening to the truth and even though some are unable to read and write they have seized the opportunity of learning, learning God’s message and learning to read and write. There is a sister in one of the congregations in Portugal who is over sixty years of age. She recently started taking lessons on how to read and write, because she felt she was losing too much not being able to understand as she would like. The Society would like to do much more work in Portugal if possible and if representatives are allowed to be sent there, but the local brothers are doing good work in spreading the message of the Kingdom among those needing the comfort. The branch servant there sends us some reports that are very interesting, and he also reports on the Azores Islands and Madeira.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been considerable police interference of late, resulting in the closing down of two of the meeting places and the disappearance of some of the more timid publishers. The more mature ones are being made all the more determined to continue with the preaching of the good news in spite of these things, and there is a greater bond of unity existing among the publishers now than at any previous time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early in the year a publisher contacted a man who had been unemployed through illness for some time, and who was unable to contribute for the literature. The publisher loaned the man several booklets and on the return visit started a study in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font3">At the beginning the man’s wife showed very little interest, being more concerned with her wifely duties. The man’s health gradually deteriorated, while at the same time his knowledge of the truth increased rapidly, and he expressed his desire to be baptized. However, after about two months of studying he died, but not before telling his wife that this was the true religion and that she should, together with her son and young daughter, continue to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. The wife followed his advice and began to show much interest, with the result that after a few months of study she and her son became regular publishers and recently symbolized their dedication by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A lady was spoken to by a publisher and procured two booklets. When the back-call was made by two publishers, the lady was waiting for them, having been told by the publisher that she would receive a visit. The lady invited the publishers into her house, and they answered her questions from the Bible. She related how she had been living in a sinful condition for fourteen years, but she desired salvation and wanted to know what course to take. She was told that first of all she must gain knowledge, and she readily consented to a home Bible study. After two months the study was stopped because the lady left the city in order to leave behind her old way of life and start anew. It took just nine weeks of study with Jehovah’s witnesses for this person to make a decision that she previously thought was impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several years ago a married couple with over twenty years in the Adventist church began studying with one of Jehovah's witnesses only to stop the study after a while because of fear of having to engage in the witness work. About twelve months ago this same couple obtained the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> and began studying again, with the result that both of them have completely abandoned the Adventist church, saying that they have learned more in one year of studying with Jehovah’s witnesses than in all their years at church. They have both attended meetings, and the husband recently began publishing, both having expressed their determination to dedicate their lives to Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark330"></a>AZORES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Working from house to house one day, a publisher was invited inside by the daughter of the householder and he immediately introduced the message to the girl’s father. However, the girl’s mother was very furious and ordered the publisher out of the house, saying that if her husband took any of the literature she would bum it, and burn him as well if necessary. The woman was a stanch Catholic, while her husband was an Adventist, hence the fierce clash of opinions between husband and wife. The publisher simply explained that Jehovah’s witnesses go from house to house seeking people of good will. Repentant of her hasty words, the lady took some literature and the following week a Bible study was started with the entire family. The husband is now a subscriber for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and regularly attends the congregation study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A schoolteacher from another island was one day visiting a house of a friend who is having a Bible study with one of the publishers, and she listened with much attention during the study. Afterward she expressed her sorrow at having taught her pupils such false doctrines as the trinity, and said that she would never do so again. She confessed that she knew nothing of the Bible, and readily accepted literature with instructions as to how she could study when she returned to her own isolated part of the islands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark331"></a>MADEIRA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">One of the Society’s representatives from Portugal paid a visit to the small group of publishers on Madeira, and meetings were held every night of the week during his visit to help the many persons of good will who are showing a keen desire to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. There was a total of over fifty different persons who attended meetings that week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the visit of the Society’s representative a lady was contacted whose daughter in Venezuela had subscribed for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazine for her. This lady had been a stanch Adventist, but she received a great shaking when her young granddaughter was refused admission to the church because she wore a ring. The opportunity to study </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> was quickly grasped by her, with the result that three studies were conducted with her in one week and now this lady’s eyes are being opened to the true religion. Another group of Adventists are also receiving </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">in Portuguese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Five brothers symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion during the year, and we rejoice with these brothers that Jehovah is blessing their work and at the prospects before them for the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark332"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The little island of Puerto Rico has always been crowded, but still they are building thousands and thousands of new homes. There is much prosperity. Television antennas testify that practically everyone has a television set. Whether it is paid for or not one cannot say. There are many new cars on the road and things do look prosperous. With all of these things that people take for granted as a sign of good prosperity, yet the people are filled with unhappiness. They are not pleased with the conditions of the world and they are not satisfied or contented. However, Jehovah’s witnesses have a message of truth and comfort that is going into every nook and corner of the island and it causes people to stop and think. During the past year there have been many blessings enjoyed by the New World society. Showers of blessings have been poured out upon them because of their bringing in spiritual tithes. Jehovah’s witnesses there have the command to preach this good news of the Kingdom and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they are going to go forth and disciple these people as they are being discipled  in all nations. The report of the branch servant in Puerto Rico also covers St. Croix, St. John, St. Thomas and Tortola, all nearby islands in the Caribbean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second district assembly was held in Ponce. Good co-operation was given by the press and radio, and again scenes were shown on television. One of the brothers who had appeared in one of the views, on entering a business establishment, heard a woman exclaim to another, “There’s one of them,” as she motioned to the brother to come over. She explained that they were studying evolution and their instructor had recommended the booklet  </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution versus The New World</span><span class="font3"> to read. She had seen the brother on the television program and recognized him as one of Jehovah’s witnesses and one able to get her the desired booklet, which the brother happily did later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The assemblies are a wonderful method of giving a very concentrated witness over a particular area, and this is backed by the following experiences: A pioneer sister was calling on the homes of the people in search of rooms for the coming assembly. She contacted a strongly Catholic woman whom she had visited before. The woman had admitted previously that she was disgusted with the priests. On being approached on the subject of rooms, she answered: “What! Me give rooms to Jehovah’s witnesses! I would have to confess to the priest.” The sister answered that she would not have to, and stated: “I’ve shown you love; surely you can show love to your neighbor by giving him shelter.” The woman thought for a moment and then said: “All right, I can take two ladies.” At the assembly the pioneer was surprised to see the Catholic woman. She had come with the pioneer sister who was staying at her home. She said: “This is wonderful. I could stay for days. When I go to mass I’m waiting for it to finish to go home, but here I want it to go on.” This young woman is now studying, has thrown out her images, has bought a Catholic Bible, which she uses to preach to her family and friends, and attends the meetings regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus said: “Therefore do not fear them; for there is nothing covered over that will not become uncovered, and secret that will not become known.” (Matt. 10:26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> There is a great deal of spiritism being practiced in Puerto Rico and this was exposed as completely false and without any Scriptural basis in the series of articles that were published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower (La Atalaya).</span><span class="font3"> A publisher tells of studying with a person who did not seem to manifest any special interest until the subject of spiritism was touched upon. Later he found that she was a medium. By the publisher’s going into the matter thoroughly, she began to see the truth and her position in relation to it. To break free was hard, almost costing her her husband, home and job. But sticking firmly to what she recognized as truth, she maintained all three, besides freeing herself from demonism.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark333"></a>ST. CROIX</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The film “The New World Society in Action” has been shown quite extensively here, with favorable results. It was shown after the public lecture of a circuit assembly to an attentive audience of 210. The following week it was shown three nights consecutively to groups of workers in their camps. One night a religious group under the name of “Burning Bush” came to preach their religion to the men, but they had no one to talk to, for they were all watching the film. The following night they beat the brothers to the place where they were going to show the film and distributed a leaflet against Jehovah’s witnesses, but they all attended the picture, carrying the leaflet in their hands. Some had come in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses on other islands and were surprised to find them in St. Croix too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Missionaries were sent to St. Croix to hunt out some of the “other sheep” to organize them for study and service. Many thought that the missionaries would not stay, as the field was a fruitless one for other religious sects, which had left. Today there are two congregations that continue to survive in spite of religious pressure, low moral standards and spiritual apathy. If it be Jehovah’s will they are there to stay and will serve as spiritual food-supplying centers for those who are spiritually hungry. Their presence and continued activity are visible evidence of God’s established kingdom and will give hope and faith to many more before the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark334"></a>ST. JOHN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Several years ago this island assumed an importance in God’s view, as it became involved in the theocratic activity that was being carried on throughout the earth. It was included among the nations receiving the witness through the preaching of the “good news” of the established kingdom. A small congregation was formed for the benefit of the group of Jehovah’s witnesses on the island and the other persons who might be of good will toward God. The circuit servant makes regular visits to these brothers, and they attend the circuit assemblies on the other islands regularly. They are a part of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark335"></a>ST. THOMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Without doubt Jehovah did pour out an abundant blessing on his servants in St. Thomas during the past service year. Previously, the one congregation had slowly dwindled from a peak of fifty-nine publishers in April of 1951 to twenty-two publishers in February, 1955. The service year ended on a gloomy note. To start out the new service year a district assembly was arranged after the style of the Triumphant Kingdom assemblies, which had already taken place in the United States and Europe. The Society’s missionary boat Light was in the area and co-operated in bringing the brothers from the three neighboring islands of St. Croix, St. John and Tortola. A goodly number came from Puerto Rico by plane. It was a wonderful assembly and the spiritual food served was stimulating and strengthening. The public lecture was given in the city park, followed by the film. Five hundred and fifty persons were present and many of them were greatly impressed by what they heard and saw. A woman approached one of the publishers the Tuesday after the assembly and asked if Jehovah’s witnesses were holding another meeting that evening. She had attended the public talk and had seen the film and was so impressed that she wanted to hear and see more.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark336"></a>TORTOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Two brothers joined the pioneer ranks last year and are doing splendid work. One is a special pioneer and the other a vacation pioneer. They do their share of walking to keep the truth before the people. The sisters too walk great distances to visit the people and teach them the Bible. They have to climb mountains and follow rocky paths to find everyone. It reminds one of the prophecy of Jeremiah 16:16, where he prophesies that Jehovah would send his servants to fish and hunt for the persons of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The high light of the service year for the brothers in Tortola was their circuit assembly in July. They played the host to their brothers and persons of good will from the other islands. Over one hundred were in attendance right from the beginning, although there are only twelve publishers on the island. The new film “The Happiness of the New World Society” was shown here for the first time and over 400 turned out to see it. It, together with the assembly, gave a great witness to the people in the vicinity. Much interest was awakened and several new studies have been started.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark337"></a>ROMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Communications with Romania during the year have not been very frequent. It seems as though we have been able to get much helpful information in the way of spiritual food in to the brothers, but their communications with us have not been very informative. There is still much internal pressure to try to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. During the year a few of our brothers were released from prison camps. This, of course, was good news; but as the months passed by word came through that these particular brothers had again lost the freedom that they had gained. It may be that some of these have had Communist brainwashings, and after being released from prison they have caused difficulty among their own brothers. There is no question that Satan and his whole organization are trying to disrupt Jehovah’s witnesses internally and externally; so everyone must be on his guard to seek first the Kingdom interests and stay close to God’s Word by studying it and living by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just what has been done in Romania in the way of the proclamation of the Kingdom has not been reported, but we feel certain that there are thousands of brothers there, as there have been in former years, and these we believe are still faithful. They did learn of the Triumphant Kingdom assemblies in Europe and much of the information that was brought to the attention of Jehovah’s people throughout the world through those assemblies has been given to our brothers in Romania, so they should be strong. We pray for them continually and hope the day will come when greater freedom will be theirs and open communications can be enjoyed. All those dedicated to Jehovah will give him exclusive devotion, preferring to lose their lives rather than compromise with the present system of things. We have confidence that Jehovah’s spirit is upon them and guiding them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark338"></a>RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Joy and tears were expressed at the district assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide during 1956. Joy because of the love of the brothers throughout the world for their fellow workers in Russia, and tears because of the knowledge of the sorrow and suffering that must be endured by those of the New World society in Russia. Petitions have been sent to Premier Bulganin from all parts of the world. Notices have been delivered to the embassies in various countries. Many people of the Russian government have been interviewed. Months have passed and still no acknowledgment has come of the petitions of these Christians. To the rulers of the Kremlin there is no God. They just worship themselves and the state and try to make slaves of all the people. And especially do they try to make slaves of those who believe in a Kingdom of righteousness that will bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. The dedicated servants of Jehovah world-wide will continue to pray to their God in heaven to pour out an abundant measure of his spirit upon those who are in servitude, those who are suffering and going through great trials; for we know of their difficulties, and as days go by and months and years still more experiences come to our ears from out of Russia. A few brief ones are published herewith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We can say that in the course of the service year 1956 much has been done in Russia in the interests of the Kingdom. Although there was a lack of organization and the brothers had to contend with many serious difficulties, we in Russia think that apart from those in exile and in concentration camps there are many others who are preaching the good news of the Kingdom, engaging in the work of comforting those that mourn. Of all that are known to be in the truth today in Russia it is concluded that forty percent have received the truth in prison and in camps. Among them there are even officers of the army, police, prison officials, lawyers and journalists. At last they have found a freedom, the truth. The truth has set them free in their mind, even though they are still held in these prison camps. One experience is reported of a woman who worked in a cottonspinning mill, where she enjoyed general popularity and sympathy from all her fellow workers even though she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She was the only witness in the factory, and one day while she was working at her machine the examining magistrate entered. Everybody knew that the appearance of this man meant an arrest for someone, and this woman’s name was called out. She was told to put on her clothes for outdoors and go with the magistrate, but immediately all the other workers ran toward her and surrounded her and would not let him take her away. There was a rebellion because of the removal of one of Jehovah’s witnesses, though she was the only one. Finally the manager of the plant promised that no harm would be done to the woman and that she would be returned to work. It was just a matter of looking into some things. So the other people went back to work and allowed her to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the police got hold of her they subjected her to severe examination; they beat her and wanted her to reveal where other witnesses were who were in the truth. But through the torture she would not reveal any of her fellow workers who were preaching the Kingdom. They demanded in their rage that she deny her religion and ordered her to sign papers that made her swear that she would never tell anything that happened to her in this police interview, and then they would let her go. Although she returned to the factory, within a few days she was taken away from her flat and disappeared. She was transported to Siberia. She was not alone in this movement, but was with many other Jehovah’s witnesses, and as they passed through the villages the people would ask who they were and they would reply that they were Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus they had opportunity to witness to the people. In one village the gathering work of taking Jehovah's witnesses into exile involved a sister ninety-nine years of age. When she was asked the question, Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses? she said yes. They gave her two hours to change her mind and deny her belief in God, but this she refused to do. She answered them that she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that she wanted to serve Jehovah to the end of her life. She was taken along to Siberia with the rest. What a strong government! The Russian government fearful of a ninety-nine-year-old woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The journey was long and many stops were made. The curious people watching these transports talked to the brothers and asked questions. They wanted to know who the witnesses were, why they were being deported. Placards were made with material they could get hold of and signs were hung out; “Here Jehovah’s witnesses Go into Banishment for Having Preached the Gospel.” Other banners read:“Because of Our Faith in Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One place where the train stopped a large crowd assembled alongside the train and one of the brothers climbed onto the baggage and talked to them. As he gave them the comforting message of God’s kingdom, many had tears in their eyes. There was a watchman’s hut nearby and the watchman came out to see what was going on. When the watchman saw what was happening he shouted to the brothers: “Move away from the window and stop talking or the one speaking will be shot!” The brother answered: “You can do so if you want to, as I am going into banishment anyway,” and he continued to talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No matter where Jehovah’s witnesses have gone throughout the country of Russia they continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Reds call every camp an educational camp, regardless of its filth and the depravity of those in such camps. It is hard to tell people what actually happens in many of these barracks where sadistic pleasures are carried on by men with evil minds. One person writes that he spent fifteen years in Russia and fourteen of them were spent in camps. Now he is back in Poland. It was not until 1955 that he met a brother for the first time. After much torture and trial and persecution he came out alive singing the song of gratitude to Jehovah’s praise. He says that he spent fifteen years of his life in “death valley” and its vicinity. If it had not been for the truth he feels he would not be alive today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With rejoicing and gladness the New World society in Russia, most of whom are in prison camps, sing the praises of the Most High and are glad that the brothers who are not in camps in other parts of the world have freedom to preach, and they pray for all of them that they may be faithful in their conduct before Jehovah God. They, along with all others, want to see this good news of the Kingdom preached so that the end can come for this old, wicked world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark339"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For a number of years now the increase in publishers has not shown up in Sierra Leone and we have often wondered why. During the 1956 service year it was observed that one of the prominent publishers in the organization had brought dishonor upon the truth and many of the townspeople knew about it. This wrongdoing has been cleared out. It is certain that if the brothers in Sierra Leone now work to gain more knowledge and maturity and all together recognize Jehovah’s organization and preach together in unity, and if they continue to fight against the wicked spirit forces, then Jehovah’s blessing will be upon them. If they keep pace with the New World society and co-operate with the servants of the organization and keep clean, there is no question that the spirit of Jehovah will flow freely within the organization there. We sincerely hope that all the trouble is removed and that those publishers who are there now will devote themselves wholly to Kingdom interests. We feel sure that then Jehovah will gather in the other sheep to his organization. As long as uncleanness is allowed to remain, then we can feel sure that those who love truth and righteousness will not be coming in. That is why there has been no increase in Sierra Leone since 1953. The branch servant there reports on some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sheeplike persons can quickly distinguish the Right Shepherd’s comforting message from the empty words of false shepherds. In an isolated village a missionary gave them the chance to do so and even the false shepherd could see the difference. The missionary reports: “I was working from house to house when I came across a group of more than fifteen people. I introduced myself as a minister of the good news. One man got up and introduced me to the pastor of the local C.M.S. Church and many other prominent village officials. All listened as I gave the sermon on the ‘Kingdom of the New World,’ using scriptures to support everything that was stated. After I finished, one got up and, speaking for the group, he said, ‘Thank you so much. This is the kind of talk a minister should give to comfort the people. Before you came we were talking nothing spiritual, but only foolishness and frivolities.’ They took all the literature I had. I got more at my lodging. The total placements were nine books, seventeen booklets and nine magazines. The pastor acted very much ashamed and decided he too had better have ‘some comfort from the Scriptures’ and so took a booklet, the latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Make Sure of All Things’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our first experience distributing handbills for the film “The New World Society in Action” was a splendid success. We wondered just how many would come. The largest hall in Freetown was rented, with 500 chairs. Half an hour before the film began only about twenty-five persons had arrived and we began to feel that the Kingdom Hall would have been adequate. We had distributed a thousand invitations, but it looked as if not many would accept. However, in the next fifteen minutes a hundred more came. Yes, they came and kept coming, one after another, as darkness began to fall. All 500 seats were soon filled. One hundred more came and said they did not mind standing to watch. The film started on time, but the good-will people continued to come. They had been invited to see “The New World Society in Action” and they wanted to see it. Soon the brothers in charge of the door reported that several hundred had assembled outside to see the film, but there was no standing room left. What could be done? Would they wait one and a half hours till it was shown the first time and then come in for a second showing? Yes, they would. Over 500 persons waited for the second showing even though it was raining!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark340"></a>SINGAPORE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">“Happy is he whose hope is in Jehovah his God,” said the psalmist. Those of the New World society look back over the past year and observe the blessings of Jehovah God and they are happy. While there was not a great increase in publishers in Singapore, still the organization is stronger because those working there are now building on a stronger foundation, and they look forward to future increases. During the year they had a wonderful Triumphant Kingdom assembly. They were enriched with the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers</span><span class="font4"> and for the field they now have the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World.</span><span class="font4"> The government of Malaya does not want the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font4"> magazines to come into that territory, so most of the work is done in Singapore, but even so the witnesses carry the message to the northern part of the peninsula. The little work that is done in North Borneo is also cared for by the Singapore branch. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We felt a special blessing in having Brother Knorr and Brother Adams visit us at the end of March. It made us feel closer to the theocratic organization. It made our hope in Jehovah’s kingdom firmer, our happiness in his service greater and our desire to press on in the preaching work keener. A grand witness was given through advertising the public talk “Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator.” Following the assembly the brothers were greatly stimulated by a wide distribution of the April 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> with its thrilling message for all people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our first circuit assembly outside Singapore was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. Some fifty brothers from various parts of the peninsula and Singapore were present, giving a splendid witness to that territory. A good-will person from a town eighty miles away attended the assembly. He had been a Buddhist and spent large sums of money at various temples seeking a cure for high blood pressure. Eventually he got cured in a government hospital. This shook his belief in “faith healing.” He was overjoyed with the friendly spirit that prevailed at the assembly and after seeing the Society’s film exclaimed: “I never saw anything like this before!” Now he is having a regular Bible study in his home with one of the brothers in his town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A Chinese person who was embittered against Christianity because of the injustices he felt the Western nations had committed in the East took the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font3"> “just to please the missionary” who called at his door. However, after studying with the publisher for two weeks he accompanied the brother in the field service. He was called to read the script in Chinese at a showing of the Society’s film during the circuit servant’s visit. The love and unity he saw displayed on the screen convinced him that here was an organization that was entirely different from anything he had seen in this old world. He began attending meetings and joined the ministry school. Now within a few weeks after his first study he goes from door to door giving six- to eight-minute sermons in Chinese and English and is conducting two Chinese home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Malayan government declined to lift the ban from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines after Brother Knorr’s visit here. A subsequent appeal and a petition sent to the chief minister by sixty delegates at the Kuala Lumpur circuit assembly also brought a refusal from the head of the government to have the ban removed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark341"></a>NORTH BORNEO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">For a number of years we have ‘begged the Master of the harvest to send out workers Into his harvest’ in this country. We rejoice that our prayers have been answered. A brother and his wife from the Philippines took on secular work in Tawau on the east coast of Borneo, where they are zealously preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. Toward the close of the service year they were joined by two more brothers also from the Philippines. This has resulted in a new peak of nine publishers for Borneo. A congregation will shortly be organized in this town, and we are confident that some of the seed these brothers are sowing in this virgin territory will in due time bear fruit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark342"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The branch office in South Africa looks after a large territory and has made a very interesting report on all the countries under its jurisdiction. It has been a very slow year as far as increase is concerned in practically all the territories, but still a very fine witness has been given and many persons have been baptized, especially in the Union of South Africa. Some years seem to be stabilizing years; that is, there are times when publishers must be brought on to maturity and must get set for future work. Surely our brothers in all of South Africa will be looking to the year’s text for 1957, which states: “From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (Ps. 96: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> With this as their central theme undoubtedly advances will be made as never before. It is essential that those in the truth be brought on to maturity and that the overseers feed the sheep of God and take the proper lead before them. The branch office in South Africa makes reports on its own country as well as Angola, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, St. Helena, South-West Africa and Swaziland. Interesting experiences have been had in all of these places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The outstanding event during the past service year was the visit of Brother M. G. Henschel and the Triumphant Kingdom assembly held at Johannesburg October 20 to 23. At first it seemed we would not have Brother Henschel with us, as the Department of the Interior, after having issued a visa, later canceled it. Just the day before he was due to arrive decision was reversed and the necessary visa was issued, but with the reservation that no public speeches would be permitted. However, after the Secretary for the Interior had a look at Brother Henschel and had several chats with him Brother Henschel received the green light and everything went forward as originally planned. This victory brought great joy to all the brothers in this country and the national assembly proved to be the best yet. On Sunday afternoon 10,754 listened to the talk on “World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom.” At the immersion 407 symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. The new releases arrived in the nick of time. They were unloaded at the coast by brothers who volunteered for the job. They were then rushed up by diesel truck to Johannesburg, arriving late on Saturday night, and all of them were released on Sunday. What a day that was! And what an assembly! Jehovah certainly opened the windows of heaven and poured out many rich blessings so that there was no room left to receive them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The distribution of the April 1 issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> was another happy experience. We were privileged to print 147,000 in eight languages on our own press for the Union and the countries to the north. With English and other European languages in addition a very wide distribution was effected. For the first time 100,000 magazines were distributed in one month in the Union. The all-around increase in magazine distribution throughout the year has been most marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The special holidays in December were again taken advantage of by many zealous publishers and excellent results were obtained. The following is a typical example: “On the first special magazine day eight of us placed 154 magazines and 33 booklets within two hours. On the second day eight of us placed 167 magazines within the same period of time.” The African brothers are sharing in this success. From one congregation the congregation servant advised that one publisher placed fifty magazines in one hour; another twenty-eight in fifteen minutes and another one placed forty-three in twenty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Good work has also been done by means of the post. A woman living in a country district had one of the books but no one to help her with a study. Later she found herself in a hospital in one of the towns. In the next bed was a sister who witnessed to her. After leaving the hospital the sister kept up a correspondence with this woman, conducting a postal Bible study with her. The woman soon became active and when the circuit servant called quite a few others in that isolated part of the country knew about the truth and were just waiting to receive literature. The lady herself and her husband have invited the circuit servant to stay there next time he is in the district.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark343"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Toward the end of last service year the missionary who visited Angola on a temporary visa, after receiving two extensions granting him the maximum of five months allowed on a temporary permit, was obliged to leave the country. This was unfortunate, for he had made a number of important contacts and was about to visit the various groups who claimed to know something about the truth and who were scattered throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the island of Sao Thome, which lies off the coast of Angola, a number of brothers, having served their seven years’ detention imposed upon them by the Portuguese authorities for their preaching activities in Mo-Cambique, were released and returned to their homeland. These included the former congregation servant, and since his departure reports have not been so regular. However, it is a joy to report that the brothers on the island reached or passed their 20-percent increase in publishers on four occasions during the year. Practically all of these brothers are serving various periods of detention on banana plantations for preaching the good news of God’s kingdom in East Africa.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark344"></a>BASUTOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">An interesting experience concerns a young boy of fourteen who accepted the truth while attending school some distance from his own home. He was staying with his religious aunt, who, on learning that the boy was associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, asked the boy’s teacher for advice. The teacher, hoping that he could frighten the boy out of this way, asked why he was associating with the witnesses, What about his parents’ church? etc. He failed to get the boy to part with the truth; so he told the boy’s aunt they could not change the boy’s mind; they should not ill-treat him, but he would expel the boy from his school before he spoiled other children, as a rotten potato spoils other potatoes if allowed to be among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the father got to know why the boy had been expelled from school he asked the boy to choose between leaving the witness work and forever leaving his parents and his home. The boy’s wise choice and bold stand for the truth so enraged the father that he threatened to shoot the boy, telling him that he would not be safe if he went overseas, since he knows the headquarters of the witnesses is in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Off the boy went from his home and got employment in a town outside Basutoland where some witnesses stay. Here he was strengthened in faith. To show that he was still loyal to his father the boy wrote kind letters to him telling where he was and explaining the truth. After some time the boy, accompanied by another brother, visited his home. This time the father’s anger had abated; he even attended a public meeting that these two friends arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Later on the father asked his son to return home, promising that he would not do any harm to him. On his arrival he was called before the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">khotia</span><span class="font3"> (tribal council) to account for his behavior. Here again the boy stood boldly for the truth until his uncle, who had once read some of the Society’s publications, stood for him, talking in favor of the witnesses. The father realized that it was foolish for him to have threatened his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now the father has willingly allowed the boy to work as a publisher and has agreed to educate him again. The boy has forward-looking plans, is considering pioneering and is a great asset to the local congregation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark345"></a>BECHUANALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">After a somewhat slow start in the early part of the year, which was mainly owing to opposition and some uncleanness, the work picked up during the past six months. In considerable measure this is because of a number of special pioneers who were sent into the country from the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The opposition is still very strong in some centers, and at the end of August one of our specials was driven out of the country and two of the local brothers were sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. This was not for doing any wrong but simply because they belonged to “the Watch Tower Church” and insisted on reading and teaching the Bible to others against the wishes of the chief. These African chiefs wield considerable power, and British officials at Mafeking, who try to guide them in a supervisory capacity, permit them to get away with too much. Just a year ago all postmasters and magistrates in the country received a letter from the government secretary reminding them that while the importation of the literature was prohibited, the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses were not banned in any other way. The African chief who sentenced the local brothers to imprisonment and ordered the special pioneer to leave the country had such letter before his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">kgotla,</span><span class="font3"> and both he and his counselors insisted that the letter meant they were banned in every way. A protest has been sent to the chief concerned and a copy filed with the governmental authorities at Mafeking.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark346"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In this island of less than 5,000 inhabitants there has been no increase in publishers during the past year. They average about one publisher for every 112 people on the island. Although their field is thus restricted and scope for increase is not so great as in some other territories there are a number of very encouraging features in their report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An interesting feature of the circuit servant’s visit was the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action.” It was shown eight times and over a thousand saw it, or better than one fifth of the entire population. Use of schoolrooms and the government power machine and generator were refused, so the film had to be shown out-of-doors. A friendly hotel proprietor loaned his power plant and with the help of a loudspeaker run from a battery, which the circuit servant had taken with him, all who witnessed the film on numerous hillsides around the island could hear what was being said by way of explanation. As a result of the refusal to give us the use of the schoolrooms and what they saw on the film many on the island now have their eyes opened and know who compose the old-world society and who the new. One night it rained during the entire showing, but eighty persons remained throughout. At the end a European man, who was one of the audience, remarked: “It was a marvelous show; you have a wonderful organization.” Another remarked to one of the brothers: “I am not ashamed to tell you, tears were running down my face and other boys were affected the same way.” Asked why, he replied: “To see how the brothers work together in love; if only we could work like that.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark347"></a>SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Members of the New World society are obliged to use four languages to give an effective witness in that country. In street work the magazines are offered in Afrikaans, English and German, and booklets in Hereto are carried for the Africans. The house-to-house work follows the same pattern; the witness is alert to catch the language spoken in the home and then gives the sermon in German, Afrikaans or English as required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The high light of the past year was the first full-scale circuit assembly with the visit of both circuit and district servants. There were sixty-five present on Sunday and six were immersed. The circuit assembly program was greatly appreciated and as the brothers had “The New World Society in Action” film with them this served to increase the joy and gratitude of all present. One newly interested sister living 200 miles away from Windhoek found that the bus was already full. She told the bus conductor that she must go even if she had to stand. She did and stood eight hours on top of her suitcase, because there was not even a place for it. After the meetings Saturday evening she said: “I would not have missed this meeting for a thousand pounds.” Before the assembly was over some were inquiring when the next one would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One missionary operating in the northern part of the territory by car serves some half-dozen small towns. He cannot have studies each week with all the interest, but has been writing letters between visits. Several have been helped to take a stand for the truth in this way. They have appreciated this brother’s tender affection for the isolated and scattered sheep and have made rapid progress.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark348"></a>SWAZILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The various showings of the film “The New World Society in Action” have helped much to break down prejudice and increase interest in the Kingdom message in Swaziland. It is too bad that the continued ban on the importation of the literature by the white man makes it impossible to help these interested people, both European and African, as much as we wish to. A further effort to have the ban lifted during the year resulted in warning notices’ being sent out by the High Commissioner’s office to all three Protectorates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result of religious prejudice permission to hold a circuit assembly at one point in Swaziland was at first refused by the district commissioner. However, the assistant commissioner and sergeant of police spoke up on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses and told the commissioner: “Jehovah’s witnesses are a peaceful organization, not in Swaziland only, but throughout the world. The Society’s film is a religious film and we think permission should be given them to hold their assembly.” Permission was eventually given to hold the assembly and to show the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The African religious leaders continue to try to influence the Paramount Chief of the Swazis against Jehovah's witnesses. This man has read the Society’s literature, has been a subscriber for the magazines, and has no objection to either the literature or work of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Society. If he had the last word the ban on the Society's literature would have been lifted long ago. He knows the literature could have only a helpful influence on the African mind. He loves to put the African clergymen into confusion. So each year on “Good Friday” he invites all the clergymen to his Royal Kraal and then calls upon one of Jehovah’s witnesses to make a speech. This year the witness spoke on the immortality of the soul and honorary titles of religious leaders. When he was finished the Paramount Chief asked the clergymen: “Are these things said here by Jehovah’s witnesses true or false? If false, state how.” Shamefacedly they all admitted that they were true. The Paramount Chief then concluded with: “Let Jehovah’s witnesses in Swaziland teach the truth to the Royal Kraal and to you religious clergymen at this center now and in years to come.” What a responsibility rests upon the shoulders of European supervisors who try to keep the truth from the people!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark349"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s blessing brings increase. A knowledge of this truth has kept the mature brothers fighting zealously through a temporary lapse period in Southern Rhodesia. There has been a nice increase in publishers this year, the magazine work has improved tremendously and we are happy that the message of truth can be taken to Africans throughout all of this vast territory. We rejoice to know that there are 324 congregations established. It is essential that all of those in positions of overseers be mature and well acquainted with the service of God and his Word and be able to teach others. The unity of Jehovah’s organization is marvelous. It makes us glad that we are all of one nation under God. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An African circuit servant told of a man and his wife who were known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Zidakwas,</span><span class="font3"> or drunkards. Then they became Jehovah’s witnesses. One day the brother became a bit ill and asked his employer for some medicine. He was answered: “You’re not sick; you drank beer yesterday and that is what made you sick.” The brother then told him that he was now one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that he would not be drunk nor would he deceive his employer. That evening the man went to see a pioneer brother to ask him if what his worker said was true; the pioneer assured him that it was. The reply was: “So that’s why he is so clean and healthy again and my work is going along so well.” This brother is just one of many who are bringing a very favorable light on Jehovah’s organization by changing their past bad course of conduct. Clearly this is one of the reasons why Jehovah is blessing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The increase is coming from every type of person in all walks of life and all ages. One native circuit servant’s boy of nine was left behind one day because his father and mother had to walk many miles to the contact point and territory. The boy wept, for he loved to go in the service. When the parents returned from their service at midnight the boy was fast asleep in the home where they were staying. In the morning the circuit servant was told by the neighbors that his son had taken eight witness children of from four to eleven years of age in the house-to-house work, training them to offer magazines. He counseled them ‘just like daddy does’ and he let each take a house to put the counsel into practice. Three magazines were placed for a contribution of twelve ears of corn. This aroused the local interest and when the public talk began there were 209 in attendance at this congregation of thirty-three publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But also see how the aged are playing their part in the advancement of the New World society. A very old man in one of the native congregations has been a witness since 1928. His age has been estimated to be over a hundred years. When he heard the district servant in his yard (for now he is blind) he threw up his hands and leaped for joy as he exclaimed: “I never thought I would live to witness the day when one of my European brothers would be right here in my own yard!” Next day at the group study when at the close of the meeting questions were asked for, he rose to his feet and said: “One thing worries me now that I’m blind, brother. I can’t do as much service as I used to; can you advise me what I must do?” He was encouraged to take full advantage of every opportunity as it presented itself, such as preaching to anybody who visited him. But his impatience was soon felt and he was not pacified until concrete arrangements were made for a brother to be assigned to help him and lead him out into the service every week. Only then was he happy. Who can say one is too old for the training program?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another value of two brothers’ working together is seen here during the time of planting corn and other grains, when the people cannot be found in their homes. Jehovah’s witnesses follow the householders to the fields and while one brother takes the hoe and starts planting or weeding for the person, the other brother witnesses to him. Sisters do the same when the lady of the house is found pounding out grain. One sister does the work for her while the other relaxes her with the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark350"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">During the year of 1956 much good work has been done in Spain. The New World society has been growing and many persons who love truth and righteousness have been searching out Jehovah’s witnesses and, on the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses have been searching out those interested in everlasting life. It is interesting to see how the other sheep are drawn to the New World society, for it is there that they can study the Word of God freely and learn about truth and righteousness. All of Jehovah’s witnesses will be happy to know of the prosperity of the work in Spain, even though there is great opposition and the Catholic Church does not want the Word of God preached. They want only to have their tradition preached. There are some interesting reports that have come out of that country and all will enjoy reading them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Merely carrying Watchtower literature has been considered illegal. In Madrid four persons, on leaving the house of a sister, were carried off by two civil guards to the police station. Although they were not working in the district, somebody had reported their entry to the house and said they were making anti-Catholic propaganda. The station sergeant said that the fact that they were carrying this literature in territory under his jurisdiction made it necessary for him to make a full report to the &quot;Dirección de Seguridad.” When another pioneer went to the railway station to make inquiries about train times, he was asked for his documentation; as he did not have his identity card with him they searched his bag. For having the Society’s literature he was fined five hundred pesetas, but he went to prison for a month instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some brothers, although physically sick, have encouraged their fellow publishers by their healthy spiritual condition. In Barcelona a brother eighteen years old is seriously ill with heart trouble. He was taken to a hospital where nuns kept worrying him to confess and take communion. The priest brought along an image, saying: ‘‘You are dying; your only hope is to kiss it, confess to me and receive the last rites.” Carlos refused; although he could speak only in a whisper, he asked the priest to show in the Bible where this was commanded. The priest got angry and turning to Carlos’ mother asked: “What kind of religion is this?” She, although not in the truth, quickly answered: “The Bible religion.” The priest stalked off, instructing the nuns to burn the Roman Catholic Nacar-Colunga Bible, but the mother hid it and then carried it home. The attitude of the false comforters has opened the eyes of these parents, whose other son is a pioneer in southern Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A brother tried to help a lady of good will overcome her doubts and agreed to an interview with a Dominican monk. Ten people were gathered when the brown-robed preacher and his Nacar-Colunga Bible arrived. At first he pushed aside the Bible, but later, to prove the correctness of traditional teachings of men, began feverishly searching the gospel of John. Helping him out, the brother cited the last verse of John and then explained it. The impressively bearded holy man subsided with a gasp. After three hours, sweating from the top of his tonsured head to the tip of his sandaled toes, he made his escape from the discussion; but already some of the ten had made their escape from Satan’s prison house. Their jailer could not resist the liberating force of Jehovah’s Word and spirit. Two of the ten are regular publishers now. Later the lady of good will was told by the monk’s sister that afterward he said that we have the true religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark351"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The big event for the service year in Surinam was the Triumphant Kingdom assembly, which was held in Paramaribo. This was the first five-day assembly for our brothers in this country. It followed the pattern of all other assemblies held last year, and they had some tape recordings from the assembly in The Hague, Netherlands. At the public meeting they had 591 people in attendance, twice as many as ever before at a public meeting. This proved to be a tremendous witness for the entire country and the newspapers helped to publicize it. The work went ahead very well in Surinam during the 1956 service year and they reached a new all-time peak of 200 ministers of the Kingdom in June. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences of this country right on the fringe of the jungle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Among the forty-four new brothers who symbolized their dedication by water baptism was our first Bush Negro brother. Two of our missionaries met him on a trip through the bush. When they visited his village he was working in the fields. On returning and hearing of the missionaries who had visited his village he decided to look for them. For two hours he paddled in his little dugout canoe, and his face radiated happiness when he finally found them. For more than three hours the truth was explained to him, and when the Bush Negro left he took the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font3">with him and promised to come to Paramaribo to learn more of the truth. He kept his promise. After a few weeks he came to our missionary home and for three successive days we studied with him. On his return to the bush he had received enough knowledge to be able to stand firm. In spite of much opposition he kept witnessing and studying. When our Triumphant Kingdom assembly came near, the branch sent him an invitation, and at the assembly he symbolized his dedication and has since been a regular publisher. He attends all meetings, and in spite of poor schooling he made eighty points in the last written review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That assemblies serve as a good witness was shown at our circuit assembly in Moengo. A special pioneer has been working there for two years now with hap-pifying results. An assembly such as this was something the inhabitants of this bauxite town had never seen before. One hundred and twelve brothers traveled on a chartered boat for twelve hours, taking pleasure in watching the beautiful river banks sliding silently by. Although we arrived at six o’clock that same evening, exactly at seven o’clock our meeting started. In just one hour the brothers were able to transport everything to the assembly place, arrange for a cafeteria, install the sound equipment and build the platform. The assembly proved to be a real success in spite of the fact that this place is sometimes called “Sodom,” because of its immorality. Two hundred and seventy-five attended the Saturday evening session. Since the assembly the home where the congregational meetings were held has become too small. Over twenty persons are attending the meetings regularly now, six have been baptized and twelve are reporting field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the service year the circuit servant and one of the missionaries were able to pay a visit to Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana. After an interesting trip by air over the forests of French Guiana, they arrived at their destination. In just one week of preaching they placed fifty books and they gave out into the hands of the public over two hundred booklets. On the last day several Bible studies were held with people they had met before during the week. On that evening the film “The New World Society in Action” was shown to a well-filled hall. In this land of leprosy and many other tropical diseases some people are now beginning to appreciate the value of spiritual healing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On their return home the two missionaries were able to show the film at Albina, a frontier town of Surinam. The chief of police had arranged for the film, and even did the advertising. We had never seen such a variety of people as appeared at that showing. Besides the Creoles, Bush Negroes and some white people, there were some wild Indians, who only recently had come in contact with civilization for the first time. Over 250 people attended and showed great appreciation for the film.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark352"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses have been very active during the past year in Sweden. They have been using the Society’s film, carrying on public-meeting work with great success, and their back-calls and Bible studies have increased. They have moved ahead in fine style with the distribution of the magazines. All of this has had a very telling effect on the whole country of Sweden, especially on their spiritual leaders. The clergy of that land are upset now because Jehovah’s witnesses have made good progress. Evidently Jehovah’s witnesses are making more progress than the clergy and the clergy are beginning to put on a campaign to bring the people back to their churches, or to stop the people from going to Jehovah’s witnesses. They can try, but those of the right heart will never leave the city of refuge to take up residence again with false religions. The branch servant has something to say about these conditions and excerpts from his report are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As this report is being prepared the daily papers tell that a joint meeting of twenty clergymen, representing the state church and six other denominations, has been sitting for two days to discuss measures to be taken against Jehovah’s witnesses, whom they consider &quot;a danger to our Christian work,” as the witnesses “go from home to home and spread their doctrine which is not a Christian one.” The number of witnesses in Sweden, they said, has doubled in ten years, which “is a disagreeably rapid increase.” This testimony on their part is really very encouraging, seeing that our increase this past service year has not been so rapid as we should have liked to see. But evidently the effect of the consistent work done by the publishers has really frightened these clerical opponents of Jehovah’s kingdom and his New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the churches are responsible for the people’s lack of Biblical knowledge is sometimes admitted by priests and preachers. The local state-church priest in a parish up in Lapland stated to one of our special pioneers that his work was uncalled for in that parish. As just one example, the priest was then told that a retired lady teacher had stated to the pioneer how much she appreciated that he had called to discuss and study the Bible, which no one had ever done before. And why is it that the people are in such dire need of Bible knowledge? “I suppose it is the fault of the slothful servant in this place,” was the priest’s reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The faithful and loving work among the scattered sheep that is being done also in isolated places by special pioneers is bearing fruit. The pioneer just mentioned and his wife have had the joy of getting a congregation going in less than one year, with eleven reporting, where there was just one lone witness when they arrived. Of these new ones one man travels, even in the dead of winter, fifty-four miles each way on his small motorbicycle in order to attend the meetings. A sample of what can be accomplished in unassigned territory in the way of stirring up interest was told by a circuit servant, who reported how one congregation had arranged to spend the weekend of his visit in their unassigned territory, 109 publishers taking part in this “drive.” Arrangements were made beforehand and meetings held Saturday night and Sunday, with preceding magazine work, street witnessing, calls on every home, both in the town and outlying territory, and an information march with loud-speaker announcement regarding the public lecture. This was held out-of-doors and gathered 340 listeners, 145 of whom attended the study and concluding talk. The local daily gave a splendid report and the visit there was the topic of all conversation all over town. “It was just like a little circuit assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brothers throughout the country have responded very well to the Society’s appeal that magazine work should be stressed. The April 1 issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> with that wonderful message about all mankind’s being made one under their Creator, went “like hot cakes” and set the pace for a very good increase in placements of magazines. It has been a joy to us here at Bethel that we have been able to serve our brothers in Norway with magazines since the beginning of the calendar year, thus utilizing our printing equipment more fully. There is still the nuisance of having some of the family taken away for prison terms of varying lengths, but by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness there have always been substitutes ready who could be called in at short notice and trained to keep the job going.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark353"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Good progress has been made during the service year in Switzerland and a wonderful witness has been given. It is not very often that the radio can be used, but one day the branch office received a letter from a radio manager inviting Jehovah’s witnesses to take part in a discussion with representatives of the Reformed National Church. Reports from one end of the country to the other are to the effect that thousands of people listened to this discussion and as a result many wrote to the branch office saying that Jehovah’s witnesses had won in the discussion. One newspaper had this to say about the program on the radio: “We regret to say that if we had to decide for one or the other party in the debate, we would rather have decided in favor of the representatives of the sect, Jehovah’s witnesses.” The representatives of the Society in the discussion were well armed with the Bible. They quoted scripture and gave a good witness, which was an amazement to the radio audience. Those representing the Society used the Scriptures, to the delight of the radio audience. It is necessary for all of God’s ministers to be well versed in the Bible so that they can preach at any time and anywhere to any people. There are some other very interesting experiences that the branch servant in Switzerland reports on and these are here recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How even small children when properly trained in the Scriptures can have a good understanding of Bible principles is shown by the experiences of an eight-year-old girl in Italian Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day the priest came to school to sell prayer books. When he offered one to the little girl, she politely said: “No thank you.” He wanted to know why not. She boldly answered: “Jesus Christ only taught us one prayer, the Lord’s prayer.” Some time later the priest again visited the class and distributed pictures of saints. After he had asked her the reason for her refusal, she said: “Because the Lord said we should not make and worship images.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then came Christmas. The teacher was rehearsing an interview that was to take place at the National Radio Station, where the children were to give some expressions about Christmas. This young witness was also chosen. The “interview” between the teacher and the girl turned out like this: “Are you glad that we shall soon have Christmas?” “Yes.” “Why are you glad?” “Because we shall have vacation.” “Only for that reason?” “Yes.” “But aren’t you glad that the little baby Jesus will bring you a lot of nice toys?” “No, because Jesus is no longer a baby, but King in heaven, and I know too that Christmas comes from the heathens.” (The teacher decided then that this girl was not suited to talk on the radio about Christmas!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Usually when school is over her father picks her up with his car. One noon she had to wait a bit. It was just election day, so the priest, who happened to pass by, said to her: “It won’t be long; your dad is probably just at the town hall to vote.” “Not likely,” replied the little girl, “because true Christians don’t engage in politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this country we sometimes find it difficult to get half-day secular work to support pioneers. One brother wrote us the following report, which is a good example of proper planning, determination and trust in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“After attending the Triumphant Kingdom assembly in Nuremberg in August, 1955, I did not need to deliberate whether I wanted to be a pioneer or not. After hearing the many encouraging and joyful reports of experienced full-time servants my decision was made and I set May 1,1956, as the date to start. Beginning in February, 1956, I began to look for half-day employment, answering various newspaper advertisements. Twice I advertised myself, but without success. Time passed quickly and May 1 arrived and still I had not found the desired job. What now? Should I change my decision, even, perhaps, while looking for appropriate employment over a longer period of time, losing my ‘Purpose in Life’ from view? No. I began my pioneer service, using half days in the preaching work and spending the rest of the day looking for work. How did I do it? I simply went from one firm to another explaining the reason for my unusual visit. In this way I called on seventy to eighty firms, and at last one businessman was ready to take me on. On May 22 I could start work at the job that now enables me to keep on in the full-time service. I have already experienced much joy in the few weeks that I have spent in the pioneer service, and I deeply appreciate this privilege, and perhaps all the more because I had to fight for it. I am determined to remain in the pioneer service as long as Jehovah so wills.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark354"></a>THAILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The ministers in the New World society in Thailand have advanced to greater maturity. More and more the publishers are putting forth an effort to use Bible sermons in the house-to-house preaching. This has become very effective. A number of the ministers there have shown their maturity by taking up pioneer service, and others were appointed to the special pioneer activity. Some of the isolated sections of Thailand are being witnessed to and we hope that during the year 1957 more such territories will be visited and worked by special pioneers. One special pioneer developed a congregation of thirty-four publishers. This was accomplished in a period of just two years’ time. Surely such things must be a great comfort to the special pioneer himself. What a reward for faithfulness! The branch servant sets out some very interesting experiences of what is being done in Thailand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The outstanding event of the year was the visit of our dear Brothers Knorr and Adams. How everyone looked forward to your coming! Since most of the brothers live in the northern part of Thailand, Brother Knorr’s desire was to hold the assembly in Chiengmai. This arrangement was very successful, for 80 percent of our brothers were able to attend. For some it was the first opportunity to hear and meet Brother Knorr. The well-advertised lecture “Making All Mankind One Under Their Creator” was given to an audience of 348. Some of those who attended the lecture turned in their names to the ushers, asking to have Jehovah’s witnesses call on them to explain more about the New World. Especially appreciated by the brothers was the talk given by Brother Knorr the following day about the persecution Jehovah’s witnesses receive in Russia and that the brothers were holding on tenaciously to their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another noteworthy event during the service year was the arrival of ten graduates of Gilead who were assigned to take up their missionary duties here. By their taking every opportunity to preach in season and out of season the following experience was enjoyed by the missionaries while on their way to Thailand. “On the way to our assignment, being the only four passengers on board, we had a wonderful opportunity to witness to members of the crew on the snip. At first the crew members showed no respect for the Kingdom message, thinking we were like other religious missionaries. The chief engineer, while listening to the message, was quite dubious of us, but how quickly he changed! Within a short time he became our best friend. The more he listened to the good news the more he wanted to spend all of his spare time with us, and his interest grew by leaps and bounds. When we arrived at Manila arrangements were made to show on board ship the film ‘The New World Society in Action.’ Before going to bed that night the chief engineer declared that this had been the best day in his life, and for many days afterward he repeated: ‘I cannot get over it, so many happy people; I thought it would never be possible to find people like this.’ A short time ago we received a letter from him telling his joy in further studying the truth. Now he has a complete library of theocratic literature on board ship. In his letter he stated to us that he had set aside time for study every night. Even though ridiculed by some of the crew members he wrote: 'I have lost many of my friends, but how happy I am now that I know who my real friends are, and by thinking of our hope for the New World I have been able to stand this.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who engage in the treasure of full-time service continue to have many joyful experiences to relate. From one of the missionaries comes this experience: “While going from house to house we met a shopkeeper who professed the Buddhist religion. This woman accepted a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, but commented that she was not interested. Nevertheless, arrangements were made to call back to see if she had perhaps read some of the magazine. It was found she had not only read some but had read it completely. So absorbed in the message was she that she asked us to call on her every week so she could learn more of this strange religion, as she called it. As her interest grew quickly, our next call was a Bible study. When we were ready to leave we said we could call again in one week; however, we soon found out that she was not satisfied. She wanted two visits a week, so hungry was she for the truth. As the study progressed she was not satisfied with one hour; now she wanted to study two hours at each visit. Every time some new point was brought out in the course of our study this good-will person would exclaim: ‘Why didn’t you tell me that before!’ When the appointed time came for her study she would refuse to sell any goods to her customers, bidding them to go to the next shop, for she had something more important to do. Truly this was a manifestation of great interest, when one takes into consideration that her livelihood depended on the few sales she made during the day. The more she studied the more she practiced the true religion and cast off the false. The first step along this line was the cutting down of the holy tree she had planted next to her shop. Every day as customers came to her shop she would tell them what she had learned during the studies and none escaped without hearing something about the Kingdom. Just five months after the first call this good-will person was immersed during the circuit servant’s visit. Now she attends all the congregational meetings and takes part in all preaching activities.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark355"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The branch office for a group of islands in the Caribbean Sea is located at Trinidad. This group of islands was hit by the hurricane “Janet” and much damage was done on a number of them, but it is gratifying to know that a number of our brothers in Trinidad sent much needed help for those suffering. The increase has not been as great this year as might be expected; however, there are some very bright spots on the report even though the hurricane hit this group of islands. There are many problems to contend with, but the New World society faces them head on and meets such problems because they know that this good news of the Kingdom must be preached. The office in Trinidad looks after a group of islands, each named as follows: Barbados, Bequia, Carria-cou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Tobago and Trinidad. Experiences have been reported from each of these places and some of them are printed herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After a preliminary survey, an appeal for used clothing and donations was launched by the branch office in Trinidad. Our objective was to keep on with the Kingdom proclamation with temporary aid till more permanent government help was forthcoming. God must love the Trinidad brothers, for Paul said: “God loves a cheerful giver.” They cheerfully gave from whatever they had and it is with humble pride we are glad to report that 4,600 pounds of used clothing, thirty-six large packing cases, were donated in one week! In addition, relief donations of money were received at the office totaling $1,646.55 B.W.I. This was sufficient to take care of our needs without taking advantage of offers of help from brothers in other lands. Truly Paul’s words of the first century are appropriate: “In everything you are being enriched for every kind of generosity, which produces through us an expression of thanks to God; because the ministry of this public service is not only to supply abundantly the wants of the holy ones but also to be rich with many expressions of thanks to God.”—2 Cor. 9:7, 11, 12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One congregation servant has reported success in magazine distribution. “We have found that by taking note of when various pay days come up on the different estates and working the area that weekend our magazine placements almost double.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark356"></a>BARBADOS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Assemblies in Barbados are always enthusiastic and well supported. For the past few years we have been holding our assemblies in the country districts with exceptionally good results. Formerly we held to the idea that assemblies could only be held in Bridgetown, the island’s only city of some 15,000 persons. But these country assemblies, especially the outdoor ones, have far surpassed anything we had imagined. At Speights-town, a small fishing community, the attendance at the public lecture was over 1,000 in spite of inclement weather. More persons of good will attended than there are publishers for the whole island, indicating there is much potential for increase, if the servants and brothers in general will organize for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEQUIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark357"></a><span class="font3">Bequia is a pretty little island of the Grenadines group and is administered by the St. Vincent government. It is the second-largest of the Grenadines, with about 5,000 inhabitants. They are very friendly people, who have welcomed the missionary boat Light in its many visits during the past several years. The ministrations of the crew of the boat have developed much interest and persons of good will have manifested themselves. Occasional reports of field activity are received, and one or two regular studies have been held by some of the interested. In August permission was granted for two special pioneer sisters to enter the island, and we are looking forward to seeing the interest organized for regular field activity. The film “The New World Society in Action” has been shown here three times, each time to audiences over 500 in number. The enthusiastic reception given each time gives good indication that some “other sheep” will be taking their stand shortly, and we are looking forward to having them join with the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark358"></a>CARRIACOU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The only electricity available on these Islands is by privately owned diesel generators. This did not handicap the brothers in showing the film “The New World Society in Action” on four of the islands where motion pictures are practically unknown. By backing the Society’s boat as close in to shore as the ground swell would permit and running a cable ashore to the beach, the boat’s generator was able to provide electricity and the film was projected onto the side of a house of some good-will person. In this manner enthusiastic appreciation was shown by large audiences three times on Bequia, once on Cannouan, three times on Carriacou and three times on Union Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to the relief clothing brought by the Light to Carriacou from Puerto Rico the brothers in Trinidad were overjoyed to send seven packing cases containing 600 pounds of used clothing to their distressed brothers in Carriacou. In addition they were happy to contribute $192.00 B.W.I. to their relief. The brothers there responded during the balance of the year with a 71.4-percent average increase of publishers and a 52-percent peak increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark359"></a>GRENADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Hurricane Janet crossed squarely over the northern half of the island, creating havoc and leaving the countryside a shambles. Again the brothers were severely affected, though none lost their lives. It was many weeks before road communications were re-established, as debris from floods littered everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Assemblies held out in the smaller communities have proved to be beneficial for all concerned. Grenville on the windward coast was thus favored and many opened their homes to the witnesses, many of whom came from neighboring islands. “The people around the assembly site were very friendly,” wrote the circuit servant. “Not one charged anything for the rooms the publishers used. Many publishers have reported that householders insisted on preparing breakfast for them before they attended the assembly. One shopkeeper moved himself to his shop downstairs and turned all the rooms over his shop over to the rooming department for the use of the brothers. He refused any payment, saying he would not think of taking anything from ‘real Christians.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark360"></a>ST. LUCIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Friendliness when used tactfully can calm even dangerous opposers. A native brother approached the home of a fanatic Catholic, who had never permitted a witness to talk to her. “Do not come here,” the woman angrily shouted, “you all are deceivers and liars.” Ignoring her words he continued toward the house, so she grabbed a cutlass and rushed at him. Observing her intentions, he quickly said: “Madam, I have been walking all morning through the heat of the sun, and I am only calling to get a little water to quench my thirst.” She stopped in front of him and said: “Well, if that is all you need, you may have some water, but I don’t want to hear one word of your nonsense.” The brother was so “thirsty” that he took half an hour to drink the glass of water so as to talk to the woman on local events. He spoke about the high cost of living, comparing it with God’s promises. Then they discussed what one must do to gain the approval of God, not Jehovah. The woman became friendly and to the amazement of her friends invited him to call again. Now whenever he is in that district she prepares food for him. A “cup of cold water” will not be forgotten for this person who may be one of the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been possible to send special pioneers to three communities on the island beside the main city of Castries. Language is a barrier here because most of the natives in the country districts speak patois, an unwritten mixture of Spanish, French and English. Selecting native publishers of St. Lucia to be special pioneers has helped solve this, as they can speak and understand this native dialect. In Vieux Fort, at the south of the island, the special pioneers proudly report five isolated publishers with regularly attended meetings and studies. Patient cultivating is paying dividends, as opposition is not so severe now and many more listen, but are still afraid.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark361"></a>ST. VINCENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This island’s economy is basically agricultural, which is not too diversified. The people are poverty-stricken. The main crop is arrowroot, which is cultivated by planting it on terraces cut in the steep sides of the mountains. All this is done by hand with heavy hoes and the people work from daylight to dark for a small pittance. Because of this the standard of living is so low that many are unable to make sufficient money to feed themselves and their families with enough nourishment to sustain their strength to enable them to work. So it is hard for them to lift up their eyes and see beyond the hard, grinding toil the beauty of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The circuit servant reports this island as the problem child of the territory. “Looking beyond the present condition there is still a possibility for increase, as there is much interest on the island,” he writes. There is need for firm and vigorous leadership, as most of the publishers are willing but lack ability. The training program is not of much help presently, as there are few among them sufficiently literate to train others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark362"></a>TOBAGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The special pioneers in Tobago continue to render a really splendid example of the Christian ministry as they average over 200 hours in the field every month of the year. It is because of their persistently and lovingly rendering aid to the &quot;other sheep” that a substantial increase is reported. They conducted an average of twenty Bible studies each every month in addition to looking after all congregational meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Economically Tobago is poor and is on the same level as most other West Indian islands. Illiteracy is high and money is scarce to the average person. However, there is a big difference in one respect here from other islands and that is with respect to the splendid magazine distribution achieved by the special pioneers. They managed to distribute an average of 122 magazines each every month during the year, for the highest average of all specials on the islands. If they are able by persistent effort to do this there is no reason why others cannot do likewise.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark363"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Excellent results were achieved in Uruguay during the past twelve months. Theocratic joy increased and the brothers have had very interesting experiences as they have improved their service in this part of the world. The branch servant reports that the quality of the sermons the brothers use now is greatly advanced. This shows that they are becoming more mature, and this is fine. They have concentrated on the training program and the results are manifest because 147 people were baptized in Uruguay during the year. In many places, in order for the people to get their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazines, the brothers must make personal delivery because they cannot always depend on the post office. This has been to the advantage of the organization, for it has given the brothers opportunities to start new studies. Going back every two weeks allows them to say a little more about the truth, and thus some have turned </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers into fine Bible studies. The branch servant reports on Uruguay and the Falkland Islands, where we send a brother each year to help the people in that isolated place, and the experiences are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several native special pioneers went into isolated assignments after a brief special training course based mostly on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Qualified to Be Ministers.</span><span class="font3"> The value of this training soon manifested itself, as one special pioneer told a circuit servant: “You have no idea how badly we needed that instruction. As a result we don’t ‘mother’ the good will in such a way that they remain ‘babes’ indefinitely, but we help them advance to maturity more rapidly. We start our studies thinking about service almost from the very first call, and invite them to go with us at the earliest possible moment. It’s wonderful to see these good-will persons advance by listening to our sermons in the service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Four special pioneers sent to one town a year ago have already produced a congregation of ten publishers and have twenty attending meetings. Two others began a year ago and now report twelve publishers in their new congregation and twenty regularly attending meetings. Another Uruguayan couple with their son were assigned to help a congregation and within three months the attendance rose from thirty to eighty, and it continues to grow with a corresponding increase in publishers. Missionaries worked there previously but native pioneers get better results with their own people. The brothers co-operate splendidly to maintain their own hall and support all features of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A lively well-prepared sermon is indispensable in comforting discouraged and forlorn persons. One woman could not conceive how “God is love,” since she suffered so much and saw much misery; but the interesting, persuasive sermon of an alert witness caused her to welcome a back-call where more impressive proofs cheered up her disposition. Then a study was started with her and her two daughters in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”.</span><span class="font3"> The whole family are now ardent Bible students, with the mother in the lead. They already discuss Bible truths with neighbors and invite them to study, thus appreciating the importance of sharing their joy with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Imagine the conscience-smitten feeling of this missionary who writes: “A lady was visiting the home where I have a study, and said she previously studied with a missionary who left and would like me to continue with her. I had other calls I thought were more interested. Months later I called at her home while doing house-to-house work and placed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’.</span><span class="font3"> Some weeks later I returned and started a study in this booklet. When we studied about ‘Dedication’ imagine my joy when she expressed her desire to be baptized and participate in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What made me feel guilty was her adding: ‘What a shame I have wasted so much time when I could have been studying all these months. If you had come and taught me after that other girl left I should already have enough knowledge to go out with you and preach.’ ” Her husband also participates in the study and wants to be baptized, because he realizes that his previous religious baptism is not valid before Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In one frontier town where immorality is almost everybody’s business and hobby, a special pioneer sister was puzzled as to why she was always followed by a policeman into one home where she studied with a woman. Finally one day the woman explained that she ran a small brothel with hired girls, as her only means of livelihood. Her conscience was not entirely clear, but now she was getting an unmistakably plain understanding of Jehovah’s laws and purposes. The study continued and she progressed in knowledge to the point that she planned to clean house and prepare for New World living. “One day when I arrived,” the pioneer writes, “imagine my joy when she greeted me with a big hug and proudly announced that she was now clean.” She dismissed the hired girls, repainted the building, no more policemen watched her home, and she now earns her living by running a small lunch stand. With happy tears she begged: “Today we must give extra thanks to Jehovah, as I am now a clean, honest working girl.” What a thrill it is to see Jehovah’s spirit make such changes in the lives of meek, honest-hearted people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark364"></a>FALKLAND ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Early in February one lone missionary was a passenger on the small freighter that left Montevideo and plowed through the choppy waters due south to the Falkland Islands. After a five-day journey he reached the island’s only city of about 1,000 population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His first desire was to locate all the persons who had studied or shown interest in the truth on the two previous visits of missionaries. One isolated publisher helped the missionary find the scattered sheep, and arrangements were made to re-establish many Bible studies. The house-to-house work also yielded some new studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since false religion is very deeply entrenched in the minds of the people it was necessary to give particular attention to strengthening the interested ones in the basic truths. So as to withstand the fiery attacks of the enemy unwaveringly they needed stronger armor and better equipment with which to fight back aggressively. Thus a thorough review of all basic doctrinal teachings of the Scriptures was necessary. Their knowledge increased, appreciation deepened, and they began using theocratic expressions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark365"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle Paul was always anxious to give good counsel to the ministers of the good news. He said: “Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.’’ (1 Cor. 15: 58, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> This counsel applies to all of Jehovah’s people everywhere and those in Venezuela are certainly taking heed to these good words. The New World society in Venezuela has had plenty to do in this vast country, but they have by no means covered it. There are still many villages and towns of up to five and ten thousand in population that have never been covered with the preaching witnesses of Jehovah and their good news of the Kingdom. However, year by year the witnesses increase in numbers of publishers proclaiming the good news, and it will not be long before many of these will enter the special pioneer work and get out into isolated places. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A busy publisher from Barquisimeto writes this experience: ’‘One day while I was doing street work, a lady, beside whose place of business I was standing, approached me with a slip of paper with the name and address of a person who wanted one of Jehovah’s witnesses to visit him. When a fellow missionary called the young man was not home, so the missionary left the invitation to come to the Kingdom Hall, which is also the address of the missionary home. A few days later the young man called at the missionary home and made arrangements for a definite time to visit him. The other missionary and I went at the appointed time and then and there began a study in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font3"> The young man was so interested that a study in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> was also begun with him, as he works at a theater and cannot get to the meetings. One week I was not able to go for the study, and the next day he came to the missionary home to inquire what had happened. Since the very beginning he has been talking to all his friends and family, and today, after only seven studies in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font3"> and three in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> he joined our Sunday morning group and went with us from house to house. Certainly in this time of the harvest Jehovah is giving the increase, but we too must do our part, knowing that we have plenty to do in the work of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Actually, Venezuelans are quick to participate in the service and promptly make a decision about the truth. Recently, at a circuit assembly a lady, presumedly a sister, was standing by herself crying. The district servant’s wife stepped over to ask what was wrong and offered to help her. The woman explained that she had wanted to get baptized, but that they told her to wait till the next time. The witness, thinking this strange, asked the woman how long she had been studying the Bible and the woman said just a couple of weeks in the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”.</span><span class="font3"> The district servant’s wife tried to comfort her with the knowledge that the next time she would be more mature with experience in the service by then and would really understand better the step she was taking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the congregation where this woman attends there are four group contact points a week. The next Tuesday morning there she was, ready to go in the service. In two weeks she had her own witnessing bag and literature and now, five months later, she is still attending all the contact points, being one of the best publishers in this area. She is happily awaiting the next circuit assembly to be baptized.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark366"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has blessed the devoted people of this country in their efforts to share in the work of gathering the other sheep. Good progress has been made in this respect. The brothers have a difficult time in meeting people of good will because they may not engage in house-to-house work legally, as this is forbidden by the government. However, they do seek many opportunities to speak to other people, and in some sections of the land everyone knows about Jehovah’s witnesses. Then again there are wide sections of territory where the truth is not known. So we cannot relax our hand in spreading out and reaching other parts of the country with the message of God. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences concerning the work in Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The question of meeting places is still the most difficult problem in this country. Many congregations have no hall, and as it is strictly forbidden by law to meet in private homes, a regular study is a very difficult problem for them, requiring an urgent solution. The problem of acquiring property of our own in Belgrade to house the branch office found a favorable solution in the course of the year, in that the president of the Society sent financial help from America, which allowed us to purchase a house in which we have established the branch office and which contains also the Kingdom Hall of the Belgrade congregation and modest living quarters. For this we are deeply grateful to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following experiences will no doubt be of interest to you. On the occasion of a baptismal service, when the candidates stood ready in their bathing costumes to be immersed, one of them, an elderly woman, approached another candidate, a man of about thirty years, with the words: “We know each other, don’t we?” Joyfully surprised, the young man warmly embraced her. After the immersion the brother in charge wished to know the reason for this cordial greeting. He was told that the young man had studied to become a Catholic priest and that shortly before he celebrated his first mass he met an Adventist who drew his attention to various false doctrines of the Catholic Church. This priest-to-be thereupon joined the Adventists. But soon he became aware of the sanctimoniousness of this sect, especially of the material side of it as regards the “tenth,” and in great despair he left it. And now, rejected by his relatives for having abandoned the church that claims the monopoly of “all means of grace” and with his faith in the Adventists shaken, one day he sat in a park brooding over the corruption of mankind when a woman sat down beside him. She read a little booklet and started to discuss its contents with him. It was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love.</span><span class="font3"> The publisher gave him the booklet, he left, and they did not see each other again till they met to be immersed. But he wrote to the address found in the booklet and got in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses, attended their meetings regularly, grew in the knowledge of the truth and decided to dedicate himself to Jehovah, which he desired to symbolize by water immersion. And here he was now to do it. Suddenly this woman who had given him the booklet stood before him, and she wanted to be immersed too, because in the meantime she had made progress in the truth and had dedicated herself to Jehovah. Their joy was abounding when they found they both wanted to walk in the way leading to life everlasting in the New World. They are now both zealous publishers in the same congregation.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark367"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark368"></a>THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN WERE OPENED</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">Throughout the year 1956 in all Kingdom Halls of the world there was prominently displayed before all of us the scripture set forth at Malachi 3:10, “Prove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing.” In practically all homes of Jehovah’s witnesses a calendar with this text continually reminded them that Jehovah is a God of blessing and that it is our opportunity to prove Jehovah as to his faithfulness in promises. Now that another service year of Jehovah’s witnesses has closed there is abundant evidence that Jehovah God actually has poured out a blessing far greater than could be contained. Very richly blessed have been all those associated with the New World society who have brought into His storehouse the things due Jehovah. At the close of 1956 Jehovah’s witnesses are a happy people. They have seen many new faces in their midst. Many other sheep have been gathered. A great witness has been given to the ends of the earth, because their “held is the world.” (Matt. 13:38, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font3"> They have not slacked their hand in trying to disciple peoples of all national groups; but they have kept clearly in mind the words of Jesus: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” They realize that they have been faithful to keep this command for one more year. —Matt. 28:19, 20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah may be pleased to show us that he desires us to continue preaching this good news for years ahead. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and with his complete protection those of the New World society happily will continue to preach. As a people conscious that they are living in the last days of the devilish organization of Satan, and its United Nations, that detestable “disgusting thing that causes desolation,” Jehovah’s witnesses now can review their work and feel satisfied. Reports have been received at the Brooklyn headquarters from 162 countries, islands and provinces, stating that Jehovah’s witnesses have gone forward proclaiming the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom. They are able to say that now there regularly are more publishers in the field every month than ever before, 591,556; and that is quite a group of witnesses! Of this number, 16,783 are in full-time witnessing work, either as pioneers, special pioneers, missionaries, or circuit servants or district servants. And to those we can add 1,099 more individuals who are devoting their lives wholly to Jehovah’s service in the branch offices. Yes, more than 17,800 are fulltime workers in Jehovah’s vineyard. Many others can be used, for the field is great; and there still are some parts of earth where the Kingdom good news never has been preached. In some countries there are cities to which Jehovah’s witnesses never have gone to give the Kingdom message. Just how far does Jehovah God want us to go with this preaching of his good news? It is a challenge to all who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah to push on as never before. We feel sure that everyone who has engaged in preaching the good news during these momentous times has had great joy and a real satisfaction in knowing that he has been doing the right work, that which Jehovah wants done at this time, and which the living God has declared in his Word will be done before the end of this system of things comes by his own direct action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It may be that during the 1957 service year many congregation publishers will find ways and means to become vacation pioneers. Others may enter the pioneer service and eventually become special pioneers and prepare themselves for greater privileges, such as circuit and district service or co-operating in branch-office activity or going off into missionary fields. We rejoice that 1,905 of those who have graduated from Gilead still are in full-time service. A number of them are branch servants, others of them work in Bethel homes or as missionaries, opening up new territories. Their lives are an endless song, rich with good works. Some have chosen to step aside from this attractive field, too, and have returned home to settle down, to live life quietly; and they have stopped their full-time activity. Many of these one-time missionaries even become lax as good congregation publishers, and sometimes they try to justify themselves by speaking disparagingly about missionary service. Is this not fighting against God? When some good reason arises and a person actually cannot continue in full-time ministry, he does not have to make excuses and try to convince others that they should not continue in that work. Rather, the joy of all God’s people is to see the great witness given concerning Jehovah’s established kingdom and to have a personal share in the continuing proclamation; and this they know must be done to the extremities of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only do we find joy and satisfaction in what we individually do, but we gain great joy out of the cumulative results; and great joy is ours in knowing what others have been doing. In reading this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font3">satisfaction is ours, because with others we have shared in giving to Jehovah our exclusive devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will interest readers of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> to know of the numerous printing plants the Society has established in various parts of the world. Of course, Brooklyn has the largest of the Society’s printing plants and we have recently finished a large structure called the Watchtower Building, the new home of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> magazines. In Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Brazil and South Africa there also are major printing plants; and shortly we expect to expand by putting up structures in Denmark and Holland. In many of the branches we do small printing, not including books, booklets and magazines. It makes our hearts glad to see that at the close of the year 108,606,757 magazines were produced in all of our printing plants. This means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> have had the widest circulation they have ever had in any one year. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> leads, with a printing total of 63,515,372. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font3"> finished the year with a total printing of 45,091,385. These magazines have brought great comfort to readers, and this often has been shown in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> reports. In addition to this big feaure of bringing printed-magazine sermons to the people, we distributed also 22,385,605 Bibles, bound books and booklets, not to mention millions of tracts and handbills that have been distributed unceasingly everywhere in all languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking back over the years since 1921, it is of interest to note that out of the Brooklyn plant alone more than one and a quarter billion Bibles, books, pamphlets and magazines have gone forth to comfort the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has helped earnestly in getting the good news preached in other lands through direct financial aid. More than $760,000 was sent to branches to help with expense. Additionally, to all parts of the world has gone literature for which there has been no return in the form of financial payment. The Society is very grateful to all of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth for their generous contributions; and here again they </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font3"> been bringing their gifts into the storehouse, for effective use by Jehovah’s organization. Were it not for the unceasing generosity of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere we should not be able to carry on this great expansion work nor pay for paper, ink, machinery, buildings; nor could we finance missionaries and special pioneers, circuit and district work in all parts of earth. It is out of the goodness of the hearts of Jehovah’s witnesses that the Society is able to continue to operate and carry on the grand expansion program, which it has had pleasure in pursuing, and which it plans to carry forward during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Expressions of appreciation from all sections of the world come to the president’s office, saying: “Will you please tell our brothers that we love them and that we appreciate their goodness to us in so many respects.” It gives me great joy to convey, by means of this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font3"> such expressions of love and greetings of your brothers far and wide to you and, in turn, your love to them. The unity and oneness of Jehovah’s people in this strife-torn earth of today proves that they indeed are a New World society under the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah, and his enthroned, unconquerable King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now we are entering a new year on the world’s calendar, 1957. With confidence, with genuine joy, we look to Jehovah to guide our continuing united activity during this year, and for his bountiful blessing. With fear-free, humble and steadfast hearts we shall keep on praising him and “from day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.”—Ps. 96: 2, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother and fellow servant who is very happy with you in serving the happy God, Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">, President</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp;&nbsp;TRACT SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark369"></a><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark370"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">On October 1, 1956, the main hall of the Society’s headquarters in Pittsburgh was packed with 751 happy visitors, and this at ten o’clock in the morning. The reason? It was the annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania and again time to elect some directors. Reports were given of the progress of the work of Jehovah’s organization and the president of the Society gave a discourse on some of the material appearing in the beginning of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few days later the board of directors, meeting in the president’s office in New York city, elected N. H. Knorr as president, F. W. Franz as vicepresident, Grant Suiter as secretary-treasurer, and H. H. Riemer as assistant secretary-treasurer. The other members of the board of directors are T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle and M. G. Henschel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At their board meeting they expressed their joy in having the opportunity of serving as overseers within the organization, and declared themselves that by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they continually would faithfully perform all privileges of service given to them. They do appreciate Jehovah’s rich blessing upon his New World society and the prosperity that he has brought to all of them as they work together in unity. Unitedly and individually they pray to Jehovah God that his spirit may rest upon them and upon Jehovah’s people everywhere, to the end that Jehovah’s name always will be praised and that all men of good will may come to know that exclusive devotion should be given now to the Sovereign Ruler of the universe. It is the determination of the Watch Tower Society to push on with greater effort.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark371"></a><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark372"></a>Yeartext for 1957</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.”—Ps. 96: 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God has spoken so many good things to us. No matter where we turn to in his Word we find counsel, admonition and encouraging sayings that help us to press on daily in praising our Sovereign Lord, Jehovah. For 1957 the Society has selected a text and when one meditates on this text one at once sees many things without even delving more deeply to get the idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man knows that he needs salvation. Here in this one text from God’s Word we find great strength by recognizing that salvation is by him. So “a great crowd ... out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb,” joyously keeps on loudly emphasizing! (Rev. 7: 9, 10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font3">It is our Creator who makes provision for our life. It is he who provided his Son, Christ Jesus, and sent him into the world. Jehovah, then, is our Savior, for he has made all arrangements for our redemption. It is because of his undeserved kindness that we have the opportunity of living, not just now for a few short years—which even now under increasingly difficult, critical conditions is a pleasure and joy—but his assurance to us is that to those loving him he will give life to time indefinite. Yes, salvation is by him, our God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses do not look at this text from a selfish viewpoint, that it is just “me” he will save. No, but they understand this is genuinely good news for every person of good will; and now that Jehovah’s witnesses have found out about this good news and know of the salvation by Jehovah they are determined not to keep it to themselves. They will tell this good news everywhere, “in favorable season, in troublesome season.” Furthermore, when Jehovah had this text recorded for us he made clear the exuberance and joy that these people show who have this good news to tell.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark373"></a><span class="font3">They are going to show it from day to day, because every day they are going to tell the good news of salvation by him to everyone they possibly can and unto the ends of the earth, as far as they can reach. So it is that during 1957 Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to be a happy people. They will be happy because they know so much about their God; for he continues to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">292 </span><span class="font3">reveal himself and his purposes more and more as days pass. And they are not going to be selfish, not hold to themselves the knowledge of him that they possess, but they are going to tell their neighbors, their relatives, their friends. They are going to do as Jesus did, go from house to house; and, as the faithful apostles of Jesus did, making back-calls and conducting Bible studies with interested persons in their homes. They will do this not only once a month or once a year, but from day to day they are going to tell this good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How wonderful it is that Jehovah God has given us the power to speak, for in that way we can praise him with our lips, in the hearing of the meek ones! (Ps. 34: 1-3) Honored people are we—honored in that we are his special representatives, his witnesses; honored in that he has shown us his salvation and has gathered all of us together into his New World society. Now, as a great army of his people, we unitedly move forward day by day proclaiming this good news of his established kingdom, which has brought joy and happiness to our lives and which we can pour out to bring joy and happiness to the lives of others. Who can refrain? Who can hold back? Not those who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah, not those who know this good news of salvation by him. No, these must tell it from day to day, every day. Every morning of the year we have the opportunity of reading a new text taken from somewhere in Jehovah’s great storehouse of true knowledge; and as we read each daily text we shall think, too, of our text for the year. How good it is of Jehovah to put a responsibility upon us; for he says, “From day to day tell the good news.” Yes, it is his command and, as ministers of his, Kingdom ministers, and being obedient slaves of his, and saying: 'All commandments you have spoken, these we will do,’ we actually will go out and tell the good news of salvation by him. His commission to us we joyfully and gladly accept, continuously and regularly praying to him that he will give us strength and courage and faith to do this great work, his strange work, that must be done in 1957 and just as much longer as Jehovah God wants us to tell the good news of salvation by him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 16:26, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you happen to be a dedicated servant of God serving part time and you are free of obligations, or could be free of them, why have you not made the treasure of full-time service yours? Do you serve Jehovah out of love or for selfish reasons, as Satan charges? Do you hold back because you find no delight in doing God’s will all the time? Remember, lasting enjoyment and true satisfaction come to those who serve the Giver of every good and perfect gift full time. Here is a glorious treasure exceeding by far anything else upon which you might set your heart. It is a treasure that can bring eternal life. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that you should have the proper evaluation of it. You should see it in the right perspective. You should understand the reasons why it is invaluable. By gaining accurate knowledge about it you will develop a mental attitude that Jehovah meant for us to have toward his service. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 22a; 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that hope in Jehovah.—Ps. 31: 26,</span><span class="font0"> AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since God is searching only for those who are of good heart condition, it is vitally necessary that we become strong-hearted for him in our motives and love. It is only by allowing the seeds of truth that enter our minds as we study God’s Word to be absorbed down deep into the “right kind of soil” of our affections or hearts that the strengthening takes place and that an abundance of righteous fruitage of the spirit can be produced. Upon that righteous foundation of collected spiritual treasures let us develop also a heart acceptance of right principles. Not only words of truth but experiences in the service and also trials of integrity create lasting impressions upon the mind. The effect of this strengthens one’s heart immeasurably. The longer one serves as a faithful, dedicated servant and keeps up with the truth, the more stouthearted he becomes as a valiant fighter for Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ex. 5: 9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah, the living God, is the Maker of man and of the earth upon which man lives. He has the right to demand exclusive devotion. “Devotion” means an eager inclination or a strong attachment; an ardent love or affection for one. Devotion has to do with one’s religiousness. Today one who understands true religion carries on genuine worship, even as Jesus predicted: “Genuine worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for such kind to worship him.” (John 4: 23, NW) Anyone giving Jehovah God exclusive devotion will not allow anything else to break into that devotion or to mar it. Jehovah cannot tolerate it; therefore the individual should not let anything interfere. One’s devotion to Jehovah must be filled with love. It must be an ardent love, a single love to Jehovah God— not a love that can be divided with someone else. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 1; 11a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.—Isa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">46:9, 10, A.S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of all persons in the universe the great God Jehovah himself has the widest range of vital interests. The pursuing of his multitudinous interests brings him immense delight. These divine interests are made clear in the expressions of his divine will and are evident in the purposes he sets out. All his interests are executed in a good way, never carried out in a course of badness. Upon the completion of his gigantic interests of creation the record reads that “it was very good.” Of his absolute goodness Jesus testified: “Nobody is good, except one, God.” (Mark 10:18, A<sup>T</sup>W) For this reason God’s goodness always brings him a record of merit that in turn yields the reward of happiness and exhilarating refreshment. It is because of this that he is called “the happy God.” —1 Tim. 1: 11, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW. W 1/15 7,</span><span class="font0"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">He entered, no, not with the blood of goats and of young bulls, but with his own blood, once for all time into the holy place and obtained an everlasting release for us.—Heb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">9: 13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the inaugurating of the old law covenant there were burnt offerings and communion offerings, which latter, Paul shows, included goats. This means that not only did Jehovah get the fat, but also the priests got the right leg and shoulder of them, and, if the priests did not get all the rest, Israel’s representatives, the “seventy of the older men of Israel,” ate the rest. Thus all Israel, by means of its priests and its representative men, had communion with Jehovah at his altar when the old law covenant was inaugurated. The blood of all those bulls and goats slaughtered there at Mount Sinai pictured the blood of Jesus, the mediator of Jehovah’s new covenant, for the blood of those animals was mixed together in bowls and was then sprinkled upon the law book and people. Jesus died sacrificially to provide this blood. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 23, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his</span><span class="font0"> [God’s J </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 6:33, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Seeking first the kingdom of God demands of one exclusive devotion to Him. The now-established kingdom of God vindicates Jehovah’s name and word. Its first act was to cast the Devil from his position of rival in heaven. Now Satan and his invisible hordes can operate only in earth’s vicinity. Here, too, their ousting is due. Here, too, the issue of sovereignty or unrivaled rulership Jehovah's now-established kingdom will settle. “I Jehovah your God am a God not tolerating rivalry.” Jehovah will not give his glory to any other person. His principles of truth and righteousness will be carried out. From now on, in the mind of every living creature, his identity as the Supreme Sovereign and his name Jehovah must stand alone! “You must not bow down to another god, because Jehovah is exclusively devoted to his name. He is a God exacting exclusive devotion.”—Ex. 34: 14, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font0">IV. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah hath anointed me to pi each good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.—Isa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">61:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Just as Gideon’s men broke open the pitchers they held to let their torches shine brightly to the consternation of the enemy, so Jehovah’s servants in the earth are letting the light of truth be seen from the darkest corner of Christendom to the darkest corner of pagandom. And that which brings them the greatest joy is the releasing of the prisoners, the proclaiming of liberty to the captives and the opening of the prisons to those who are bound. This is done by patiently teaching the truth to men of good will, gradually pulling aside the veil of superstition and religious darkness, to which I hey have been accustomed from childhood. When they are finally freed through a knowledge of the truth, their joy is as great as that of a captive who is liberated or as that of a blind man to whom sight is restored. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 5, 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those in accord with the spirit on the things of the spirit. For the minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 8:5, 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the mind we reason on the acquired information and come to certain definite conclusions. When these conclusions are reached we are enabled to make intelligent decisions. Paul called upon all the Corinthian brothers to come to the same knowledge of the truth, which would lead them to united right thinking. (1 Cor. 1:10) If one thinks wrongly on things of the fallen flesh, wrong desires are aroused that influence one’s course downward. Following wrong desires and faulty determinations over a period of time we thereby form a set design of decisions or a pattern of determinations. This entire pattern of conclusions governing our conduct may be so far off the beam of right conduct that a radical about-face of conduct is required, as well as an entire new pattern of thinking to make one over into a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font0">personality. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">against you.—Deut. 7:3, 4, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Parents should teach their children proper conduct toward the opposite sex and respect for Jehovah’s moral code. And when children begin to think of marriage the parents should again properly fill the role of instructor so the son or the daughter will understand what is required in the proper selection of a mate. Jehovah’s rules on this matter are clear, beginning with what makes one fit for marriage. Parents should be just as concerned as was Abraham when he selected a wife for his son Isaac. And children should be as respectful as was Isaac toward his Godfearing father. Paul likewise counsels: ‘Marry only in the Lord.’ IIow can separateness from the world be maintained when one selects a mate from the world and then lives as intimately with that one as do husband and wife? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Paul saw each Christian as a contestant in the issue of man’s keeping integrity to Jehovah and with the prize of eternal life held out to him. The aspiring Greek athletes in his day dedicated their whole lives to gaining the prize. Before they came to the stadium they regularly performed feats as difficult as those in the contest. They did not get their beauty of body, grace of performance, power and endurance from just a few weeks’ preparation. For the athlete to be sufficiently prepared required years of hard work by his actually doing the things performed in the games. He was required to lead a very strict life, with proper habits. Thus in many ways the life of the victorious Greek athlete cut out an appropriate pattern for the Christian to follow, both in Paul’s day and in ours. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font0"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Persons who have a right heart condition appreciate the need of doing what is wellpleasing in the sight of God. Although the world may exert pressure to cause them to follow its way, they stand firm in their devotion to Jehovah. They follow the course of practical wisdom outlined above. From their careful study of God’s Word in order to understand his will accurately, they see that frequent or even occasional loose living with the world does not properly fit with Christian ways into the life of the same individual. So they pay attention to the advice to strip off the old personality and strive to “be made new in the force actuating their minds.” Instead of filling their minds with old-world philosophy and filth they become well acquainted with the clean truth supplied by God and clothe themselves with a new personality. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">W  </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Some persons upon hearing the truth enjoy the spiritual food on Jehovah’s table. It tastes good and they come to our meetings for more. But instead of eating only from it they supplement their diet with crumbs from the Devil’s table. Refusing to dedicate themselves to Jehovah they attempt to follow the course of compromise. After nibbling at Jehovah’s table they expend their strength and time serving the interests and pleasures of this old world, all of which is contrary to God’s Word. However, arc we able to be friends of the old world and friends of God at the same time? No indeed, we are not, for Jehovah is &quot;a God exacting exclusive devotion.” Says he himself : “I . . . am a God not tolerating rivalry.” (Deut. 5: 9, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW,</span><span class="font0"> margin) Such divine edicts leave absolutely no room for us to compromise.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">16:34, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus knew what it would take to conquer this world. To follow him means to practice Christianity; it means a disowning of oneself in a life of dedication to the principles of Christianity. It calls for taking up the torture stake and sharing in the hardships and sufferings of Jesus. It means forsaking one’s own personal ambitions and desires for wealth, prestige and power. To follow Christ means to give up the old world, the whole world, and life, if necessary. It calls for full allegiance to Christianity, such as a soldier gives to the cause of liberty. Christians must stand ready to respond with the willingness of the prophet Isaiah. Having no attachments to this old world he was free to answer Jehovah’s call with “Here am I; send me.” This was the lot of Abraham and others through their faith. This must be the lot also of all those who would keep pace with the New World society. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span><span class="font0"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 4:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah had definite purposes in mind when he began creating living, intelligent creatures untold ages ago. He did not create them merely for companionship, for he was not lonesome, but was wholly selfsufficient. Then why did he create? He did so because it pleased him to create and to allow others to enjoy his goodness, companionship and wisdom. He desired to share life unselfishly with others. And so he surrounded himself with hundreds of millions of mighty spirit creatures who were able to enjoy directly his radiant glory. It was his purpose that they should serve him continually, faithfully performing the tasks he assigned to them. They were thus given the glorious treasure of full-time service. He meant for them to devote their time to bringing honor and glory to his name, to enjoying his goodness and love and to absorbing wisdom from him. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 4</span></p>

They have a theocratic form of government, where all the local servants are appointed for their good qualifications by the governing body of the New World society through the branch office. When appointed, they serve until others are assigned to take on the responsibilities. In fulfillment of Isaiah 60:17 (AS), “I will also make thy officers peace,” the general leadership has been one of goodness, which has built up merit for the congregations and brought Jehovah’s blessing. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 8b</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah cannot tolerate any other name to stand equal with his. He is above all. At one time he was alone, with all the power and authority in the whole universe. This supremacy he never has given and never will give to another. Everything that was made and given life was at the instance of Jehovah. He can create and destroy when he desires. But Jehovah wishes others to enjoy life; hence he gives life as a gift. In Jehovah’s doing so, however, he requires that his creature must recognize him as Sovereign Ruler and give him exclusive devotion. There is no room for competition or rivalry. When Jehovah created man and woman he did not create them to be worshiped. They were to be worshipers. Jehovah is in the position of a potter. He makes the clay of the ground into a form for his pleasure.

To test these inspired expressions of the mouthpieces of various religions to see whether they are inspired by God’s spirit or not, we do not have to go to spiritualistic seances or mediums but to God’s Word, as Isaiah 8: 15, 19-22 clearly shows.

<p><span class="font0">If we call Abraham on this occasion a liar we are obliged to ask, Did Jehovah use a liar and a faithless coward to supplicate him to heal Abimelecn, who had acted in his innocence? To understand God’s action toward his prophet we should not merely think of God’s faithfulness to his covenant with Abraham but of the circumstances back there. Abraham was in enemy territory and needed to exercise caution. He wanted to live to carry out God's purpose toward him. He saw good to use strategy toward those who might be provoked to injure or kill him in Jehovah’s service. He could have gone to war, but he chose to keep peaceful relations with the inhabitants of lands where he sojourned. He was not disposed to go to war with them over his wife.

<p><span class="font0">Now is the time to w<sup>r</sup>alk again in the old ways of truth, tearing down the stronghold of error and building up the knowledge of God. And once we come to a clear understanding of the Scriptures, we should not be on the defensive with regard to our faith, but on the offensive, fighting the spiritual warfare to share our knowledge with others. But rather than a frontal attack on false worship Paul advises the use of strategy in order to gain the most persons. Said he: “I have become all things to people of all kinds, that I might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:22, NW) Paul did not compromise the truth in preaching, but he used tact in his presentation. He considered how he might most effectively attack and tear down the mental barrier of error, thus freeing his hearers for joyful acceptance of the truth. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 15, 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">There is not this knowledge in all persons; but some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, as it is weak, becomes vile.—1 Cor. 8: 7,</span><span class="font0"> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the various faculties of the mind with which Jehovah has wisely equipped man is that known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conscience. </span><span class="font0">Conscience is an inward realization or sense of right and wrong that excuses or accuses one. Our perception of right and wrong must be constantly developed or educated from God’s Word so that we shall be sure we are constantly making the right decisions. By making decisions in harmony with God's Word we shall at all times have a clear and good conscience. We shall not be accusing ourselves of wrongdoing. Paul shows that a weak conscience may be owing to lack of knowledge. “All things are clean to clean persons [persons guided by a Bible-trained conscience]. But to persons defiled and faithless nothing is clean, but both their minds [mental ability] and their consciences are defiled.”—Titus 1:15, NW. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font0"> 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">must love your fellow as yourself. I am Jehovah.—Lev.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">19:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In these words the Bible confirms the existence of the basic principle of self-love in human nature, put there by God. These strong rights of self-love impel each one of mankind toward his own preservation, to defend his life and body from injuries, to avoid what may be hurtful and to provide all things needful to continue his existence. These self-interests cover a wide field and spark many other fields of human interests. Wholesome self-love or self-interest developed to a moderate degree is a good and proper thing and leads to a course of merit that produces rewards of happiness. But where the degree of self-love or self-interest develops to the exelusion of one’s neighbor or fellow man, then a course of badness has been embarked upon. In such cases self-love turns into extreme selfishness. This leads to troubles or faults for which one has to be responsible. He must pay in the form of adversity, a punishment that brings unhappiness. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 8, 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Train up a child in the way he should go.—Prov. 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first training a child receives is from its parents or its immediate guardians. The child is given a number of do’s and dou’t’s at first, and is gradually made familiar with elementary terms that affect it. Often this training is treated lightly, parents thinking that the child is too young. Whether parents realize it or not, the very young mind can take in much information, and it is during this period that many lasting traits are established. Frequently the child is even shrewd enough to train parents to wait upon it and to have its own way. This is not the Christian way, however, as Proverbs 22: 6 shows. The child is imperfect and sinful (not innocent and sinless, as some of the clergy would have people believe) and needs its steps directed to a righteous course. The child’s own choice often would lead it in an erroneous and selfish way. If, as Jeremiah aptly confessed, it is not in man to direct his steps, it is especially true of man as a child.—Jer. 10: 23. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, beeause I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion.—Ex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">20:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Satan, the archenemy of Jehovah, wants to turn away every person’s heart and mind from Jehovah, to hate him even as Satan and his demons hate Jehovah. The Devil has done and is doing everything conceivable to blind the minds of unbelievers, and he puts forth strenuous effort to mislead and blind believers too. He wants all men to worship any object, no matter how degrading. He will go to any limits to debauch mankind. But no matter what maneuvers the Devil makes, no matter how loud the propaganda to praise men and worship them, and no matter how severe the pressure of persecution on the true followers of Christ, the true God still demands of his genuine worshipers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exclusive </span><span class="font0">devotion. For Jehovah’s witnesses there is no room for compromise. They must not bow down to any other gods or serve them. If they do they die, for Jehovah will not tolerate any worship of men or idols. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with the demons.—1 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">10:20, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The blood of the communion sacrifice was sprinkled upon Jehovah’s altar, and the fat was burned upon it, as his direct part of the sacrifice. The breast and right leg became the priest’s. The remainder of the flesh was eaten by the one who presented the sacrifice. Thus the Israelites who ate from the communion sacrifice were having a meal in common with Jehovah. For a like reason the worshiper of the true God Jehovah should avoid idol sacrifices, argues Paul. Not that the idol in itself is anything, nor that the thing sacrificed to the idol takes on any new quality or value that changes it from being still a creation of Jehovah. But that lifeless, material idol represents a demon. So when a worshiper at a sacrifical feast ate part of the animal sacrificed to the idol, he was partaking of the table of demons, for the idol altar belonged to the demons. 17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trust in [Jehovah] with all your heart, and rely not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him, and he Will make straight your paths.—Prov. 3: 5, 6, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Get knowledge and wisdom and obey them, for they are a defense. (Eccl. 7: 12) This means study. You may not gain a perfect knowledge of all the finer details of many revealed truths. But you can and must understand the main features of the truth to enter the contest for life. You must be able to preach the fundamentals of the truth at any time called upon and to act as a teacher of others. Knowledge and wisdom will prevent your following your own way. Many fall out of the running path, because of thus trying to solve their problems. That is the course King Saul took. Samuel reproved him for not relying on God: “To obey is better than a sacrifice.” (1 Sam. 15:22, jVI7) </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">So</span><span class="font0"> be obedient. Do Jehovah’s work in Jehovah’s way. It is the way Jehovah has marked out through his organization.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">People . . . persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, you being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 21:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All this persecution from the Devil’s crowd comes because we are doing a good thing, giving Jehovah exclusive devotion. Just because we go about peacefully preaching the good news, which directs the attention of people to Jehovah and to true worship, the Devil and his demons and his whole organization oppose us. So, then, we see the thing that is hard is the stand we must take against the Devil and persecutors whom he raises up against human creatures for being faithful to God. The Devil has always been a cruel taskmaster, but Jehovah through his Son has given us work not difficult to do. It is merely to preach. It is this kind, simple Kingdom truth that we bring to people that the Devil and all his visible organization object to. Still ours is a happy lot, for Jesus told us under such conditions to “rejoice and leap for joy.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 5b</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">I have fought the right fight. </span><span class="font0">—2 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tim. i:7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is the kind of warfare no earthly nation need fear, for it is in the best interests of the people. It promotes a knowledge of God and a love for him and our fellow men. This tight is a constructive one, building up those of good will mentally, morally and spiritually. Its benefits are lasting in value, leading to life, with God’s favor. It unites men of all kinds in the bonds of enduring peace and mutual understanding through the Word of God. In all parts of the world we fight to advance Bible knowledge. We have taken the fight against darkness to the homes of the people, just as Jesus and the disciples did before us. Paul knew from firsthand experience what a fight the ministry meant, and the fight has not abated down to this day, but we continue with our peaceful ministry despite mobs, baus and imprisonment. We bring our message in peace, but it is being rejected with violence. This is a time of intensive spiritual warfare for the preaching of the Word. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">God.—Rom. 12:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those belonging to the New World society are determined to give exclusive devotion to the true God, Jehovah. They are done with the works of the flesh, for they have been washed clean in the blood of Christ. Now they must bring forth ‘fruitage of the spirit, which is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.’ These sound principles of right living may and must be followed by anyone desiring now to survive and enjoy the approval of Jehovah. By making the mind over, that is, by thinking now as Jehovah wants us to think, by thinking beneficially, uprightly, we shall surely equip and prepare ourselves for New World living. Every person who survives Armageddon will have proved to his fellows, as well as to himself and to the true God, that he really wants to be obedient to Jehovah, giving him exclusive devotion and joyfully worshiping him in his new world of righteousness forever. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Go on waging the right warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, which some have thrust aside and have experienced shipwreck concerning</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">their faith.—1 Tim. 1:18, 19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not only must we be dependable in our warfare and help the new ones through their first skirmishes to continue on walking worthily of God, but we must also live according to our faith, holding a good conscience. Paul had good reason for mentioning this, because some in his time had tried to subvert the faith, resisting the truth; and he warned that such ideas would be as deadly as gangrene if permitted to take hold. Just as a soldier who is hesitant or indecisive might well pay with his life, so may we if we do not hold firmly to our faith. We must let God prove to be true by faith and confidence in his Word. Hang on to it as to life itself. And just as the soldiers in Israel had to keep clean by sanctification for their warfare under God’s leadership, we today must keep a good conscience by living according to God’s requirements. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 3, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In many centuries now past Jehovah has proved that integrity-keeping persons can be faithful even under extreme adversity. When Jesus was upon the earth a new nation, a little flock, was being created, whom Jehovah destined to become joint heirs with Christ in his heavenly kingdom. Exclusive devotion to Jehovah is being given by all these, for they “are being built up together into a place for God to inhabit by spirit.” Now even more people of all nations are coming to worship Jehovah. Indeed, a great crowd are manifesting themselves in these days along with the remnant of the little flock. These other sheep know too that Jehovah their God is a God exacting exclusive devotion, and that he will not tolerate any rivalry; therefore they have separated themselves from the world. All in the one fold heed Jesus' statement that he was in the world but not a part of it, and they keep on seeking first the kingdom of Jehovah and his righteousness.

<p><a name="bookmark376"></a><span class="font0">There are not enough hours in a day to do everything we should like to do. So we must be selective in choosing our interests aside from those nature imposes upon us. As dedicated Christians we must sacrifice many worldly interests in order to balance our individual interests with the divine interests and our newly acquired congregational interests. As Christians we can wisely retain only those individual interests that keep building us merit with God, that we may reach the happy goal of everlasting life in the new world. Yes, each one of us now can make the right decisions that will build for us a record of merit with Jehovah as righteous ones. However, if we make wrong decisions that bring us disability, fault or sin, we shall reap the wages of sin, which is death.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 7: 8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Today we live in a period of judgment. The great Judge is dividing the righteous from the wicked, and only those who maintain soundness or integrity receive his approval. Even as predicted at llosea 4:1, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2, </span><span class="font0">at the present time we see integrity almost entirely forgotten world-wide. True, in the world there still are some honest persons, those who appreciate the value of integrity, such as the physician interested in the health of his patient, the lawyer who fights for justice, the laborer or clerk who gives genuinely good service and the person who truly loves honesty and who does not merely practice it because it is good policy. Refreshing as it is to hear of integrity kept among men, there is yet a more important consideration, namely, the keeping of integrity with God. Such integritykeeping by Jehovah’s slaves is praiseworthy and beautiful in his eyes. He will judge and in due time he will reward those practicing it.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 6:11, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The proclaiming of the message against Gog of Magog under adverse conditions serves a good purpose in that it puts the message-bearers to a test. Shall we obey Jehovah and continue to proclaim his ordained message or shall we water it down or quit altogether? Shall we stick to the organization Jehovah is now using in the earth or shall we attempt to break away from it and set up one of our own design and making? Here and there an isolated individual who stops walking in the counsel of Jehovah may drop out, but the organization as a whole will not fail in its dedicated purpose, because Jehovah’s purposes never fail. The message of warning against Gog and his forces will continue until the “cities” or organizations of this old system of things are no more to be found. So let us, as faithful witnesses of Jehovah, stand the enemy’s fire and thus prove our integrity under the test until that time. 17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span><span class="font0"> 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">When establishing Christianity Jesus called on his followers to exhibit the same faith Abraham had. And his apostles showed they had this faith. With willingness they responded to Jesus’ call. And when a disciple desired to turn back to bury his father, Jesus replied: “Keep following me, and let the dead bury their dead.” They let nothing stand in their way, neither occupation, family nor friends. These were placed in a secondary position and that more desirable thing, the kingdom of God, was placed first in their lives. There were not months of saving money before leaving their jobs, nor a cautious weighing of matters to see whether it would be worth it or not. Nor did the apostles question, What is there in it for me? Rather, their response was immediate, displaying great faith in Jehovah, in his Son and in the arrangement made for their continued existence. 17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span><span class="font0"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2: 38, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But why, after making a solemn dedication in one's own mind and heart, must one be baptized in water? Why is water baptism a divine requirement, and why must it be a public baptism by total immersion? The English W’ord “baptism” is drawn from the Greek verb meaning “to dip, submerge, immerse.” So to be baptized in water one must be plunged into it and be totally submerged from head to foot. Instead of this being a secret initiating rite, baptism, according to the Scriptures, is an open, formal ceremony, like a marriage ceremony, that is carried out publicly as a testimony before witnesses to establish legally that which an individual has already determined in his heart and mind. When one makes an unconditional dedication to Jehovah he becomes an alien to this old world. Therefore dedication is like taking out citizenship in the new world, and the formal ceremony of baptism is in effect an oath before witnesses confirming this fact. 17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font0"> 4, 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Already nearly six thousand years have passed since the rebellion in Eden; still Jehovah has allowed that first disrespectful creature (now Satan) to remain. However, Jehovah will not tolerate Satan’s disrespect forever. Very soon now, at Armageddon, God will show his sovereign power and prove that all devotion is exclusively his. Persons who love righteousness have given to the Sovereign Ruler exclusive devotion. We are living in wonderful days when God-given prophecies about the end of this system of things are having fulfillment. We should acquaint ourselves with the Bible, read it, study it and get accurate knowledge of it. By right thinking, by thinking the way God teaches us to think, we shall be happy to give exclusive devotion to the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah has made no exception to this rule: Stick to training. No contestant— runner, wrestler or boxer—can neglect training and expect to win. Not only will he have sore muscles from lack of training but he will lose. Jehovah’s team of righteous contenders began with Abel. The contest with the wicked spirit forces in heavenly places does not end until Armageddon. The theocratic team is like a modern Olympic team. It does not wind up at the end of the first contest. Many other contests follow. Also, a football team trains and then has a contest, trains and then another contest, until the end of the season. So we must train until the end of the season at Armageddon. This we keep up by regularity in meeting attendance, by being out in the service several times a week or every day and by personal study.

This spirit under Jesus’ direction is a means by which he fulfills the promise: “For where there are two or three met together in my name, there I am in their midst.” It is because of this very promise that God’s holy spirit as a helper is experienced upon every convention of Jehovah’s people. Each and every one present receives a peaceful and stimulating effect by attending the official meetings of Jehovah’s ministers. While we are assembled together this same holy spirit enables our minds to absorb spiritual information more readily, and enables us to register united heart reactions of praise to our great Creator and to show love toward our associates all around us.

<p><span class="font0">At Memorial we all must remember Jesus in the flesh. He did not come down from heaven to earth just to enjoy the flesh, to enjoy life in the flesh, as the disobedient sons of God in Noah’s day did. He made special use of that flesh in God’s service. He suffered in that body, leaving a model to us. In that body he did Jehovah’s earthly work, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Those who partake of the Lord's evening meal must, like Jesus, serve Jehovah. Their mortal bodies must be made alive through his spirit that resides in them. They must lay down their lives sacrificially in Jehovah’s service, thus using up their earthly lives but also living like Christ. The mortal bodies of those eating the Lord’s evening meal must be kept clean from immorality. As slaves of Jesus their bodies are brand-marked.

<p><span class="font0">The faithful angels joyfully serve the interests of their loving Creator. They do not push aside their duties as secondary to personal interests. No, they give their undivided attention and their full energies and abilities to serving Jehovah. Nothing is of greater importance to them. Those sent out as messengers go without hesitating for a moment. There is no holding back or the least sign of unwillingness to accept an assignment. They delight to do Jehovah’s will, because that is where their heart is. They find joy in serving Jehovah full time. The first of these, God’s mighty Son, was given many special duties, among which was the creating of the heavenly hosts. He joyfully devoted his energies to this task, finding pleasure in the full-time service of his God and Father.

<p><span class="font0">By drinking the cup the Christian spiritual Israelites picture themselves as being in the new covenant and as receiving the benefit of it, God’s forgiveness of sins through Jesus’ blood. By drinking that cup they picture themselves as drinking his blood. By drinking Jesus’ blood in that pictorial way they are drinking, not condemnation to themselves, but, instead, life benefits, for there is life in that blood. By figuratively drinking his blood through faith they are not condemned to death, no more than by eating his body, his flesh, figuratively through faith, can they be condemned as eating forbidden food to their death.

Therefore seek the local congregation’s advancement, share in its preaching campaign, enlarge its reputation as being the local official representative of God’s holy organization, keep the organization clean, live up to the exalted name of Jehovah that rests upon his witnesses and walk orderly as an example to all the new ones being brought into the local congregation. It being united in love, there is an organizational bearing of opposition and a sharing of joys, even as Paul shows in the words above. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font0"> 7/15 18, 17b</span></p>

Those who give in to the inclinations of the flesh by immoral conduct are warned that they will never inherit God’s kingdom, and even a little corruption will quickly ferment and spoil all our good works in God’s sight. Such fleshly desires war against the interests of our soul and must be warded off by means of the breastplate of righteousness. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 10, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Tim. 2:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the time of ancient Greece the importance of keeping team rules was permanently impressed on the mind of each contestant. Each took a vow to adhere strictly to all rules and training requirements. His restricted life was devoted wholly to practice sessions and training. Sworn judges enforced rules of the ancient contest. They lived with the contestants day and night, from beginning of training, to ensure against cheating. They enforced rigorous training. An athlete might be first to reach the goal, yet if he had not complied with all the rules he would forfeit the prize. So we also must comply with all rules. Even though we ran to the end we might lose the prize by not keeping the rules. The theocratic organization, like a team, keeps the rules of Jehovah. It comes off with the crown of triumph. But shall we? Not unless we individually obey all the rules. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font0"> 4-6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Training is not just a matter of presenting information for the mind, but it is also a matter of living up to it. Often children know what is right and proper, but they will not perform this unless disciplined. Truly, then, Christian parents should spend time teaching and molding the young minds with proper knowledge and then administer proper discipline, if necessary, to help them to carry out what they have learned. Learning to do what they have been told, and properly doing and continuing to do it—this will be easier as the building, so to speak, takes shape. Not only that, it will strengthen the mind of the child to discern between right and wrong and so fortify the mind against false doctrine and contamination of erroneous secular teaching in the schools and other contacts. It is also well to have ingrained in the child’s mind the counsel given by Paul: “Do not be misled.

<p><span class="font0">What a task that will be for the survivors, to cleanse the earth of every remaining evidence of Gog's forces! Even with the work well organized it will take seven months just to bury the bones. Scouting corps will be sent out on a full-time basis to search the land thoroughly and, when bones are found, markers will be set up for those with the spades and shovels who follow. Those privileged to share in that cleanup work will not view it as a revolting and disgusting assignment, but will rejoice to be alive when Gog’s long and oppressive rule has come to an end and when the wicked are no more. Survivors of Armageddon will be happy to have a share in preparing the earth for a global paradise of beauty and perfection under the reign of the King Jesus Christ.

Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.” (Prov. 30: 5, 6, &gt;18) We may not tell untruths in his name, for that puts God in the light of a liar. “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Rom. 3:4, NW) In Jeremiah’s day the false prophets prophesied lies in Jehovah’s name and lied against his purpose, foretelling in his name what he had not foretold. (Jer. 23:25) Therefore Jehovah was against them. He executed them at Jerusalem’s fall in 607 B.C.

In this he will fail, for in the end all persons who gain eternal life will give to God exclusive devotion. In that new world of righteousness Satan and all other opposers will be moved out of the way, annihilated, and only true worshipers will remain, all giving to God exclusive devotion.

<p><span class="font0">No matter what circumstance Christ was in, he always had the proper evaluation of the glorious treasure of fulltime service. His evaluation did not change when circumstances changed, as do the evaluations of those who place their heart upon material possessions. He did not even consider comparing the value of his Father’s service with any of the luxuries and comforts of this world, not even with the necessities of life. He rejected the riches, honor and power of this entire world in preference for God’s service. To fulfill this assignment, as he had fulfilled others, was all that interested him. This godly service was of far greater value to him, because it meant God’s approval and eternal life. His example of godly service is without question the finest any creature could follow. Here is a splendid example of appreciation for the treasure of full-time service, and it well illustrates the proper evaluation of that service. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 11, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Notice that this is not a matter of our merely developing a more charming personality, but it is a matter of accepting what God has provided and then keeping it renewed by drawing regularly on his storehouse of accurate knowledge as a guide to our daily life. A hazy understanding of the Bible will not have this effect; only an accurate knowledge of God’s Word can reach deep enough to make the change. The effect on our lives must be far-reaching, governing the things we talk about, what we do and even our motives. Through a study of the Bible a new world opens up to our view—a new world to learn about, a new world to live for. Our interest is no longer in selfish pursuits but in bringing praise to Jehovah.

With marvelous opportunities in the full-time service we see a lack of pioneers and of Bethel applicants. Few respond. Can we not see that this period of apparent peace is no time for such conduct? Our peacetime training should be extremely severe. It must be as hard as the final contest itself. The harder our preparation the easier will be the victory. Ancient runners trained with added weights and in heavy uniforms. For the contest they took off the weights and stripped themselves. So train for future contests. We win or lose, depending upon how we train for the contest. Peacetime training now means greater activity for us, regularity in the service, attendance at all meetings, thorough personal study.

We cannot allow ourselves to be tied down to this old world and at the same time think that we can keep step with this Christian society of ministers. We must be eager to answer Jesus’ call: “Come be my follower,” and answer it in the complete sense that Peter did: “We have left all things and followed you.” And we must leave all things behind, not with a longing, as did Lot’s wife, but rather with joy that such an opportunity has been extended to us to fulfill. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 11, 12</span></p>

(1 Cor. 13:8-11) Today we are not empowered to cast out demons as a sign of our being Christian witnesses of Jehovah. Neither are we authorized to kill off all spirit mediums and those who inquire of them or practice occult arts as did King Saul. But we are under divine command to keep all spiritism, which is demonism, out of the theocratic organization, keeping on the “complete suit of armor from God” as a defense against the assaults of the wicked spirit forces. We must also preach the message of the Kingdom, the truth, which Jesus said “will set you free,” and this will drive away all influence of the demons from all victims who seek to be freed from the enticements or the tightening grip of the demons.

<p><span class="font0">The whole loaf of unleavened bread that Jesus took was flat and brittle. So he broke it, as was the usual way when eating bread at all meals in those days. First, however, he pronounced a blessing; he blessed God. So no special meaning need be attached to his breaking the loaf; he did this in order to distribute it to his apostles, as when he fed the thousands. But Jesus did put a special meaning upon the loaf that he broke and gave them, as noted by the words above. By these words Jesus did not perform a miracle, transubstantiating the loaf, changing it from unleavened dough into human flesh. He still had all his own flesh; he had to have all his flesh, unblemished, with nothing taken away from it, in order to offer himself as a perfect sacrifice. His body had to be like the passover lamb, which pictured him. So he did not transmute the loaf, but merely used it to symbolize his body.

It sees beyond the wreckage of this old world to the blessings of life in the new world. And right now those associated with it are constructively equipping themselves for life under that righteous arrangement.

While we seek the prize, it is the Giver of the prize we love and want to please. Many fail because they do not pay attention to this goal of life eternal. It is life that we want and life eternal on earth is to the other sheep just as much to be desired as life in heaven is desired by the anointed ones called of Jehovah. Some are allowing the vision of Jehovah’s purpose, his kingdom and his theocratic work to grow dim. They will not study privately and do not attend study meetings. They have no vision. Such persons will not successfully reach the goal. Where there is no vision the people perish. (Prov. 29: 18) In the race have you lost sight of the prize?

That helper is also present at all our circuit, district, national and international assemblies. It is manifest that God’s spirit does not rest upon the gatherings of the spiritually sick people of false religious organizations. But long experience shows that God’s holy spirit does reside wonderfully with his people! Knowing this to be a fact, then, it means that in order for us to keep up with the truth we must unfailingly be present at every official meeting of God’s people with whom we are actively associated. Can we conceive of a ministerial angel in heaven finding an excuse for not being present when God’s court officially meets in heaven? Certainly not! So likewise we as God’s ministers should not have excuses for being absent from meetings. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font0"> 28a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Consider the apostle and high priest whom we conf ess—Jesus. He was faithful to the one that made him such.—Heb. 3:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1, 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Word gladly accepted whatever assignment God gave him. He did not consider fulltime service a glorious treasure in one section of the universe but undesirable in another. It made no difference to him where he was assigned to serve so long as he could be of use to his Father. And he has shown this same humble attitude and willingness to serve throughout his long career of full-time service. When Jehovah purposed to make a paradise home for intelligent, fleshly creatures, it was the Word who was assigned to carry out this purpose to fruition. Although the forming of the earth and the preparing of it for life were tasks requiring a great period of time, the Word did not lose interest in his work. He faithfully worked at his job until it was finished. By such faithful service he proved his dependability and was therefore given other assignments. He is the example that all other creatures would do well to follow. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span><span class="font0"> 7-9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">How should Jehovah's interests regarding his name, the earth and mankind concern us? Very vitally! Jesus set the pattern when he dedicated his life to the doing of Jehovah’s will, as shown by the scripture above, and by continuing in harmony with God’s every interest. We too must be in full accord with the divine will and always be in line with His divine interests. This we do by each one of us dedicating his life to the doing of His will and then symbolizing this by water baptism. We cannot be passive as to the divine interests. We cannot sit on the fence and be indecisive about these universal interests. We must become active by being conscious of these divine interests and of our relation to them. Indeed, our present and future salvation lies in being identified with God’s every interest in connection with this earth. God's goodness is ever being manifested in his divine interests, and happiness supreme will be our lot by keeping God’s interests in favorable balance with our other interests. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is incumbent upon every traveler to the new world, and especially upon the servants, to set proper examples. A servant cannot afford to let his habits get out of hand. The flock of God look to him for leadership. Some habits may very easily become immoderate unless selfcontrol is exercised. This is especially true of the eating and drinking habits. Neither gluttons nor drunkards will inherit God’s kingdom. Overeating shows a lack of judgment. It saps one’s energy and makes one mentally sluggish and sleepy. Overdrinking causes loss of self-control. A drunkard lacks poise, dignity and respectability. How can a drunkard represent the theocratic organization with a clean conscience? Impossible! Drunkenness dishonors the congregation of God.

<p><span class="font0">Never lose sight of the fact that this is Jehovah’s message that he long ago purposed should be delivered now. Of course, Jehovah is under no obligation to warn the wicked of their error, but because of his long-suffering with these vessels of wrath that are only fit for destruction Jehovah warns such ones of their impending execution even though the message only hardens their already stony hearts. This exposure of Gog’s global operation infuriates this wicked one and he schemes how to silence Jehovah’s witnesses for making these things known. To stop their preaching activity Gog causes his earthly agencies to heap up much persecution upon the witnesses. We may confidently expect that Gog of Magog in his maddened desperation will in the future attempt to make even greater efforts to w'ipe us out completely. That final desperate attempt, however, will mark the beginning of Armageddon. But regardless of what Gog does we must continue to prophesy against him, for Jehovah has spoken. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah himself sets the example of perfect soundness or integrity. He may always be relied upon, even as Moses assured the Israelites. And to us who live today on earth he still manifests his love and faithfulness in numberless ways. As inferiors to a superior, we owe obedience, devotion and allegiance to our sovereign God, our Lawgiver and Judge. As his offspring we should seek to reflect his integrity-keeping course. To do less would be inconsistent. Thankfulness should make us want to act constructively and in agreement with the work of our Father. It is, then, only the course of wisdom for us to give heed to God’s instructions, for his word is trustworthy and all his commandments arc faithful. Keeping these will enable us to maintain integrity and therefore be adjudged worthy of the reward of life.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Mark 14:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus was not merely flesh, not some bloodless incarnation or materialization. He came to ransom human children of blood and flesh, and so it is written: “Since the ‘young children’ are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things.” (Heb. 2:14, NW) Hence in setting up this evening meal that his disciples were to celebrate in remembrance of him Jesus called attention to the part his blood was to perform. He took the cup, full of what he said was the “product of the vine,” and “offered thanks and gave it to them, and they all drank out of it.” At that time he said to them: “This means my ‘blood of the covenant’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.” (Matt. 26:28, NW) Thus Jesus remarked on the special use that his blood was to serve, namely, the putting into force of a new covenant with the forgiveness of the sins of many disciples. So he gave his blood and flesh for them. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font0"> 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A fixed rule of training for the theocratic contestants is that God’s Word must be preached. Why wait until the dictator, the concentration camp or the prison bars of the Devil surround you? The prophets of old did not put off preaching until tomorrow. Jeremiah said that the word of God was like a fire burning within his bones and he could not keep it in; he had to get it out—to preach! Jesus, who started this race for us, was anointed to preach. Our main job, like his, should be the ministry. Fail to preach now and the wicked ones’ loss of life will be charged up against you. Preach now and you will not be responsible for their death. Once we enter, we cannot be absent at training time. And training time is now, not tomorrow. Inactivity means death. We must be active now if we would live tomorrow.

<p><span class="font0">Jesus said that his disciples would be outstandingly distinguished by the quality of love. But that love must be properly directed to be acceptable. Christian love must be guided by accurate knowledge and discernment of God’s will, and our attention should be centered on the more important things. The first object of our love is Jehovah, and we must love our neighbor as ourselves. But we may not love the old world. True love, we are told, “does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.” Thus, accurate knowledge enables us to direct our love toward Jehovah and the ones he approves and the things he loves, and it helps us to avoid the snare of sentimentally showering affection on the world that is in opposition to God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 15</span></p>

The Devil told Eve: ‘If you eat of this tree of knowledge of good and evil you will be like God.’ This idea is still instilled in man, and man wants to be worshiped, even though he is nothing—just dust of the ground, clay formed into a beautiful creature by the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and given life by that Creator. But the living creature does not want to praise his Creator. He becomes proud and self-important; and it is not long until he begins to tell God wherein </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">He</span><span class="font0"> is wrong, as do Christendom’s clergy.

Remember how Lot offered to let the howling mob of Sodomites have his two espoused daughters for their lust in order to protect the lives of the two men whom he had as guests in his house. Remember how later the old man of Gibeah offered his virgin daughter and his guest’s concubine to a like mob of Benjaminites in order to protect the religious Levite whom he was entertaining. So Abraham represented Sarah as his sister to prevent violent controversy over his wife. Sarah recognized Abraham as her lord and agreed to the arrangement, willing to take the consequences of it. She was willing to do her part to preserve the life of Jehovah’s prophet, with whom He had made a covenant. Abraham looked upon this as an expression of her loving-kindness to him, and Sarah viewed it in the same way, W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span><span class="font0"> 14</span></p>

What could be more trying than to know that, before one spoke, the people would not listen? Jeremiah had to contend with that. What would you do if you were faced with a like situation? Knowing before you even began speaking that your efforts would be fruitless, would you give up? Would you quit Jehovah’s full-time service because you felt your labors were in vain? Or would you cling to that treasure and fulfill your commission as Jeremiah did?

As to keeping “awake with all constancy,” this is certainly necessary for a soldier, but especially for Christians today in this time of urgency.

To this end the congregation is organized for fieldpreaching service, having received an appointed tenitory in which to preach to the public from house to house, which preaching is done in an orderly way. All co-operate toward carrying out this preaching service as a united congregation. The local congregation is an object of attention and a spectacle to those on the outside.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus took a loaf and, after saying a blessing, he broke it and, giving it to the disciples, he said: “Take, eat. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">means my body.”—Matt. 26:26, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">his body? Yes; his own body, his whole body, head and all, that he was to give for them. Jesus meant his own body, the body with which he next associates his blood when speaking of the cup. For thirty-three and a half years that body had held the blood that was to be poured out on the torture stake at Calvary. The life of that fleshly body was its blood. Since that body was to be given for his disciples, he did not take it back at his resurrection from the dead, but God prepared another body for him, not on earth but in heaven, a spiritual body. In his natural, earthly body Jesus bore the reproaches of opposers, and in spite of it all he kept integrity toward God untarnished. He gave up his existence in the flesh for his disciples. “Even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely.” Thus he opened up the way for them to go to heaven. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">19:21, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus’ words regarding loving God with our whole heart, soul, mind and strength and about completeness of dedica--tion contain the thought of integrity. And what a beautiful quality it is! In Jehovah it is comparable to a great mountain, immovable, dependable, unchangeable. In human integrity-keepers of past time it may be likened to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">firm boulder on a rockbound coast, against which the waves of an angry sea may dash but which stands unmoved, firmly rooted in its own sure place. Those who have integrity are like vessels of utility gracing the rich table of a noble house. In such a setting a simple pitcher of water can serve a good purpose when whole or unbroken; but if the pitcher leaks it is as useless as a person of marred integrity. So “be a vessel for an honorable purpose, . . . useful to his owner, prepared for every good work.”—2 Tim. 2:21, A17. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah has provided an organization on earth that is being trained to accept increased congregational interests and he docs not deal with individuals apart from it. As God’s kingdom increases its influence on earth, more and more community interests will come to the New World society, until after Armageddon all such on earth will come into its hands. As in the days of Noah and of Moses, God is dealing with a congregational society of people. It is as a vast unified flock that we are being led by the Right Shepherd. We hear his voice, accept his leadership and come into his foldlike organization. So adjust your own affairs, reduce your unnecessary personal interests, take on a balanced program of divine and congregational interests that will lead you on the way to life, and become yoked in the harness with Jesus Christ.—Matt. 11: 29, 30.

<p><span class="font0">Jesus was not likening his blood to that of the passover lamb even though it typified Jesus and its blood, sprinkled on the doorposts and lintels of the Israelites’ houses, caused the firstborn inside to be spared. It was not the blood of the passover lamb that put into force the law covenant that the prophet Moses mediated. It was not the blood of the passover lamb that was sprinkled upon the law book of the covenant and upon the people, Moses then saying: “Here is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has concluded with you as respects all these words.” No, it was the blood of different animals; and because Jesus was pointing forward to the making of a new covenant between Jehovah and his disciples, he quoted Moses’ words, the “blood of the covenant,” and applied these words to his own blood. Young bulls and goats provided the blood on that occasion. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font0"> 21, 22</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark378"></a><span class="font0">That is the way Jehovah's witnesses think. At some time in their lives they were a part of the old world. But they no longer are going to serve the gods cast of the Euphrates River, that is, the gods of Babylon, or the gods of Egypt. Instead, Jehovah’s witnesses have heeded the words: “Get out of her, my people, if you Jo not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” They have come out willingly and will not abandon Jehovah so as to serve other gods. Soon the Devil and his whole demonic organization will be abyssed because of not giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah. If we want to live, not die, we must give Jehovah exclusive devotion. We must willingly choose to dedicate our life to Jehovah’s service and follow his commandments. By following the commandments of God we prove that we love God. We show obedience to the will of God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> l-3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, ... And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">While spiritualists claim to go to the Bible, this is all as a bait, as a disguise, to calm the conscience and to entice one into spiritualism as something Scriptural, having God's approval and being thoroughly Christian. It follows the tactics of the false apostles. The hidden aim is to get you to believe less and less in the Bible and to rely more and more on your experiences with observed phenomena of spiritualism, to get you to perverting the Bible and believing just the opposite of what it teaches, yes, to destroy your faith in the Bible. This is illustrated by what a prominent British spiritualist once wrote regarding belief in the inspiration of the Bible, namely, that it has “been one of the greatest hindrances to the progress of humanity.” 17 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span><span class="font0"> 13, 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">True Christian witnesses will not act contemptuously toward Jehovah’s table. They make it their first concern to take the choice words of the Bible and offer them as the fruits of their lips. They use the words that are sound and enlightening and productive of spiritual health. Even though the majority are not conscious of their spiritual need, there is a minority of many thousands who are. As these turn to the Bible truth served up by us they will be spiritually nourished and satisfied. So we must be sure that we have studied to gain the right answers, the forceful words and clean explanations that will magnify Jehovah and his Word and purposes. They must not be vague and sickly and weak, but so powerful that they overwhelm and crowd out of our listener’s mind the false words implanted there. The necessary words are in the Bible; we must get them out for use as a sacrifice of praise. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that tvill I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire in his temple.—Ps. 27:4, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nothing brought greater joy to David than serving the interests of his God. The words above clearly reveal where his heart was. He had no desire to be anywhere else than in Jehovah’s service. He sincerely yearned for Jehovah’s praises to be sung among the nations and for the Creator’s marvelous works to be proclaimed far and wide. This desire was beautifully expressed in the thanks he gave Jehovah at the time the ark was brought to Jerusalem and placed in the tent he had prepared for it alongside his palace. Here was the heartfelt expression of one who was fully devoted to God’s service and who looked upon it as the most precious of all treasures. David opened his expression of thanks by saying: “Thank Jehovah, call upon his name, make his deeds known among the peoples! Sing to him, make melody to him.”—1 Chron. 16: 8, 9, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW. W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 9:23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These words of Jesus show that true followers of his should dedicate themselves to do Jehovah’s will even as he did. One who disowns himself disowns his personal possession of himself or his choice of a life career and seeks to learn what is God’s will for him and then to deport himself accordingly. He ceases doing his own will and, instead, always diligently seeks to learn and do God's will. If, then, your disowning of your personal choice of a course or way of life in order that God's will may be done by you brings ridicule, reproach and all manner of hardships and persecutions, and even torture, still that, according to God’s Word, is only one’s reasonable service to God; and that is all that he requires. It is true that dedication places a heavy load of responsibility upon one. And faithfulness in carrying that load is mandatory! But if we claim to be Christians we must assume that burden or else we shall be playing the hypocrite. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 13, 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A very important piece of equipment for the spiritual warfare is the “sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.” This is essential for both defensive and offensive actions. What good is a soldier without his weapon? or how long will he last in battle if he does not know how to use it? In like manner, for a minister of the gospel to have a Bible without being able to use it effectively and to find scriptures is to render himself helpless in spiritual warfare. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Accept</span><span class="font0"> the sword of the spirit, Paul says. He commended the Beroeans for their diligent consideration of the Scriptures and their acceptance of what was proved. We should do as they did. It is by this Word that God reveals his purpose and his will for mankind and his requirements for life. With this sword of the spirit we are armed for the attack and made mighty through God for the pulling down of strongly entrenched things. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">When we consider the infinite Creator, Jehovah, we are amazed at his holiness, his perfection. The exactness of his justice, the depth of his wisdom, his long-suffering and obliging love and his irresistible power cause the understanding creature of flesh and blood to stand in wonder at the revelation of those attributes of his Creator, even as did Moses. God created man in his own image, with perfect freedom to exercise his own attributes of justice, wisdom, love and power as occasion required, yet wisely guided in their right use by the statement of God’s law. That divine law was given not to restrict us in the proper exercise of our liberties but merely to guard us against improper use of these powers, so as not to injure others or ourselves. Appreciating these facts truly we will want to fear Jehovah with songs of praise. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In itself the one unleavened loaf symbolizes not the symbolic body of Christ but the human body that he sacrificed. The act of eating that loaf in common participation is what indicates that all the eaters are one body. By their participation in Jesus’ flesh and blood they have all been declared righteous by God, to serve as a steppingstone toward their being sacrificed with Christ and then begotten by God to become his spiritual children. Then as his spiritual children with a hope of heavenly life God anointed them with his spirit, to make them members of Christ’s body. By this he brought them into the covenant for the heavenly kingdom. These are the facts that they symbolize by partaking of the loaf and wine cup. Their joint participation in the Lord’s evening meal marks them as exclusive, as one sanctified body under Jesus Christ the Head.

<p><span class="font0">Today’s youth is tomorrow’s manhood. Therefore the quality and maturity of tomorrow’s manhood are dependent upon the training that is given youth today. One of youth’s training centers is the home, with Christian parents as the teachers. Mature teachers in the Christian home will use us  the leading textbook God’s Word the Bible, and this will furnish the proper background for youth in preparation for a proper place in the New World society. The child’s mind becomes what it is fed. Since the mind directs or influences the person, immediately we sense how important is a proper mental diet. There is also the indirect way, vitally important, and that is by example. Even a ten-year-old youth patterns himself after parents, teachers and other influences to which he may be subjected. As noted above, Jesus taught his disciples by example.

By that you pretend to have fellowship with the God of light, but you are not actually doing so at all. You are fooling yourself, acting hypocritically, walking in the darkness and lying. You are inciting Jehovah to jealousy, for he is a God exacting exclusive devotion. He will not accept a divided love. Such inciting of Him leads to serious consequences for “we are not stronger than he is.” So we have no measure of strength able to withstand and overpower the destruction that he brings upon us for inciting him to jealousy.

So be theocratic, loyal to Jehovah God, in picking a marriage partner for yourself or for your child or friend. Keep cle.ar of responsibility for spiritual shipwreck. Do not lay hands hastily, untheocratically, on a marriage mate for anyone: “neither be a sharer in the sins of others ; preserve yourself pure.” Whether a marrying agent of the New World society will solemnize the marriage of such an unequally yoked pair is left to his own conscience. If he does decide to perform the ceremony he is but acting as an agent of the state government and he does at least have an opportunity to point out to the worldly or undedicated person the responsibilities of marriage to a Christian and to encourage that person to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses like his partner.

<p><span class="font0">The Christians in the new covenant who drink of the wine cup and eat of the loaf of unleavened bread show by this action that they arc partaking of the human sacrifice of Christ, its blood and its flesh.

They are picturing how they are partaking of the benefit of forgiveness of sins and of salvation through Christ’s blood-and-flesh sacrifice, and sharing these things with all the spiritual Israelites who are in the new covenant. But that is not all. These are also sharing with Jehovah God, and primarily with him.

Since it does not possess its value because of rarity, it is available to all who want it. That treasure of uncqualed value is the fulltime service of Jehovah. Since it brings eternal life to the one who reaches out for it and holds it, what is a precious stone or a whole roomful of such stones in comparison with it? Little wonder is it, then, that Paul considered such things as refuse, in comparison with the knowledge and service of God! This, of course, is a set of values entirely in reverse of that possessed by the world. That is why the decision to reach out for the treasure of full-time service is a grave one that requires careful consideration. A person must know what he is doing.

<p><span class="font0">Did God ever need a wife or a living organization in holy union with him? No! Was it good for him to be alone? Yes. Everything that gave him pleasure and happiness was in himself; he felt no need of any kind, and his being entirely alone never hurt him or filled him with lonesomeness. Nor did he need a wife to help him produce children. Full creative power was all in himself. No wife demanded offspring by him or obliged him to give her offspring. Why, then, after being alone from eternity did he begin to create? Because he is love. He saw the way to express his love and let creatures enjoy his love. And so, not induced by anything outside, but being moved by his own perfect love, he himself willed to create. His heavenly creatures now know this fact, for they say to him: “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed.”—Rev. 4 :11, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A'</span><span class="font0"> IF.

Therefore he who wants to live and gain God's favor must be humble before Him and recognize Christ's redemptive provision and at the same time carry out His commandments.

He stressed that to follow him continually meant for one to be free from worldly ties and obligations. Food, clothing and shelter were made incidentals. The principal thing was the Kingdom ; in comparison to it all other things faded into nothingness. What better reason could be given than the above words of the apostle John as to why to abandon this world and dedicate oneself to the kingdom of God? And if it took absolute faith in Jehovah and Jesus Christ to keep pace with the growing Christian church of the first century, does it require less today?

In the congregation the overseers, who are spiritually older men, and the ministerial servants may be husbands of one wife only. They are the men to be followed as examples of the flock, and so all other married persons in the flock may have only one living marriage mate. Christians must stick to their marriage mates in faithfulness, in love, so remaining in it associated with God. This does not permit a man to have sex relations with any other woman. He should be satisfied with and draw delight from sexual relations with only his wife, as written at Proverbs 5: 15-20 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(AT). </span><span class="font0">Committing adultery makes the guilty one subject to dis-fellowshiping from the New World society.

<p><span class="font0">Integrity enters into every feature of our life. Loyalty and obedience are required of ns in all things. Obedience often has been a hard lesson for former children of disobedience to learn. How important, then, to have a good conscience and to, follow the leading of God’s spirit and not the inclination of the flesh I Remember, keeping integrity never was easy; and the Devil and his hordes will make it even harder, because he has but a short time. Our work is to announce God’s kingdom under Christ and to liberate people of good will from Satan’s snare and his wicked spirits, even as we ourselves have been made free by the truth. Only in this way can God-fearing persons keep integrity. By faithfulness, by keeping integrity, we place in God's hand the answer to Satan’s malicious challenge that proves Satan to be a false accuser.—Prov. 27 : 11. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font0">14-16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">If we are to get in our possession acceptable fruits and unblemished bullocks of the lips we must take teaching from Jehovah. Take it through Bible reading. Take it by systematic study. Take it at congregational meetings. Especially there does Jehovah spread a spiritual meal on his table. Come and get it! Go to the table, go to the Kingdom Hall! By your attending meetings and commenting you can keep testing whether you arc in the faith. If your comments go astray others more mature can bring you back to the right thought. Besides, how else can we as a congregation meet the divine requirement that all speak in agreement, unless we come together? And unless we do all these things we shall not be doing our utmost to present ourselves approved to God. We shall not be able to offer him a suitable sacrifice of praise of lips.

<p><span class="font0">There is now no procreation mandate laid upon Christians. Otherwise, no Christian should remain single and childless. So no Christian obligation exists now to have children. To keep as free as possible for direct Kingdom service some Christian couples may choose to remain childless, thereby avoiding parental obligations and keeping unburdened. If there were now in force a procreation mandate, all married members of the New World society would choose to have children immediately, and not delay it till after Armageddon, if possible. Although under the original procreation mandate from God, Adam and Eve did not have any children while they were in the garden of Eden. It was not for their failing to conceive children at once that they were driven out. No married couple should be criticized for failing to have children now before Armageddon. This is in keeping with the principle Paul enunciated at 1 Corinthians 7 : 29. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Jas. 2: 25, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rahab took the two Israelite spies into her house, because she feared their God Jehovah. When the king of Jericho sent men and demanded that she bring out the two spies, should she have handed them over to suffer the fate of spies? Would that have been trusting in their God to protect them? Would that have pleased Jehovah and shown she had faith in him and had adopted his cause? Did it not require strength of faith in Jehovah to refuse the king’s demand and to turn his officers away with a misdirection? Remember that there was war then. The enemies did not deserve to learn the truth to the hurt or endangerment of Jehovah’s servants. In wartime it is proper to misdirect the wolfish enemy. God’s Word commends her action as the practical proof of her faith. So the lives of Rahab and her relatives were spared when Jericho’s walls fell and its other inhabitants were wiped out. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah’s witnesses, as members of his New World society, are determined to maintain their earth-wide oneness, so apparent at their international assemblies in recent years. Up till now their oneness has proved to be unbreakable, in spite of all the persecutions that have been heaped upon them, in spite of all the political differences that have divided Catholics, Protestants and Jews. The spirit of Satan’s world has divided Christendom against itself. But the one loving spirit of Jehovah God has kept Jehovah’s witnesses one throughout the earth. They are now active in 160 lands. But no matter in which land they live, no matter of what color they are, of what nationality, of what language, they stick together. Their oneness is a tried and tested fact of today.

<p><span class="font0">To be properly nourished from Jehovah’s table we must go about it in a systematic way. To enjoy physical health regular eating habits and proper mastication of food are essential. Is not the same true of our spiritual diet? Each day we should set aside time for study; if possible, at a time when our mind is alert. Then when we set aside time, we should hold to it. Our spiritual health depends on it. If we are eating dinner when a friend comes in we probably invite him to join us. Well, then, when we are studying </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> or our Bible and a friend comes in and asks, “What are you doing?” do we say, “Oh, nothing,” and set it aside? Why not rather invite him to join us? For the sake of our spiritual health we may not treat lightly our habits of spiritual feeding, but must take them even more seriously than the eating of physical food. We should have the appreciation of God’s words that Job had. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 1-H:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah teaches us to war and to fight through study, association and service. Each plays an essential part in our training. Study includes both intense and constant personal study and also sharing actively in congregational studies, all a part of the training program to prepare us for the fray. From association we draw encouragement and confidence and are assured of the wholehearted support of our brothers. No one has a chance in a fight if he stands alone; so association is vital. Then in the service we have the opportunity to test our equipment, strengthen our knowledge and get accustomed to using the sword of the spirit. Use these provisions of Jehovah to the full and, after you have done everything in your power, God will supply what is needed for victory. For “we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves.”—2 Cor. 4: 7-11, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span><span class="font0"> W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span><span class="font0"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for thee.—Ps. 25 : 21, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Without integrity it is impossible to win God’s judgment of approval. To become an integrity-keeping witness of Jehovah one must repent of one’s former wrong course, exercise faith in the ransom sacrifice of Christ and then dedicate oneself to Jehovah for exclusively and eternally serving him. This means walking according to the new world, a very happy way. And having made this vow of dedication one must now fulfill it, for God has no pleasure in covenant-breaking fools. Never may we let the requirements of this obligation fade from our minds. Whatever sphere of activity we undertake, whatever commitments we might make, whatever ambitions we might seek to gratify, Jehovah’s rightful claim, yes, his prior claim, to our exclusive devotion we must take into consideration. Accordingly, his prior claim upon us must limit or nullify other undertakings. Keeping integrity in his sight, according to the way he judges us as his exclusively devoted ones, must be foremost in our lives. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Like Jehovah’s ancient witnesses, Ezekiel, Jeremiah and Isaiah, we today are under heavy responsibility before the Most High God. “We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us.” As true Christians substituting for Christ we follow the course and example he set. He was a witness for Jehovah, but not a selfappointed one. His message was Jehovah’s message. He did not speak of his own initiative. So likewise has it been with Jehovah’s witnesses in this twentieth century. They have not appointed themselves to be God’s witnesses. Jehovah has made the appointment. They did not so much as choose their name, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” God did. To start with they were but “a child,” untrained and inexperienced, yet by applying themselves to a diligent study of his Word and with his holy spirit and his blessing upon their efforts they have become adequately qualified for their divine assignment. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The first one whom the Almighty God created thus speaks for himself, identifying himself to us, so that there is no mystery. He is the one who was once down here on earth nineteen hundred years ago and who is now known as Jesus Christ. “The First and the Last,” and “the beginning of the creation by God”? (Rev. 3:14, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font0"> Yes. He was the “First” whom the alone God Jehovah created by himself, unaided. He was also the “Last” whom Jehovah God created by or through no one else. In this way he was the beginning of God’s creation, not the beginner of God’s creation. This first creature of God became a man and died as a human sacrifice and was raised from the dead and returned to heaven. So he was also the first to be raised by God’s direct, unaided power and he is the last to be thus raised, for God now uses him to resurrect all the others dead iu the graves. He was thus the beginning of a “new creation” of God. —2 Cor. 5: 17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span><span class="font0"> W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span><span class="font0"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">God created the sexes particularly for the peopling of the earth by bringing forth children. His law to Israel provided that a wife should have from her husband her sustenance, her clothing and her marriage due undiminished. This means she has the right to have children if she wants them. This was shown by God’s law of brother-in-law marriage. A man was also entitled to have children by his wife. If he was simply engaged to marry a girl he could not be drafted till after the engagement was over and he was fully married. Even then he could not be drafted until he had lived a year with her as a married man and had the opportunity to have a child by his wife and see and enjoy it. Her claim on the man preceded that of the army, for her sake and for the sake of the family name. He must give her the marriage due. She must give him his due.

Ananias and his wife tried to lie to God, but the holy spirit in Peter sharpened his perceptions to see that Ananias was trying to lie to God, and the spirit immediately killed Ananias and later also Sapphira his wife for the same reason. Similarly, at Jericho’s fall Achan tried to act out a lie and test the detective power of God's spirit. The deceptive work did not escape Jehovah's notice and Achan was exposed as the greedy troublemaker of Israel, and he and his household were stoned to death in due punishment, Later King Saul tried to lie to God and to his spirit in Samuel. Saul tried to give a religious flavor to his keeping the best of the plunder and King Agag himself alive, but Samuel exposed the rebellious, presumptuous hypocrisy, saying: “To obey is better than a sacrifice, to pay attention than the fat of rams.” Lying to God never succeeds.

Are they interested in exclusive devotion to him, or do they want to keep one foot in the old world and one in the new? When God sets out a course of action for us, then certainly that course of action must be followed by everyone that wants to live eternally in God’s new world. No individual decides whether baptism is right or wrong. A person dedicating himself to Jehovah and wanting life in the new world must know it is compulsory to be baptized. The one who privately thinks it to be a silly formalism puts himself in the position of criticizing the Creator. Has the one created a right to criticize or find fault with what the Sovereign Ruler demands of any one of his creatures?

That prophecy describes men lacking in virtue, from whom we must turn. It shows contrast and controversy between that which is virtuous and that which is not. W  there were not such things as the elements that constitute virtue, this scripture would have no force. Virtue does exist, however. The very fact that there are vital issues and controversies between righteousness and unrighteousness is proof that such good qualities of virtue do exist. Consistently, God’s Word reveals wrongdoing in contrast with God and his righteousness. To preserve Christian virtue we must turn away from all lacking in virtue.

To be enriched by his blessing we must always be diligent in his service, putting forth real effort at all times, and having great patience and determination for the work at hand to see it is done, following through with assigned tasks. The blessing of Jehovah is obtained by doing those things he commands, by really pleasing him. Certainly we must not act on our own initiative, even as Jesus did not. He was a faithful steward and carried his responsibility and so gained a full reward. He is our perfect example. On the other hand we may not evade responsibility, make excuses to escape blame. To obtain Jehovah’s blessing we must have a selfsacrificing spirit, not one of self-indulgence, which leads one to please himself rather than God.

As the anointed King he proceeded to launch this new way of serving God. In order that others might know how this service was to be rendered, Christ set the example by going from place to place preaching the good news of the Kingdom and the wonderful acts of God. Here was an educational work that was unparalleled. It was a work of gathering together persons who would be worthy of the gift of eternal life.

It docs not matter W  they do confine the sex act to just themselves; it is still moral uncleanness, fornication. It is a taking of license to do something without getting a legal license. It is incontinence or lack of self-control over the sexual appetite. It is a loosening of conduct by the engaged pair, hence a work of the flesh that wars against the spirit. W  parents permit this or even countenance it and arrange for it, they are delinquent, failing of their theocratic duty.

<p><span class="font0">While Christian couples might chose not to have children for the sake of the Kingdom service, this is not saying that they should not give each other the sexual due. Nor is it saying that they should make an agreement beforehand to live a celibate life after marriage, having no sexual relations but merely enjoying each other’s companionship. No one should think that he is thus raising marriage to a spiritual level and keeping it on an exalted, unflesbly plane, and so belittling the marriage of others who have sexual relations. W  a married couple does not want to pay marriage dues, then they should not marry at all and not subject the mate to deprivation of what is natural and craved naturally. By celibacy they are not putting marriage on a level higher and holier than that of others. They cannot change God’s honorable sexual arrangement. Celibate marriages have therefore never fared well.

He withheld from her the promised Seed so long and he also let those on earth who arc her spiritual children suffer at the hands of men and devils, seemingly without divine protection. All this has given the enemy wrong impressions, and they have felt free to try to defile the representatives of Jehovah’s wifely organization.

On this test the loyal creatures can be separated from the lawless, and the wickedness of Satan clearly revealed. Through display of his love, and at great cost to himself, Jehovah purposed to rescue some among the sin-cursed descendants of Adam who, appreciating the issue involved, chose to keep their integrity.

Only by previous study can we answer effectively. And we have to dig into the Bible for these truths as a miner digs for precious metals. (Prov. 2:1-7) Jehovah has laid up sound wisdom for us in the Bible; W  we seek it diligently he promises that we shall find it. We should therefore read the Bible regularly. Israel’s king had to write his own copy of the law and “read in it all the days of his life.” In those days copies of the Holy Scriptures were scarce and few persons had individual copies, so public readings were commanded.

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah is a God of love, justice, wisdom and power. lie is the God of integrity, dependable, loyal, honest and moral. In fact, the words we use to express men’s noble thoughts and their understanding and appreciation of these good and high qualities are inadequate to describe fully the righteousness of Jehovah. Not only do these high qualities exist, but the fact that they are possible of attainment by men is a wonderful assurance to those who love righteousness. The Almighty has always been seeing to it that his worship is preserved in the earth. The preservation of Jehovah’s worship has meant the preservation of human life upon the earth. It has also meant the preservation upon earth of virtue, so that in our day it is possible for us to ‘consider these things.’ W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span><span class="font0"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Having intercourse is not a degrading of married life, but is following an honorable, rightful course. There is no proper marriage for so-called “Platonic friendship” just because the end of the world is so near. W  an engaged couple think natural connections are carnal, then why wed at all? Why have one of the opposite sex so close to one all the time, in the most intimate privacy? W  it is not good or spiritually upbuilding to touch a woman, why live so intimate with her even in celibate marriage? Be natural, be normal, do not be falsely idealistic. Do not be like some Irish Catholic girls who get married but refuse to give their husbands their dues because they want to imitate Jesus’ mother Mary and remain “ever virgin.” The apostle Peter instructed them never to handle their married life that way, but to recognize their husband as their “lord.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The tenderness of parents toward their children is a basic principle in human nature. Children from their birth are wholly unable to provide for the least of their needs. But the paternal and maternal love of the parents supplies for this weakness. This parental interest and care of the young is one of the most powerful laws in nature. This field of interest requires the parents to supply protection, food, clothing, education and discipline and to use coercive means for the child’s good when the situation so requires. Particularly mothers, in discharging this field of interest wisely in the way of goodness, are heavily occupied and find it almost a full-time undertaking. But it also yields blessings and joys. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 12a</span></p>

A Christian may find himself under constant attack in his own home. It is very difficult to stand up under the test of constant family opposition and ridicule. To overcome this we need the large shield of faith, which is strengthened by the truth, and to carry on prayer on every occasion in spirit. We must keep seeking the Kingdom interests first.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In view of the Scriptural examples of Rahab, David and others Jesus was in harmony with the spirit of Jehovah in thus instructing his apostles when he sent them out as sheep among wolves. Since the unchristian wolves declare war upon the sheep and choose to make themselves fighters actually against God, it is proper for the inoffensive sheep to use war strategy toward the wolves in the interests of God’s work. No one against whom this strategy is used is unrighteously hurt because of it, whereas the sheep or those interests that deserve to be protected are safeguarded. God does not oblige us to show the stupidity of sheep and play into the hands of our fighting enemy. We should meet the seed of the Serpent with the cautiousness of serpents. Foreseeing danger, we should cover ourselves against the wolves that prey upon Jehovah’s flock. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 37</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">W  it is our desire to be well pleasing to Jehovah, then we must avail ourselves of every opportunity to grow in an accurate knowledge of his Word. In the early Christian congregation he provided apostles, prophets and missionaries to train the brothers for ministerial work, building them up in accurate knowledge so they would be equipped for the assignment. Now, too, he has considered the needs of his servants and supplied them with the sustenance of truth and an organization to help equip them for their assignment as ministers. “Be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will ... in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him.” (Col. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1:9, 10, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW) To</span><span class="font0"> fully please Jehovah thus we must apply ourselves to a careful study of his Word.

While in the world we are not part of it, nor can we live according to its moral code, wherein it winks at adultery and fornication and thinks it smart to be drunk. Forgetting and forsaking fine counsel that Jehovah has set forth in his Word, more and more persons have become delinquent. Also, more worried are each nation’s leaders concerning delinquency.

<p><span class="font0">Because of what dedication requires of one some hesitate to step forward and say to God: “Here I am! Send me.” And is it because you fear you might fail to meet the requirements? You may know of persons who made a dedication and then failed to live up to it. But could it be you merely think of such examples to justify postpouing your dedication? By nature you may be weak, always fearful of failing. By nature you may be a coward. But W  you ever hope to live in God’s new world you must strip off this spirit of fear and cowardice, for God's Word shows the destiny of cowards is second death. (Rev. 21:8) W  you exercise faith and dedicate yourself to Jehovah, then he will put his spirit of courage upon you. Instead, then, of looking at wrong examples, set by the halfhearted and by cowards, is it not much better to fix attention on the long line of faithful conquerors held before us in the Bible?

Of course, W  they do not know what they are doing, then they are not ready to take this vital step. The exact age as to when dedication is fitting cannot be stated. W  a child has sufficient knowledge of Jehovah and his righteous purposes and adheres faithfully to the upright principles set down in his Word, W  the child has reached the age of accountability and desires to make a dedication to Jehovah, it is in order for him to do so and it is then proper also to take the step of baptism by water. This essential and direct step toward life is necessary to gain the approval of Jehovah God.

And to this day the history of Jehovah’s witnesses is ever-new with like cases. Such outwitting of oppressors of the sheep is not a failure to render unto Caesar his things; it is a courageous, sensible way of rendering first “unto God the things that are God’s.” W  the wolfish enemy drives Jehovah’s people underground, as Saul drove David into caves, then their underground worship is not a work of deceit and lies because it is not done above ground under greedy eyes of the wolves.

<p><span class="font0">Satan’s challenge to Jehovah’s sovereignty and man’s failure to keep integrity did not disturb the Creator in the least. He at once decided to have a capital organization of 144,001 integrity-keepers. As the new heavens of the new world they will undo the works of Satan and restore peace on earth to men of good will. To select and test these integritykeepers has required a long period of time, in which the righteous and the wicked have lived side by side, the latter repeatedly reproaching the name of Jehovah by word and deed. On God’s part this required great patience and longsuft’er-ing; it required his refraining from immediately destroying the wicked. So also on the part of the integrity-keeping haters of evil, Jehovah’s witnesses; these have remained steadfast, immovable in their devotion to God.

W  those Christians in the new covenant come together to eat the Lord’s evening meal, doing so in remembrance of him, and they then partake of the emblems, the loaf and the cup of wine, then they are declaring that they arc partaking of the table of Jehovah and that they arc sharers with the altar of Jehovah. For this reason they have to be all for him. They cannot divide their worship and service. They cannot also participate in the sacrifices that the nations of this world (including Christendom) are offering to their many idols.

And there are very good reasons why God in these last days passed over all others and chose what at the time was a small and obscure group of people to speak in his name and by his authority as his witnesses. Whom else can God trust to speak for him? Certainly not the atheists who say there is neither a Jehovah God nor a Satan the Devil. He cannot use the pagans who have never heard of Him and who prefer to serve a multitude of false gods. Most certainly He will not use the selfseeking, proud and haughty world rulers who sneeringly ask: “Who is Jehovah?” Jehovah uses only those faithful to him, men and women of proved integrity, and for this reason he refuses to use the clergy of Christendom, since for selfish reasons they compromise with and are  friends of God’s very enemies. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> la</span></p>

A Christian will, therefore, not abuse his wife either physically or spiritually. If he does not help his wife and children to gain life in the new world, how could he be expected to help outsiders to do so? Jesus loves his bride, who is to be his wife.

It finally made this treasure available to people of all nations, so that anyone might take hold of it. When Jesus first offered it to Peter and Andrew they did not hesitate to accept it. As he had promised, Christ instructed them and made them fishers of men. They now concentrated their time and energies on the work of proclaiming the magnificent purposes of God. The apostle Paul was outstanding in this regard. He devoted all to the ministry. Although he underwent many severe trials, he never gave the slightest thought to quitting the full-time service. For a person lacking the proper evaluation of the treasure of full-time service the things Paul endured would have been good reasons for quitting. But not so with Paul.

Then God empowered his Son and used him to bring into existence all other creatures. Well, then, was this first creature God’s heavenly wife because God used him as his agent or instrument in creating all other things? No! He was God’s Son, and this in a way shared by no other creature. He was God’s “only-begotten Son&quot; in that he was the first and only one to whom God gave life directly, through no channel. As a Son and fellow worker he was one with God, never acting contrary to God. Because of being one with his heavenly Father he was always subject to him and never rebelled against his Father’s will. Thus, from the very beginning God’s only-begotten Son set the right example for all other of God’s creatures.

In that book we find in written form the good news from Jehovah, the God and Father of Jesus. Had Jesus turned farther back in the book to Isaiah 43: 10 he would have read : “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” (Ah’) Jesus himself has told us that he was and is the “faithful and true witness” of Jehovah, and it is only from God himself that we today get the truly good news.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 7:9, 10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God used his only-begotten Son in creating other creatures in heaven, and so as time went on a great host of angels were created, all of them sons of God because from him the power of life sprang. To all these God spoke by his only-begotten Son, he thus becoming the Word of God or God’s mouthpiece to them. They became God’s heavenly household and God organized them all under his only-begotten Son, that all together they might do the great Creator’s will, each one doing his assigned part. Thus God made them an organization, his heavenly universal organization, because it lives and operates throughout the universe. God married it to himself, binding it to himself in an unbreakable union as his co-worker and helper. With his faithful only-begotten Son as the leading one in it, God was sure that this organizational wife would be kept at one with him in loving devotion and submission. His heavenly organization thus sets an example for us. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span><span class="font0"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Gen. 1: 26, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By their claim of materialism and efforts to rule out Jehovah's Creatorship and Godship materialistic Bible-haters attempt to rule out virtue as well. In order to deny God they must deny high moral values; or, in order to deny high moral values they must deny the existence of God. Such denial is an impossibility. Were man not created in God’s likeness he would not find himself in a controversy involving virtue. The very fact that he does so find himself proves the existence of a virtuous God; otherwise virtues and the controversy involving them would never be. If man is the same as the lower animals, why does he have a vocabulary expressing thoughts of virtue, morality, integrity, faith, hope, loyalty, honesty and other qualities of worship? The existence of these qualities proves that God exists and that materialistic-minded men are wrong. We must turn away from such men without virtue, if we would have God’s approval and gain life. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 4, 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ten men shall take hold . . . of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we hare heard that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">God is with you.—Zech. 8: 23, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those out of the many nations see today that God is with us and they hasten to get to know more about his ways and escape his coming wrath at Armageddon. We are in the limelight so that those who escape from the nations and who are entreating God’s favor will know where to go. To take hold of the skirt means to appeal for instruction and protection. Hearing their appeal we must rush to their aid, for there is a great urgency today in this gathering and instruction work. These inhabitants of many cities move forward with briskness, eager to obtain knowledge of Jehovah’s way. All of us should therefore now take to heart the words “Let us go speedily”; yes, go continually to entreat Jehovah’s favor. This speedy work is for our salvation and the salvation of many more. It is a matter of great moment, and delay is dangerous. Are you doing your part? W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Those who wish to enjoy the gift of singleness plan and make provision to enjoy their singleness to the full, to get the greatest benefit out of it. This is not selfish. It is not depriving someone else of the opposite sex of a marriage due, but it is enjoying that to which they are entitled, while letting married couples enjoy that to which they are entitled. Primarily it is done to the pleasing and praise of God and in the interest of his kingdom by Christ. Such singleness is maintained in the interest of God’s cause, not by one’s being imprisoned in some monastery or convent, but by preaching the Kingdom tidings publicly and from house to house, and it wins God’s good pleasure and gains commendation from those who are dedicated to God. In Scripture the four daughters of Philip the missionary are favorably mentioned as “virgins, that prophesied.”—Acts 21:8, 9, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the hahit of some.—Heb. 10:</span><span class="font0"> 24, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">25, RS.</span></p>

The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> study is vital. All should study the lesson, attend, listen and comment and show friendliness toward all. The theocratic ministry school trains the congregation in what to say, how to word it, and how to deliver' it to others in ministerial service. Systematic Bible reading is a part of the course of study. The service meeting is another training session, specializing in instruction in house-to-house witnessing, delivering sermons at the door and conducting Bible studies inside the homes. No one deeply concerned about offering unblemished fruits of lips will miss the service meeting, nor the congregation book study held in private homes, where it is easy to get acquainted, comment, and assist one another to offer to God unblemished sacrifices of praise. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font0"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">But if the slave should insistently say, “I really love my master, my wife and my sons; I do not want to go out as one set free,” then . . . his master must pierce his ear through with an awl and he must be his slave to time indefinite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ex. 21: 5, 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One who has dedicated himself to Jehovah certainly is like this Hebrew slave who is willing to be a slave to time indefinite. As members of the New World society, this means for eternity. This is the right frame of mind for a Christian to be in. Always he should see himself in the slavelike position, eager to serve the Master, Jehovah, who has given him life and all its blessings. No one should ever want to be free from Jehovah to go his own way. Jehovah so loved the new world that he sent his only-begotten Son to this earth so that those on earth who choose to believe on him might have everlasting life. He arranged to purchase the human family. Should we refuse to recognize ourselves as slaves and come under this purchase price and choose to go our own Why,  it would mean death. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 18, 20a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">To guide us in his right and joyful Why,  for his own name’s sake, God thus lovingly admonishes us. We can prove that Satan’s accusation is false and that he is a liar only by keeping integrity. Only then can Jehovah judge us as worthy of his approval. Will you gladly offer yourself as proof by remaining true to God? Christ, our Exemplar, did; and he makes it possible for each one of us to do as he did. He loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God anointed him with the oil of gladness above his fellows. For the joy that was set before him Jesus endured the torture stake, despised the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. He made his Father’s heart glad; the Father made Jesus’ heart glad also. We likewise can have gladness by winning God’s approving judgment now through keeping integrity. Without his approval, however, there is no gladness. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lord.—I Cor.</span><span class="font0"> 7; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">39, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The accepting of bride money by an African Christian father from a worldling in order to marry a dedicated daughter to him is untheocratic. It endangers her eternal welfare, thus to put her in subjection to an undcdicated worldling. It disqualifies a brother at least for certain special privileges in the Christian congregation. He may not be excommunicated for this action, just as a parent elsewhere who allows a son or a daughter to marry a worldling may not be dis-fellowshiped nor even that one that thus marries outside the truth. But such persons are not good material for ministerial servants. Where sons or daughters have refused to be married off thus they have not failed to honor their father and mother, inasmuch as these have not shown themselves to be “in union with the Lord” in making a marriage alliance with the world. The resisting sons and daughters are trying to remain “in union with the Lord,” which is right. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15 </span><span class="font0">13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yes, nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law, and unless blood </span><span class="font0">is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">poured out no forgiveness lakes place.—Heb. 9:22,</span><span class="font0"> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah promised to do away with the old law covenant and provide a new covenant, by means of which he would forgive iniquity and remember sins no more. For this to he done legally required shed blood, as Paul shows above. So it was necessary for the blood of Jesus as a perfect human sacrifice to be poured out in order to release us from the condemnation of sins, a thing which animal sacrifices of the law covenant could not do. Since the new covenant promised God’s forgiveness of sins and since the wine in the cup pictured Jesus’ clean, perfect lifeblood necessary to that new covenant, Jesus rightly said: “This means my ‘blood of the covenant’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.” Only Christians who are taken into the new covenant and who thus become spiritual Israelites are  properly the ones entitled to drink of the cup of the Lord’s evening meal. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 25, 26</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It might be said that between the covers of our Bibles we have the captured sayings of the holy spirit. Truly, what an amazing treasure we hold in our hands when we take up the Holy Scriptures I As a practical suggestion for a personal Bible-reading program, why not read each morning from the Bible the entire chapter surrounding the day’s text? This will supply you immediately with rich supporting material for a stimulating study of the morning’s text and comments. Another suggestion would be to set aside a half hour a day for straight Bible reading. Either a half hour before breakfast when one’s mind is fresh or in the evening before going to bed, with the object, not just to cover a given budget of pages, but to absorb something of lasting value from what is read by seeking to retain one or more basic principles or points of divine counsel each day. Memorize those points and repeat them the next day. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font0"> 16, 18, 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Now I say to the single persons</span><span class="font0"> [rirpins] </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">and the widows, it is well for them that they remain even as I am. But if they do not hare self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion.—1 Cor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7:8, 9,</span><span class="font0"> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Married life has its joyous, satisfying privileges and these are a gift from God. Singleness, too, has its own peculiar privileges and opportunities and these are a gift from God. Which gift do you want? Those being almost consumed with passion did not have the cultivated gift of self-control that Jesus mentioned. Because of the prevalence of fornication it is better for those on afire with passion and distracted by its flames to give up their singleness or their widowhood and safeguard themselves against fornication by having a legal marriage mate. In harmony with this Paul wrote the younger widows in the congregation to avoid following Satan, indulging in fornication or a misuse of time and energy. by specializing on God’s direct service as far as possible. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 10-12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">11:3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though momentarily thrown off balance because of temptations to follow an unwise course, the heart condition of the well-entrenched, long-time servant of God is strong enough to right him immediately to resist such temptations. A strong heart condition also keeps one balanced against all storms of opposition and assures one of a proper, steady course of righteousness. Where Satan succeeds in planting doubt and wrong thinking in the minds of weakhearted ones, he keeps them deflected or off balance for a period of time, which results in serious spiritual sickness. Such spiritually sick ones need the services quickly of the true physicians, Jehovah and Christ, that they may be returned to healthy spiritual balance. Satan has ever sought to steal the minds of men that he might corrupt their hearts, leading them to certain spiritual death.

<p><span class="font0">Why,  </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">for that matter, I do indeed also consider all things to be loss on account of the excelling value of the knowledge of Christ.—Phil. 3: 8,</span><span class="font0"> NW.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No amount of hardship could cause Paul to let go of his treasure of full-time service. Neither did he permit the attraction of earthly possessions to change his set of values. He considered all that the world offered in a material way as loss when compared with the ministry and its life-giving truths. The things of this world, upon which people set their hearts, Paul considered to be refuse in comparison with the treasure of full-time service. Does it not seem foolish to place your heart upon a great deal of refuse and to make it your goal in life? Is it not foolhardy to make that your treasure? Since its evaluation is completely changed by our circumstances, is it not wiser to set our heart upon a treasure whose value never changes? A treasure that can mean eternal life? Now where is your heart? Is it where Jesus’ heart is, in the glorious treasure of full-time service? W  </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3/15 23, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jesus told us to pray for God’s kingdom by Christ to extend its power to this earth to break up the evil conditions here. And, looking forward with the vision of an inspired prophet and foreseeing the events of our generation since 1914, Jesus foretold the first world war with its accompanying woes. These are visible earthly proof that God’s kingdom has at last come into power and is ruling toward the earth. Then Jesus foretold the work of his followers at that time, which is our time. Was their work to be that of multiplying earth’s sorrows and crimes by engaging in world wars and in persecuting other religious people? No! Pointing ahead to a joyful, comforting work for his followers he said that the good news of the Kingdom would be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness. This witness to God's established kingdom we must urgently give before this old system of things ends completely in an Armageddon fight.

<p><span class="font0">The amazing thing is that after all the struggle to uphold the truth and live according to it, fighting off the attacks of Satan, we do not become weak and exhausted. All these trials work to our good to strengthen us spiritually, for the spiritual warfare is upbuilding, even as Paul shows in the words above. However, no one will receive the rewards of his fighting unless he continues faithful to the end, fighting the right fight and serving the faith. The final reward we look for is life itself, and nothing can compare with that, as it is the greatest reward of all. Even though we lose our life now as faithful witnesses, still we have the prospect of life in the new world through the resurrection. So contend for the victory in the right contest of faith.

His good manners sprang from a sincere heart and from his cultivating good habits and putting into practice from youth the righteous principles of God, especially his law of love.

But to become genuinely a part of the New<sup>7</sup> World society it is imperative that proper respect for theocratic arrangement and order be shown. A humble, obedient mental attitude is required. We cannot permit dispositions and trends of the old world to influence our thinking and acting once we have come into the New World organization.

<p><span class="font0">When Paul wrote these words it was nineteen centuries before the battle of Armageddon, which will be followed by marriage privileges for the other sheep of the Lord Jesus who survive the battle. Those Christians faithfully dying single back there did so without hope of any future human marriage on earth, because they hoped in a heavenly resurrection to be part in Christ’s bride above. And even though virginity back there had no thought of a mere postponing of marriage until Armageddon, Paul felt that those who did not marry were happier, “according to my opinion. I certainly think I also have God’s spirit.” So, “let him that can make room for it make room for it,” even as Jesus said.

<p><span class="font0">Teaching those who are targets of assault by the demons to pray to God through Christ is also a powerful means to keep the demons at a distance and to rout them. The mistake is oftentimes made of thinking God’s power insufficient to break the spell that a voo-dooist or other demonist may cast upon one and hence going to another agent of the demons, a witch doctor, to break the power of the spell. Thus the relieved person is obliged to thank the Devil and his demons rather than God Almighty for his deliverance. This glorifies the Devil’s organization rather than Jehovah; it gains, not divine favor, but disfavor, and indebts one to the Devil and weakens one’s defenses against him. Prayer, keeping one’s mind filled with the things of God and keeping regularly active in Jehovah’s service will break the enemy’s power and fortify one to resist his further assaults. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15 </span><span class="font0">33</span></p>

Not only must he meditate upon the marvelous blessings that God has promised for those who endure in faithful service, but he must reflect upon the splendid examples of steadfastness that can be found in the Bible. If persons of past ages could hold up under trials and discouraging circumstances, then we can too. They were just as human as we are. Remember Paul’s sound advice given above. Even if our preaching may seem to be fruitless, our labor is never in vain. Our daily service is a sacrifice of praise to Jehovah, and that alone is reason enough to be steadfast in fulltime service.

You cannot run in fits and starts. It is not just a burst of energy here and easing off there that wins. Do you think you can redeem your lagging behind by a spurt of activity for a while and then again slip away and let no one see you for weeks? You cannot. Sennacherib had the superior army and the strength, but it was the surrounded King Hezekiah that won. Why? Was he swift? Was he strong? No. He won because he had faith and submitted himself to Jehovah in prayer. In our fight also it is not just one blow that defeats the enemy. We must keep on striking many telling blows. So it cannot be just one set of scriptures or one sermon to use in the witness work.

Everlasting life is therefore an undesen ed gift from Jehovah, and he makes this gift available to any willing human, but only through Christ. The only way to win everlasting life is to accept it on the terms upon which God offers it; that is, by coming through Christ to Jehovah and willingly dedicating oneself to serve him now and forevermore. This dedication to God must be made voluntarily. It is a personal choice and no one can make it for another. It is not a choice to be made under coercion either. One should not make such a dedication just to keep peace in the family. No one is compelled to choose the only way that leads to life. The choice is each one’s personal responsibility.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Flee from fornication.—1 Cor. 6:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some seem to have difficulty in understanding why the sexual offenses should be so objectionable to the Christian organization and why they arc so strongly condemned by God himself in his Word. They argue that sexual offenses do no harm, not even to the willing participants themselves; so wherein is it so wrong? Lying, yes! Stealing, yes I Such things deprive another of what is his due. But an offense such as adultery or fornication, is it not different? Since it is so commonly practiced in the old world, how can it be so bad for the members of the New World society to practice? But it is the great Creator and Father who has made this provision for the transmission of human life, and this is a very wonderful and sacred thing. We have all received its benefits, because we are living. If we accept its benefits we, of course, accept God’s method, and the acceptance of the benefit and method by use makes it encumbent on us to accept God’s regulation of the entire process. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The single man is anxious for the things of the Lord, . . .

<p><span class="font0">This advice was of personal advantage to Christians nineteen centuries ago. It is no less of personal advantage to us now since the Kingdom was born and the time left for this old world’s time of the end has been reduced by more than forty years and not very much appears to be left. Remember that no free Christian is forbidden to marry, whether he is an overseer, a ministerial servant or just a preaching member of a congregation, a widower or a bachelor. Singleness is forced upon no Christian qualified for marriage. Whoever can muster enough selfcontrol and proper regulation of his life course as to hold back from marriage in this present wicked system of things, for the sake of God’s kingdom, may do so, crowding out other attractive things, that he may make room for this gift. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 14, 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">We have been given much in the way of Kingdom truths and privileges of giving them out to others. The rule laid down by Jesus shows that the truth brings with it great responsibility, which, if we are to be faithful and get life, must be performed in a right way. Jesus said: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator. Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit.” (John 15: 1, 2, .VIF) As the Vine, Christ directs the production of fruit to Jehovah’s praise, but the branches must bring forth Kingdom fruitage, or else be cut off as useless. Jehovah cleans and prunes his vinelike organization for the producing of Kingdom fruit. If we appreciate the illustration we shall work for a productive ministry, being concerned with not only quantity but also quality. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Exclusive devotion to Jehovah is a very serious requirement. “Exclusive” means keeping others out, or excluding. It means single or sole, or singly devoted. No one can be included in God’s position. He is exclusive. Everyone else stays outside this most honored position that he only can hold. He is alone in his exalted place in the universe. He will not include anyone else with himself. His glory he does not share with another. Christ appreciated the very exclusive position his Father held in the universe. He was not ambitious to be equal with God, but testified: “The Father is greater than I am.” Satan the Devil, however, chose to try to push Jehovah out of this exclusive position; and, of course, Satan has not given to Jehovah exclusive devotion, for he seriously considers being like the Most High. Clergymen who challenge God’s Word have the same proud spirit. But a person exclusively devoted to Jehovah is humble. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 7:35, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Christian that marries now in this time of the end because he feels the necessity does not sin. Likewise, the Christian that keeps his own virginity will do well. Yet the resulting privileges are different, which leads Paul to write: “Consequently, he also that gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that does not give it in marriage will do better.” A better course is also opeu to widows who could remarry. Though a widow is free to marry whom she wants, only in the Lord, “she is happier if she remains as she is,” not rebound to a new husband for as long as he lives. We can have faith that singleness is the better way, the happier way, because this counsel is the opinion of the apostle Paul, who certainly thought he also had God’s spirit at the time of writing this. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font0">18a</span></p>

It uplifted the meek. It bound up the broken hearts. It gave sight to the religiously blind. It released the ones crushed with this world’s oppression and enslavement and it comforted all that mourned because of bad religious conditions. The passing of nineteen hundred years has not lessened the goodness of that Kingdom message; it is still good news. But the goodness of the news is enlarged today because the long-awaited kingdom of God has been set up in the hands of his Son. It was set up at God’s throne in the heavens, where his Son has been sitting nineteen centuries at his right hand. It was set up A.D. 1914, the same year that the worldchanging first global war began.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In proportion as each one has received a gift, use it in ministering to one another as the right kind of stewards over God’s undeserved kindness which is expressed in various ways.—1 Pet. 4:10,</span><span class="font0"> AW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A steward is one who looks after or guards, having management of certain interests. Stewardship and responsibility go hand in hand. Having responsibility means being answerable for the discharge of a duty or trust; being accountable to a rightful superior ; being able to respond or answer for one’s conduct and obligation; being one who is trustworthy. Above, Peter expresses the close connection between stewardship and responsibility. God through Christ has entrusted great interests into the care of the true people of God in these last days. This is of utmost concern to all dedicated to his service. In handing these interests of the Kingdom into the custody of his slaves he expects increase. Approval for increase, disapproval for failure to increase, are definitely expressed in Jesus’ illustrations of the minas and the talents. There can be no standing still. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 1, 2, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">When committing adultery or fornicating a Christian sins against his own body. He is misusing it, contrary to his owner, Christ. The adulterous Christian also sins against his wife, who is properly one flesh with him. He is breaking unity with her, thus hurting himself, hating himself because he hates his wife whose flesh he rejects. An anointed Christian cannot take himself as a member of Christ’s body and make himself one flesh with an illegal person, for Jesus has no oneness with such an unclean person. Unless the Christian repents and reforms from his immoral course he shows he prefers union, not with Christ, hut with the immoral person, and hence he ceases to be in union with Christ. He is not one in spirit with Christ. He ceases to be part of the virgin class that is espoused to Christ. He is no witness of Jehovah, for God does not make adulterers or fornicators his witnesses. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">All mankind should be one! All mankind will yet be made one. Happy will be that time! It will mean far more than tying mankind together by means of travel and communication and by international alliances. Never before has mankind been more closely tied together by such means than now. Yet never was mankind more seriously divided than now. We talk of the “human family,” but we do not act like one. On every level of human society and in every field of activity and thought differences meet us, such as racial differences, national differences, language, money, social, traditional differences and others. The results of these have been so calamitous that they eloquently argue for the speedy making of all mankind one in a true way. The continuance and spread of division throughout the earth must end up later in only one grand result.

<p><span class="font0">When God caused Adam to sleep soundly and removed one of his ribs and used it as a base with which to build Adam’s wife he was not foreshadowing that his Son would be the second Adam and would fall asleep in death as a human sacrifice for his bride, the congregation of his 144,000 followers. Had God done this, it would have meant that he let himself foresee that Adam would sin by eating from the forbidden tree of the knowledge of good and bad. Thus God would have foreordained that Adam should break his law and come under the sentence of death and that Christ should die as a corresponding ransom to save his 144,000 followers from among Adam’s descendants that these might become a bridal organization, a wife to his Son in heaven. To have foreordained that Adam should sin would have made God responsible for Adam’s sin, whereas God is not responsible for sin and is not bound to make sacrificial atonement for it. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font0"> 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Because self-love is a basic law in nature the apostle Paul could use the above illustration. And there is nothing wrong for one to be interested in his own physical and spiritual welfare. False religious doctrines such as nirvana or character development to the extent where one becomes selfeffacing by deadening all desire, as taught by Buddhism and some false Christian sects, advocate error. Such are teachings contrary to human nature, doctrines that stand in conflict with this basic trait of self-love, which God originally and rightly planted within perfect man. It is the wise balance of love for God and love for self that prompts us to seek righteousness, and impels us to serve God with all our heart so that we may ultimately receive God’s smile of approval for everlasting life. “Keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”—Phil. 2 : 12, NW. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 10a</span></p>

After that she gave herself over to service full time at Jehovah’s blessed house. She died single, and that without the hope of enjoying married life in God’s new world after she is resurrected from the dead.

Rahab was under no oath in Jehovah’s name to tell the facts to the king’s officers and hence was not a false swearer or false witness. A faithful witness does not love a false oath. So he tells the truth. If he speaks at all he will tell the truth. To the extent that he chooses to talk he will state the truth. If for conscientious reasons he refuses to tell everything he will be willing to suffer the consequences if he be judged deserving of a penalty. He refuses to tell everything, not to escape punishment, but facing it for conscientious reasons.

God is outstanding and alone the Sovereign. Love goes directly to him without any other sharing of that love. That is exclusive devotion. And although loving our neighbors as we love ourselves takes in a greater sweep, embracing humankind, who in turn can love us, yet no one human becomes exclusive in this unselfishness on our part. Our love for neighbor can include all mankind. But as to the Creator, he alone claims and rightly is given exclusive devotion. Loving our neighbor as we individually love ourselves is proper, but not exclusive. We do not worship the neighbor, but just show love. With Jehovah our love involves worship, service, obedience ; and in this he tolerates no rivalry. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Adultery is unloving and is a breaking of God’s commandment. The adulterer is already married and yoked together as one flesh with his legal mate. But adultery is a putting apart what God has yoked together. The adulterer pulls away from his legal mate and makes himself one flesh with a third person. Three do not make one flesh, but two do become one flesh. A person’s being one flesh must be with only one other, not with two others or more. Having relations with one’s married mate does not take one away from membership in Christ’s body, for one’s wife is one’s flesh and one is uniting with what is one’s own. But when married Christians commit adultery or single Christians commit fornication, they do something of which God and Christ do not approve. They are taking their bodies that belong to Christ and becoming one flesh with a fornicator or a harlot. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 14, 15</span></p>

They do not complain, because the spirit of God is resting upon them. Neither repetition of lies nor any propaganda flood of falsehoods can erase the Word from their minds aud hearts. No brainwashing can quench their faith. We are not double-minded. With firmness and discretion we resist Satan’s browbeating methods. But strange as it may seem, we who have our physical freedom stand in greater danger than our thousands of imprisoned brothers. Can we let trifling things interfere? Do we slack the hand? Do we make excuses? There is ingathering work to be done, a battle to be won! So let us daily give praise to Jehovah and buy out the opportune time for ourselves, because the days are wicked.

<p><span class="font0">God gave all mankind just one common start in life, even as Paul shows above. Yes, under the skin we are all one. No matter where people live on earth, we are all alike as to body, although of a different skin color. Why? Because God the Creator started off mankind from just the one man Adam. This first man’s wife, Eve, God built up from a rib taken from Adam’s body. Is that a childish idea? No; for Jesus himself accepted it. We are all one flesh, all human, of the dust of this one earth upon which we live. At death we all return to its dust, the lighter-colored races as well as the darker-colored races, there being no absolute white. As one dies, so dies the other, both under one common curse of death, so that no race is superior to any other in this regard. We can all intermarry. By such marriage of any race or color -with any other come children, children not of mixed blood but of one blood, although through different family lines. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 16, 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">God’s servants are bound to have many obstacles and temptations come upon them. But did Christ allow such things to take the treasure of fulltime service away from him? His mind and heart were fixed upon one thing—faithfully serving Jehovah. He allowed nothing to interfere with that. There are persons today, however, who once were pioneers but who failed to keep this mental attitude. They allowed their part-time secular work to entice them into laying aside pioneering in order to take up full-time secular work. Now, where is their heart? Is it in doing God’s will or in doing their own will? Is their treasure material riches or fulltime service? Since we know that Satan accuses us of loving ourselves more than God, let us never give him grounds for that accusation. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font0">21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The setting up of God’s heavenly kingdom over this rebellious earth is deserving of a coronation song, a song to glorify the crowning of his Son as King. Ancient King David showed its fitness by composing and singing a coronation song when he had the Ark brought into Jerusalem and put in a tent near his palace. Under inspiration the psalmist adapted that same theme and composed a new psalm, which showed that a coronation song must be sung on a grand scale now following the setting up of God’s kingdom and his placing his Son on the heavenly throne in 1914. This Psalm 96 is known as one of the Coronation Psalms. The great enthronement and the glorious coronation have taken place in the resplendent courts of heaven, of which fact we have all the needed evidence since 1914. So the commands of that psalm to sing praise to Jehovah must now be carried out. Will you be singing that Coronation song today? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Baptism is of divine origin. Nineteen centuries ago the Messiah was about to appear. There was therefore need for repentance and a return to God on the part of the covenantbreaking Jews. As an open public testimony of this before witnesses John baptized those thus repenting. In due time Jesus came and requested John to baptize him. But Jesus was no sinner against the law covenant. Indeed, he was guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners, a fulfiller of the law, not a breaker of it. John recognized this fact and tried to prevent such baptizing of this holy one, but Jesus answered him in the words above. Jesus, having reached the age of thirty, now was dedicating himself without reservation to do Jehovah’s will henceforth and forever; and as a symbol of this Jesus found it very suitable and righteous that he be baptized.

<p><span class="font0">A basic principle in human nature is the attraction of the sexes to each other. God created man that way, male and female. They exist as counterparts of each other. This has been provided to carry out God’s divine interest to populate the earth. The attraction of the sexes gives rise to a wide variety of individual human interests. Some of such basic interests and their rights are to marry, to rear a family and to have a home. This also means that husband and wife have a mutual and exclusive right over each other. Where these individual human interests are pursued in a way of goodness a record of merit is established and a reward of genuine happiness is achieved. If a contrary course is followed, unhappiness results. No outsiders may invade the field of a man’s private interest as regards his proper marriage. As Jesus showed, at Matthew 19: 4-9, man must confine his sex interest to one mate. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 11a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7:14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the unbelieving one is still one flesh with the believer, the unbeliever for this reason alone gains some recognition from God. God considers their children, not as unclean, but as holy, and the believer will try to bring them up in true holiness that, at the age of understanding, they might of their own choice dedicate themselves to God through Christ. The unbeliever is not automatically made a saint or one of God’s holy ones, but the believing mate has dedicated everything to God and treats the unbeliever from that standpoint. The sanctified believer will accordingly treat the unbeliever as God would want it to be done, and that will be all toward aiding the unbeliever to see and accept the truth and also come into relationship with God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Gen. 2:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because the first woman was taken from the first man instead of being made a distinct creation, not only was she one flesh with him but also all the human family that sprang from them is one flesh. This fact made her man’s closest relative on earth. For this reason he should stick to her. God pronounced this bond of husband and wife to he the closest relationship of two humans on earth, heuce the husband should stay with the one to whom he is closest, his wife. Thousands of years later Jesus quoted these words in answering the Pharisees and Paul also quoted from them. A married man’s place, therefore, was to be, not with his parents, not with his gang, his men’s association or his social cluh, but with his closest partner, his wife. He was to stick to his wife, not send her back home to her father who gave her to him. He was to permit no one to get in between.

<p><span class="font0">In this world of disunity, is there today no oneness of men under the Creator of mankind? There is! Such oneness exists within the theocratic flock of Jehovah God. His flock are the people whom he addresses in his Word, saying: “Ye are my witnesses.” These witnesses are primarily a remnant of the anointed followers of Jesus Christ, who have a heavenly calling to reign with him on his heavenly throne for the blessing of all the families of the earth. In addition to these the Great Shepherd’s flock now includes hundreds of thousands of people from all the families of the earth. Jesus spoke of these as his “other sheep.” He said the time had to come, and it has come in our day, when he would gather these other sheep and bring them together with the remnant of his Kingdom joint heirs, and they would all be one flock under one shepherd. Still godly harmony continues among them. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 34</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 2:7, 8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Disfellowshiping is really an act of love on the part of God and Christ, on the part of the theocratic organization itself and on the part of the servants who take the action directly. This is so because it is done not in malice or unkindness but in obedience to God’s righteous laws. It is an act of faithfulness; failure to keep the organization clean would be unfaithfulness. It has a threefold purpose, (1) that of keeping clean the Christian congregation; (2) helping the offender, if possible, through this drastic means, should it be that he can be impressed with his error and duly repent of it before God; (3) it is in the interests of those who observe the action taken, both as to assuring them of the correctness of the theocratic organization and as a warning to them of the seriousness of deviation from proper conduct. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 17a</span></p>

If we are alone it is harder to keep our zeal for Jehovah hot. Together we can help warm over the cooled zeal of inactive ones. If we fall, we shall be unable to offer public sacrifices of praise to Jehovah. To avoid this calamity we must not forsake assembling together. Remember, a sheep away from the flock is a lost sheep. So do not overestimate your spiritual strength and think you can go it alone pursuing selfish interests, flouting the sound principle of assembling together. “The recluse seeks his own selfish interests ; he quarrels with every sound principle.”—Prov. 18:1, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">AT.

<p><span class="font0">If you are able to give God full-time service, why are you not doing so? Did you not mean it when you dedicated your life to him? Did you die to your own selfish course of life, or are you still putting it first? God’s service is not only to be done whenever we have spare time. If it is not of first importance to you, then you have not yet changed your set of values and been transformed from being fashioned after this present world. You do not as yet evaluate the treasure of full-time service above the riches of the world. To present yourself to God means to give yourself completely over to his service. It means devoting your time, energies, abilities and possessions to the doing of God’s will, not to doing your own will. This is a sacred service that is pleasing and acceptable to him. But to be this it must be done with your power of reason. You must fully understand what you are doing and why you are doing it. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 5a</span></p>

Yet there are many who take under consideration all the circumstances that have to do with them as Christians, and also the Kingdom service privileges that are set before them. They look ahead to see what the outcome of a certain course of action or a certain life relationship with another might be. They weigh the married state and its dues and limitations against the single state and its possibilities, all this with a regard for Jehovah’s precious treasure of service. After serious study of the matter they make an intelligent decision, a firm resolve, to stay as they are, single.

Though Adam had the feminine properties divided from him and embodied in his wife he was still left perfect; he was still in God’s image and likeness. Eve, with the female characteristics controlling in her, was likewise perfect, but she was one flesh with Adam. One flesh does not hurt itself; it does not fight itself. The two sexes are in reality just one flesh. They were to complement each other, the one to supply to the other what the other felt it needed, and vice versa.

<p><span class="font0">Inasmuch as the miraculous gifts of the spirit have passed away, we do not attempt to do miraculous works such as those religious workers of lawlessness do whom Christ will tell to get away from him because they do not act according to God’s law. In order to be crowned with God’s approval through Christ we must contend “according to the rules” ; we want to do what he has made lawful, namely, preach the good news of the Kingdom. (2 Tim. 2: 5, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font0"> Doing this work until this world’s end we are sure to have Christ class us as ‘workers of lawfulness’ and tell us to come near to him as those approved by his Father and worthy of being spared through Armageddon. We are living in the wicked day when we are especially ordered to stand firm in the full suit of armor against the onslaughts of the demons and to use the sword of the spirit against them by obeying God’s law and preaching the Kingdom good uews.—Eph. 6:11. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 34, 35</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The injunction to moral cleanliness that Paul gives in the words above and their context is equally binding upon all God’s servants, because his spirit is upon them as a group and as individuals. Other sins that are condemned, such as lying, stealing and teaching wrong doctrine, are sins outside one’s body, but the sins of adultery and fornication are sins against the individual’s own body, which should be used to glorify God. We cannot glorify God in this or in other matters if we refuse to be subject to the regulations that he laid down. All who have his spirit upon them dare not sin against their own bodies. Back in his time Paul made reference to what he called the prevalence of fornication. It is no less prevalent now. The critical times in which we are living demand exacting preservation of virtue of all who compose or hope to compose the New World society. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 20, 21a</span></p>

Did he let go of his wonderful treasure of full-time service just because people did not respond to his preaching? If you have embraced the treasure of fulltime service, do you cherish it enough that you could preach for forty or fifty years with no one responding to your preaching and yet not let go of this treasure? Could you go to an assignment, knowing in advance that not a single person will heed your warning message, and yet stay on that assignment for years without quitting? It takes determination, appreciation of Jehovah's service and real love for Him to do that. Jehovah’s servants, Noah and Jeremiah, had these qualities; do you?

<p><span class="font0">It was not a case of Eve’s taking the word and law of God in preference to the word of her husband. Rather it was a case of taking the serpent’s word in preference to the word of her husband in harmony with the word of Jehovah. Here were two witnesses, Jehovah himself and Adam, against the one false witness, the Serpent. In safe respect for her human head Eve should have said that she would first consult her husband and see whether he approved of eating the forbidden fruit contrary to God’s command, for he knew God better than she did. Rather than go over God’s law with him, Eve looked at the forbidden fruit from the new viewpoint presented to her by a beast. She let desire for it form in her. Her desire led her into temptation and induced her to take action, and thus sin was conceived. This conception of sin was bound to give birth to the death penalty. Eve was grossly deceived, but just the same it was a case of marriage insubordination. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Marriage has joys and blessings that God purposed it to have. By the attraction that he put into play between the sexes it is normal for man and woman to marry, not even leaving out Christians who are in the flesh. However, for Christians God's Word does not take the view of some tribes or peoples that a man has not reached his full estate unless he is married, so that, if he is not married, he is only half a man. To take this view means to downgrade Jesus Christ, for he died a virgin, a single man, at the age of thirty-three and a half years. He died unmarried according to his heavenly Father’s will. But by this course of self-control and obedience he wins a spiritual bride, a congregation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">144,</span><span class="font0">000 faithful followers who love him with a love surpassing that of a man for a woman, of a husband for a wife. This spiritual bride whom the Father unites to his Son in heavenly beauty and radiance is the only wife that Jehovah has authorized Jesus Christ to have. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Never has there been a man on earth like Jesus. For unknown ages he had been working in full harmony with his Father, and now, after becoming the man Jesus, he continued thus to work. His was a productive life, for the whole of his earthly ministry was devoted to witnessing about his Father and his Father’s kingdom. It was God’s will that he do so and he delighted to do Jehovah’s will. Also, Jesus had a keen sense for quality. What he did he did perfectly, for he was a perfect man. On earth his was the most outstanding example of love, compassion and patience. At the same time he was a bold, fearless proclaimer of Jehovah’s truth. He spoke with sincerity and conviction like none before him. The ones he chose to be his fellow workers were those of right heart, men he could train and did train to be productive witnesses like himself. To be a similarly productive witness should be the goal for which each member of the New World society should strive.

<p><span class="font0">The life-giving waters of truth that flow from the throne of God are refreshing and of them we delight to partake. True, some of it may be hard to grasp at first, even as Jesus’ apostles found some of his instruction at first difficult to understand. However, recognizing that Jesus offered the “sayings of everlasting life,” they stuck with him. When they failed to grasp the point of his teaching they did not lazily let it pass, but asked him to make the illustration plain to them. When we fail to get the full import of an argument in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> or when we do not grasp the meaning of a scripture, do we stay with it—even as 97-year-old Jacob wrestled all night with the angel to receive a blessing— and thus reap the blessing of increased understanding?

<p><span class="font0">Merely having our children with us at meetings is not enough. They must pay attention, listen and learn, and not play or draw pictures. They should be taught that there is a time for things other than play. It may require the rod of correction to impress the necessity of being quiet and paying attention, but when properly applied, kindly and yet firmly, it will be beneficial and will not need to be repeated often. Such discipline is not an indication of hatred on the part of the parents; in fact, an obedient child is generally very fond of a father and a mother who mete out discipline in the proper way. Children respect parents who enforce their words—with penalties if necessary—and who do not let their words die as mere idle threats. Jehovah disciplines those he loves; so should parents. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">This means all God’s commandments. Some persons want to choose which commandments they will keep. For example, one will say that it is not necessary to be baptized and symbolize his dedication. He feels that as long as he is associated with Jehovah’s witnesses he will gain Jehovah’s blessing and be taken into the new world of righteousness. He feels: ‘I don’t want to be tied up so tightly with any organization ; so I will not be baptized ; I'll go witnessing, but I’ll keep myself free.’ It is not a matter of being tied with an organization. Rather, if you want to live, it is a matter of giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah. Oue refusing to be baptized thinks baptism will obligate him and place greater responsibilities upon him. Remember, he already has the responsibility when he has the knowledge. If he wants life, he gives exclusive devotion to God; he keeps God’s commandments and he walks in the footsteps of Christ and gladly is baptized as an open, public confession of his dedication. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In the face of the truth and in the face of the pressing need for salvation, men today ought to orient themselves to the One Source of salvation by beginning to ascribe to God the things that persuade us that he is the Source of our salvation and the One worthy of our heartfelt worship. For the peoples to be able to make such ascriptions to Him there falls upon us the service of making Jehovah, his purpose and activities known to them, of telling them about his name and all it stands for, and of explaining to them his written Word and showing them how to worship this holy, strong and glorious God. Too great to dwell in earthly temples, he dwells by his spirit with his dedicated people. The greatest gift one can carry to Jehovah in loving appreciation and worship is the dedication of oneself to him through Jesus Christ. By this gift we show him we bow down to him in full submission as well as in adoration. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font0">8, 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 19:14, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After Armageddon the couples surviving will continue in their marital union. Others surviving in a different state, widowers, widows, virgin men and virgin women, will be privileged to marry. Whether there will be an imbalance between the available men and the available women need not worry us now. Marriage then will be regulated by the Everlasting Father, Jesus Christ. He will have redeemed his earthly children through Armageddon just as much as Jehovah redeemed the Israelites out of Egypt and through the Red Sea. As all those redeemed ones belonged to Jehovah, so all the Armageddon survivors will belong to their Redeemer Jesus Christ. As Everlasting Father to his earthly daughters he will give in marriage whomsoever of them he pleases to whomsoever he chooses.

<p><span class="font0">Why so? Because, having once known the Lord, he now fails to discern the body that the Lord offered in sacrifice. It is as if he said: “The table of Jehovah is contemptible,” and so the sacrifice upon it is not unblemished, perfect. It is approaching the guilty action of the unfaithful who have “trampled upon the Son of God and . . . esteemed as of ordinary value the blood of the covenant.” Such a one is heading for a death from which there is no sacrifice for willful sin to deliver him. So let him benefit by the corrective, disciplinary judgment that Jehovah gives him. Let him discern what he himself is, and reform. If he has been at fault, yet he should obey the command and eat the Lord’s evening meal, but do so discerning the Lord’s sacrificed body and asking forgiveness for his sin. Then let this celebration strengthen him to follow Christ’s steps more closely during the coming year.

Those who fear bow down before his majesty and awfulness. They tread before him gently and reverently, for Jehovah is dwelling with his beloved ones. Nothing can stop the onrush of truths, the manifestation of his judgments. The time has come at last for righteousness to be exalted and all the wicked to be dethroned.

<p><span class="font0">To accomplish our ministry thoroughly we must be properly equipped for it. That requires study of the truth, and to get it done we must set aside time for it just as we do for field service. Perhaps as you consider the great need for personal study, reading the Bible, etc., you feel that it just cannot all be done. As a servant you may feel that with service activity and servant’s duties, there is no time left for all this personal study. But why not consider all this as just another field of theocratic activity in which you want to take the lead and aid others? Remember, to be “qualified to teach” requires personal study on your part. Your good example will help others of the Lord’s sheep in the right way and will help them to acquire good habits, in service and study, as ministers of God.

<p><span class="font0">Some allow the cares and anxieties of this fast-moving, highly competitive, war-threatened world to weight them down and prevent them from giving exclusive devotion to Jehovah. Jesus’ parable foretold that some persons would readily accept the truth, allowing it to take root and sprout, but at the same time they would permit weeds to grow up, making them unfruitful. How much better it would be for such burdened ones to heed Jesus’ counsel and put Kingdom interests first, ahead of all other considerations in their lives, by making a dedication to Jehovah. (Matt. 6:25, 31-33) To worship Jehovah, that is, to be exclusively devoted to him, means to serve him as a willing slave serves his master. To serve means to obey, and those who obey Jehovah do so out of love for him. Love is, in fact, the sum and substance of the whole law and commandments of God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font0">9, 10</span></p>

More than a half million of such lovers of righteousness have already fled for safety in these comparatively few short years since this proclamation began. Here, then, is tangible evidence that the delivering of this message of warning has not been in vain, but rather has been attended by overwhelming prosperity and success. The Master Jehovah has smiled with approval upon his trustworthy witnesses and their work, and has indeed refreshed and sustained them over the years. No doubt a great multitude of other people of good will must yet hear and flee to safety as this proclamation continues a little longer. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 16a</span></p>

You should examine the requirements and decide if you are able to meet them. You should consider the cost. Is it too high for you? It is a decision you must make because of your love for God and your willingness to serve. You must have a genuine love for God and his service before you can even consider reaching out for this treasure. You must be keenly interested in the Kingdom ministry and in the expansion of the New World society. You should be mature in the Scriptural truths that come to you through God's organization.

<p><span class="font0">The Christian husband should sit with his wife in congregational meetings, he should study the Bible at home together with her and build up a oneness of spiritual interests with her. This may be difficult at first or unusual. But as he begins showing love in little ways of expressing it and notes the pleasure of his wife over it he will find that he likes it. It will become normal, natural for him to do so. He will grow in appreciation that this is a showing of the spirit of God, the fruitage of which is love. In turn, let the wife notice his little embarrassed ways of showing love for her and then let her reveal sincere pleasure at this and also voice appreciation of this, to enhance his happiness. The common possession of the truth and the likeness of their dedications to God and their hope of gaining life together everlastingly in the new world ought to provoke a sympathy and love between them.

Had he wanted quantity irrespective of quality, gathering his disciples would have been simple. Why, he could have had the whole Jewish nation at his feet; yes, more than that—the whole world, with peoples of all nations recognizing him as their sovereign. All he had to do was to submit himself to another production manager, Satan the Devil, instead of Jehovah God. But Jesus was not serving Satan but his Father. And in his production work, his Father had not only provided for quantity but also for quality. In fact, perfection marks all that the Creator ever docs. With him nothing has to be done over. There are no “seconds” or rejects. When he creates, the result is a finished product upon which no improvement can be made.

(Jude 4-10) No true Christian may have sex relations with any other than his marriage mate. Any other sex relations with the opposite sex naturally or with those of the same sex unnaturally are wicked, shocking and revolting. Such base practices are not a matter of private individual interest only, as some perverted ones claim, but since always two or more are involved in such acts these are at once a violation of the congregational interests of moral cleanness, requiring immediate disfellowshiping. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15 </span><span class="font0">13b</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 1:23, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After Armageddon all survivors will know Jehovah and give him their first love. Even today we must give him such love through the Son ; and that puts us in a unique relationship with our Creator, for ‘he is a God that wants to be loved uniquely,’ and “is looking for such kind to worship him.” That worship will be with spirit and truth, and it will be exclusive. There is no one else involved in this love and worship; hence it stands alone. And when one is so exclusively devoted, it suggests another unique relationship between the two, that of master and slave. Jehovah is the Master because he is the Creator, the Owner; and it is required of the creature or owned one to do the will of his Master. Jehovah is our exclusive and sole owner. He made us and he arranged for his Son to purchase us. That is why Paul could write: “Anyone in the Lord that was called a slave is the Lord’s freedman: likewise he that was called a free man is a slave of Christ.” —1 Cor. 7:22, AH'. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font0">14, 15a</span></p>

Love will make us keep all the rules. (John 14: 15) Realize there is no time to waste. Learn the rules well and how to apply them. Practice these things. All the rules must be complied with.

<p><span class="font0">Should one’s marriage mate in the course of time go insane or contract an incurable disease or a loathsome one, this is no true basis for getting a divorce. In this case the unfortunate mate must be treated just as an injured member of one’s body or as one's child. The mate should be treated with proper care, not be cut off from relationship by legal divorce. Despite the ailment the sick mate remains one flesh with the healthy one and deserves full attention and faithfulness as his own flesh. This displays love for one’s flesh and helps to lighten the terrible situation, rather than worsen it. The faithful mate will not forsake the other during illness either mental or physical. By God’s law the healthy one is not freed to do so. Naaman's wife was not freed from him because he was a leper, whose terrible disease only a miracle of Almighty God could cure. At a wedding the mates usually vow to take each other for better or for worse. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Yes, dedicated service to God is a personal choice for each one to make. So each one of those undedicated persons has today the same freedom to choose, a choice of life or death. If you deliberately refuse to dedicate yourself to Jehovah in this judgment day in which we now are living, your life will end at Armageddon if not before, and without even a hope of a resurrection. On the other hand, if you willingly dedicate your heart, mind, strength and substance to God and his kingdom, you will be choosing God’s way that leads to life everlasting. Thereby you will become one of more than six hundred thousand faithful dedicated slaves of Jehovah, who have his spirit of love and power and soundness of mind upon them; and who, as a result, are fear-free, undaunted, zealous, courageous fighters for truth and righteousness against great odds. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font0"> 18, 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A trap that our wily foe, Satan the Devil, is always ready to snare us with is entanglement with commercial interests because of love of what the present system of things offers.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah] is to be feared more than all other gods. For all the gods of the peoples are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">worthless gods.—Ps. 96:4, 5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Today everywhere on earth there exists fear in the hearts of the people. But this fear is not mixed with the fear of Jehovah. Besides fearing things they discern as about to come upon the earth, they fear their visible gods, the mighty ones that they idolize in politics, in business, in militarism and in popular religion. To these the people ascribe the power and works and adoration that belong only to the one living and true God, Jehovah. The fear that the people have toward these earthly gods is merely a fear of awesome men, mere human creatures who will die. But Jehovah is more to be feared than these mortal gods on earth. These gods can only violently kill one’s human body, but Jehovah is able to destroy one’s soul as well as body in everlasting death, from which there is no resurrection of the dead. (Matt. 10:28) How urgent it is to awaken the fear of Jehovah among those who want life! </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 4, 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">“Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over,” Paul tells those who would serve God. (Rom. 12 : 2, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font0">W) That means a person must reverse his set of values. Instead of looking upon material riches as the world does, he must look upon them as Paul did, as refuse. He will not give them the chief position in his life that he once did. What he now places the most value on is the service of the great Life-giver, Jehovah. In this way he ceases to be fashioned after this present system of things. He dedicates his life to the doing of God’s will as did Jesus, who said: Let “not my will, but yours take place.” (Luke 22 : 42, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW} </span><span class="font0">He also adopts the mental attitude expressed by David at Psalm 40: 8. He then engages in the Kingdom ministry along with others who have made this dedication. These dedicated ones now form a New World society of faithful witnesses who give testimony to the supremacy and purposes of Jehovah God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So difference of religion, either from before marriage or only since getting married, is no reason why a couple should separate. It is no basis for a divorce that would free them to marry others. If the husband should believe and come into God’s truth before his wife does, he should stick to his wife if his change of religion makes no difference with her or even if she objects. The thing is, Does she want to continue living with him under the circumstances, which his accepting the truth should really make better circumstances? If she does, then he should not leave her. His staying with her gives him the opportunity to talk the truth to her, or at least to live the truth before her, and possibly by his course help her to accept the truth and get salvation to life in God’s new world. This opportunity holds true also for the wife who believes the truth and still remains with her husband. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Never take an oath to do a thing and then prove false to it by failing to do what you swore to do. That means “swearing falsely in making covenants.” Shimei, who had cursed the fleeing King David, swore in Jehovah’s name to Solomon not to leave Jerusalem the rest of his days. When he proved false to his oath by leaving Jerusalem to recover two escaped slaves, he died with his blood upon his own head. Likewise Zedekiah acted a lie against the oath of Jehovah. This oath in Jehovah’s name he made before Nebuchadnezzar to guarantee that he would be obediently subject to his Babylonian overlord. After eight years of keeping this covenant he looked to Egypt for help and rebelled, thus despising the oath of Jehovah and suggesting that nothing could be guaranteed by Jehovah’s name. Zedekiah felt how Jehovah hated false oaths when his city fell, his sons were killed before his eyes, his own eyes were blinded and he was carried off captive to die in Babylon. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 47,</span><span class="font0"> 48</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">All Jehovah’s servants today must be alert to the wiles of the Devil. All should be aware and be able to recognize the subtle schemes of idolatry and concealed snares that may deliver us into the clutches of Satan. Failure to heed God’s Word ruined the children of Israel. Bad associations corrupt good morals, of youth and adults alike. Christian children of the King would consider it unimaginable to follow the course of false religion. But Satan is the god of this system of things and is therefore the god of false worship of any kind, and there are many varieties. Some worship science, others creatures and still others sensual pleasures. Deadly bait are all such injurious practices. Permitted to seep into the heart and mind of youth they weaken the strong and ensnare the weak and break down the walls of protection provided by the sure Word of God. Death is the penalty for worshiping false gods of any kind.

<p><span class="font0">With Armageddon coming on apace, the favorable time for salvation is now, not later.

So do not put off till tomorrow what should be done now when you appreciate what dedication means and what blessings it brings. If you have real faith and hope and are a person of good will toward God, and you have knowledge, understanding and appreciation of dedication, and if you are morally and Scrip-turally clean, then in the secret of your prayer you should solemnly vow to Jehovah God that you will henceforth and forever worship and serve him exclusively, and that you will do his will as set forth in his written Word, come what may.

Jehovah’s theocratic law, later stated to the nation of Israel, agreed with this. So Adam could have reproved Eve and let God be true and the Serpent the Devil a liar, thus vindicating himself as no party to her breaking of God’s law. God had appointed him head.

<p><span class="font0">This was to ensure the preservation of Jehovah’s worship without pollution and the keeping of his righteous commandments, thereby also preserving the qualities of virtue in general, Virtue has reference to moral practice or action con-formative to the standard of right, excellence and integrity of course, uprightness of conduct, rectitude, morality. It is an active quality, whether of physical or moral nature, of strength, courage and valor. It has reference to excellence of any kind, merit, worth, value, chastity, purity. Since the righteous God, Jehovah, is the author of all these virtuous elements, his worship is involved in them all, and a departure from his worship is a departure from all virtue.

<p><span class="font0">A marriage agent of the congregation cannot perform the marriage of a couple while they are disfellowshiped because of uncleanness. It is a spiritually curative step for the immoral couple to confess their sin to God and then to the congregation committee and express repentance and prove their repentance by refraining from further unclean relations between themselves and submit to the probation period and requirements that the committee imposes upon them before it can allow them a religious marriage. It is against good judgment, therefore, for parents to allow or even to encourage a daughter of fifteen or sixteen years to go a long distance from home and get a job and rent a room just to be near her boy friend, to whom she is engaged. Likewise parents should not allow a boy and a girl to take a vacation trip or a camping tour together for a week or two, as this puts them in the way of temptation that can and often does lead to fornication.

<p><span class="font0">When a Christian asks God's forgiveness for the course he has taken in unscripturally divorcing his mate it does not free him to remarry. His being forgiven his sins in general does not cancel or annul the legal marriage that was dissolved on unscriptural grounds. It does not change his married status. If it did, then the divorcer of another on unscriptural grounds would not be committing adultery by remarrying. Remember this: a marriage broken up by unscriptural divorce either before or after one dedicates oneself to God is not really dissolved in God’s sight by asking bis forgiveness of sins. Hence remarriage without Scriptural permission or authorization is adulterous and the congregation will disfellowship the offender. Likewise, if a Christian married a worldly person that was divorced on unscriptural grounds, that Christian is committing fornication and should be disfellowshiped.

The interests entrusted must be increased, even as Jesus indicated in his illustrations of the minus and talents. This is a rule of justice. Encouragement is to be given to the industrious. Those who go out of their way to do things should have their service privileges eularged. Those who work for increase God blesses, and gives increase to. The ones who are negligent and slothful lose what they have. Therefore we must treasure our service privileges with great care so that they increase. The reward for faithful, diligent service is greater responsibility.

Jehovah has no pleasure in those who make vows and then break them. Yes, baptism is a very serious act, linked with life, for it involves the making of a vow before God. Persons who are not true to their agreement are deserving of death. It is therefore proper for the minister talking to the candidates to ascertain that they appreciate that they are sinners needing salvation, that salvation comes only from God through Christ, and that on this basis they have unreservedly dedicated themselves to God to do his will as he reveals it to them through Christ and through the Bible under the enlightenment of the holy spirit. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 4, 16, 20, 21a</span></p>

And since the “slave” is directed by Jehovah’s will, rebellion against the slave is really rebellion against God. A proper mental attitude toward the slave’s direction is a part of keeping pace with the New World society. Obedience to and respect for theocratic representation are also a requirement in Jehovah’s organization. Jehovah is responsible for the organization of his creatures and delegates power and authority to these and directs what honor should be given them. Earthly overseers represent God in their assignment just as much as heavenly ones do. The respect that wives should have for their husbands demonstrates the need for order and respect within the Christian congregation for delegated authority. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">11,13a</span></p>

No one will drive us into this position or push us into the service of Jehovah. But of our study of His Word, our wanting to do Jehovah's will, it is our inclination, our preference, to be in full harmony with God and his purposes and to be his slave, even as Jesus was delighted to do the will of his Father. All who have thus dedicated their lives to Jehovah must realize that being a Christian is a serious thing. Nor should we think that because of our dedication God is now obligated to do everything for us. God certainly will carry out his part of the agreement in blessing and caring for us, but we must also carry out our part. We must show’ that we are obedient slaves.

<p><span class="font0">Marriage true and clean is a privilege from God. He himself arranged it, and “there is no unrighteousness in him.” Happy are the Christians that are faithful to the divinely imposed obligations of their marriage. They uphold the true dignity and honorableness of this divine institution. They take to heart the Christian commandment quoted above. They enjoy not primarily the pleasures of the fleshly relationship but chiefly the spiritual opportunities that this close union of the two sexes affords them. This fulfills the idealness of marriage and earns God’s approval and blessing. It makes wedlock a help toward gaining salvation and serving the Most High God. It vindicates Jehovah in lovingly instituting this provision for man’s joy and for fulfilling the divine purpose. So let husbands keep loving their wives as themselves and let wives have deep respect for their husbands.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.—Col. If: 6,</span><span class="font0"> Ml'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because his true followers by their example and by preaching would be an influence to preserve from moral decay, Jesus called them the salt of the earth. Salt is also mentioned in connection with their words of preaching. And just as Israel’s material sacrifices were salted so our words are to be seasoned with salt in that they are to be pure in truth, to have a preserving effect upon both the speaker and the hearer, and to be loyal and faithful to Jehovah, not despising his name or making his table appear contemptible. The words offered are to be appetizing to lovers of righteousness. And as salt is an appetizing seasoning in the food of both man and beast, so our word sacrifices are to be seasoned with spiritual salt, not being tasteless and insipid, but being appetizing, friendly, faithful and with preserving power.—Job 6:6; Isa. 30: 24, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">AT.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2:18, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The need that man feels to live in society is one of the primitive laws of nature from which flow our duties and rights, and the existence of society depends upon the respecting of the rights of all. That is why God provided Adam with a complement. No normal human desires to live as a hermit, alone by himself in a secluded spot. Rather, the warm friendship and the active association of our like-minded fellow men are keenly desired. Where developed in a wholesome way, such social interests bring joy and contentment. In harmony with these natural interests of sociability Jehovah’s witnesses today are being gathered into ever-wider circles of congregations taking a personal interest in their brothers as they form a remarkable New World society today in 160 different lands. .All righteously disposed sheeplike persons are being aided to see that it is to their best individual interest of present safety and future life to flee now to Jehovah’s New World society.

<p><span class="font0">You </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength [or, 'vital force].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Mark 12: 30, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That certainly leaves nothing out; and to love and serve Jehovah to that extent means nothing less than complete dedication to him. Can we imagine Jesus saying he was too busy with his carpenter duties to take on the responsibilities of dedication as Jehovah’s minister? Or can we picture him taking the attitude that preaching from house to house was beneath his dignity or that it required too much of his time and energy? No, Jesus not only preached dedication but he first of all dedicated himself to do Jehovah’s will. To be true Christians we must follow in the footsteps of Christ, even as to his very first step of making a dedication of himself to do the will of his Father. We cannot imagine the apostles making excuses and trying to postpone or dodge their following the dedicated footsteps of Jesus, can we? Not at all! Paul said: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.” W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span><span class="font0"> 10-12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">He began to say to them: “The harvest, indeed, is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”—Luke 10:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus likened our day to harvesttime, when there is much work to be done but not much time in which to do it. Today Jehovah, the Master of the harvest, has answered the above prayer of his anointed witnesses, the ones commissioned by him to preach the good news of his kingdom, by sending more than six hundred thousand workers earth-wide to aid in the ingathering of those in the world who are of good will toward God. In spite of this vast number, the harvest is still great and help is urgently needed. Shall we continue to petition Jehovah to send more? Yes, for Jehovah has blessed the productive efforts of his witnesses. That is how the number has risen to this amazing figure. That has been Jehovah’s answer in the past. So it will be in the future. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 3a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order that he may meet the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Tim. 2: //, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To be unnecessarily tied down to this old world dampens our spirits, impedes our progress and tends to destroy the joy we get from serving Jehovah. In fact, if old-world pursuits are not controlled, they will bring us to a dead stop. Each one should ask himself : Where do I stand in relation to the New World society? Am I neglecting New World interests for old world pursuits? Are my responses to theocratic calls like those of the faithful prophets and apostles? Or am I letting secular interests swallow up my time? We gain a hundredfold of all that we give up, and more. The anointed remnant will gain in addition thereto a glorious life in the heavens as Christ’s bride and the other sheep everlasting life on a paradise earth. All this for not losing faith, but believingly moving ahead with the New’ World society, in its journey to the new  world. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 16, 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bow down to Jehovah in holy adornment. Be in severe pangs because of him, all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 96: 9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our worship of Jehovah must be done in holy adornment. He cannot be worshiped in moral uncleanness. He cannot be worshiped by means of material or visual idols, to which a so-called relative worship is claimed to be given but which use of images makes one an unclean idolator in God’s sight. No; but he must be worshiped in a spiritual adornment that testifies that one loves, worships and serves Jehovah as the only true God; also that one accepts his Son Jesus as his now-reigning King and as the one High Priest who provided the ransom sacrifice to God to lift the divine condemnation from us and to free us from the power of sin and its penalty death; and, further, that one has accepted the privilege and responsibility of being a witness of Jehovah just as his Chief Son Jesus was. At Armageddon all those who refuse to worship Jehovah thus in holy adornment will be in severe pangs because of him. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">There are eunuchs that have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens.—Matt. 19:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, those who voluntarily remain virgins for the sake of God's kingdom Jesus called self-made eunuchs. Not that they make themselves eunuchs by physically castrating themselves, as did the religionist Origen, who produced the famous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hexapla</span><span class="font0"> edition of the “Old Testament” in the third century. They do it by making room for it in their hearts, willingly resolving to keep themselves physically in the state of singleness like that of a eunuch who could not marry. What keeps them from marrying is not necessarily a vow of celibacy nor self-castration or some physical disability, but is their overpowering desire to apply themselves to the service of God’s kingdom as fully as possible, and the more so now that the Kingdom was established in the heavens in 1914 and this good news of the Kingdom must be preached for the purpose of a witness because the complete end of this doomed world is constantly getting closer. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">By doing this our advancement will be manifest to all and we shall neither be inactive nor unfruitful in accurate knowledge and good works. Peter and John were able to give a bold witness because they had been with Jesus and learned of him. By his knowledge and the spirit with which he spoke Stephen confounded the enemies of the good news. Our Bible studies are upbuilding because those participating have studied. A public lecture about the Kingdom is inspiring and instructive because the speaker has devoted much thought and time to its preparation through study. The brothers came to the meeting to give, not just to receive. Sometimes a hostess spends much time preparing material food for a lecturer, but an extra-big meal is not required. Martha’s sister Mary, by choosing to take in spiritual knowledge, was commended by Jesus for having chosen the better part. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font0"> 8/15 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">God, Everlasting Father. —Isa. 9: 6, 7, AS.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark384"></a><span class="font0">When Jesus was on earth he did not get married. He was the perfect Son of God from heaven and he had not come to this earth to get married and become a human father, tied down to this earth. God had set before his Son a far grander fatherhood that would be of benefit to untold numbers of the human family, living and dead. When Jesus was born in Bethlehem, then what God had foretold about him began to come true, and God’s people on earth could take up the prophetic words above. By marrying a human bride and raising his own human family he could not become an Everlasting Father to us who are children of our first father Adam, who sinned and plunged us into death. Jesus came into that wonderful position of Everlasting Father because he did not get married on earth but, instead, put aside the opportunity of becoming the father of his own human family by laying down his human life for us. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 13:5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Good habits are not formed automatically. Good habits must be cultivated by hard work. And for the most part good habits are the result of diligent application of God’s Word. Bad habits will draw us away from the New World society. So check your habits. Ask yourself: How would Jesus have handled the matter demanding self-control? Copy his example. If about to enter upon a doubtful course, ask yourself: Will this course enrich or corrupt my appreciation of the Creator? What will happen if I let things develop to the fullest extent? Will the fruit be theocratic, or will it be detrimental to my spiritual welfare? So keep testing to see if you are in pace with the New World society by checking your mental attitude, your disposition, your conduct and your progress. Keep maturing not only onward with years in the truth, but also upward, as it were, in spirituality, appreciation, love and understanding. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">But why was eating the Lord’s evening meal not discontinued after the Lord Jesus came into his kingdom October, 1914, or at least after he came with Jehovah to the temple as “messenger of the covenant” in the spring of 1918? Well, at the time of either of those events Christ did not take his followers from their fleshly condition into his personal presence. He left them in the flesh and hence they were still “absent from the Lord.” So the remnant, while still absent from him because of their flesh, eat the Lord’s evening meal in remembrance of him from whom they are absent. If in this sense they are absent from him, then from this standpoint he has not come for them and turned the  mere remembrance into actual sight of him and presence with him in heaven. So the remnant of his body must keep on eating the Lord’s evening meal on earth until they are glorified, even after surviving Armageddon.

<p><span class="font0">In the Christian congregation all must sincerely wish to preserve Jehovah’s virtues among men. We must respect the decision of the servants in such a matter as disfellow-shiping. Our questioning it would be inconsistent with our profession of faith in God and in his Word and our profession of the desire to see it operate among his people. It would be inconsistent with our joining in the New World society in its wonderful work of expansion of clean worship. It would show a lack of trust, whereas our co-operation and conformance to the  disfellowshiping that was done in behalf of all is showing trust by all of us who are in fellowship. Therefore it is necessary that all in the congregation accept the policy of the congregation, even as Paul indicates above. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 22a</span></p>

More than ever the time is here for action, for the message of the hour to be pealed forth. Yes, Jehovah’s established government is a cause for universal rejoicing. It is the kingdom of salvation for both heaven and earth. The salvation already begun by it is the good news that the witnesses are commanded to tell from day to day. We are instructed not to miss a day in telling it. Why? Because the days to tell it are limited before Armageddon, in fact, are getting fewer with each passing day. Not a single day dare we leave it out of mind, for the kingdom of salvation is the thing that Jesus said we should keep seeking first, together with righteousness from God. Every day brings opportunities to tell of the salvation that it has brought and will bring, that others may be impelled to seek the Kingdom too.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">God.—James 4:8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such spiritually adulterous friendship with the world is no ground for divorce, because this mere friendship does not make anybody one flesh with one of the opposite sex adulter-ously. True, an unbeliever is a friend of this world. However, Paul did not argue from this that a believer had the right to leave the unbelieving mate. To the contrary, it was perfectly proper, and altogether moral, for them to keep living together if the unbeliever was agreeable to this. By this keeping together as a couple the unbeliever might be helped toward salvation in the new world, which help would not be possible if the two were said to be improperly living together and the believer was therefore said to be conniving at spiritual adultery by the worldling.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 2:13, 14 NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What brought the first human marriage under imperfect conditions? First of all, it was a failure to recognize the right relations that God had set up between the husband and the wife and their refusal to hold to those relations. Adam and Eve belonged to each other, just as a head and a body belong to each other. Adam taught Eve. Especially he told her how to live forever in Eden as the mother of a perfect human family by telling her the special commandment of God. And even as he had taught her that, it was his responsibility as head over her to enforce this life-protecting law. If he loved her he would enforce this law, because to do so would be also to love himself. And by this law enforcement Adam would specially love their Life-giver, whom they were to love more than themselves or each other. But both failed to put God first. Today many human marriages fail for the same reason. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font0"> 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Parents may argue that in applying the admonition of Jehovah in training their children to understand their proper place in the New World society, they have tried everything, but to no avail. But have they? Have they tried habit? How about the good habit of discussing the daily text each morning? Can you picture what a firm groove that would imbed in the child’s mind and how it would help to keep before the child the purposes of God? Then, too, how about a regular Bible study in the home for the benefit of the entire family? Does your family study </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> together some evening before the meeting? This also can become a good habit. How about the habit of regular meeting attendance? Being present at every </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> study can become such a strong habit that it will not be broken by light excuses.

<p><span class="font0">The journey to the new world calls for self-control. Moses, after serving diligently and faithfully for many years, did not enter the Promised Land, because at one time he allowed himself to be driven to anger and in a moment of rage failed to sanctify Jehovah in the eyes of Israel. Those traveling to the antitypical Promised Land must be on guard against losing self-control, which is moderation and self-discipline in all things. As we give up habits of the old world and  take up the habits of the new, we want to adopt a reasonable, sensible course in all we do. The wise man’s advice is: “Be not righteous overmuch, and do not make yourself overwise; why should you destroy yourself? Be not wicked overmuch, neither be a fool; why should you die before your time?” (Eccl. 7:16, 17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">RS)</span><span class="font0"> This means self-control, a knowledge of when to begin and when to end.

<p><span class="font0">The value of attending our meetings does not end with learning and coming to oneness of mind and improving our sacrifice of praise. There is a value from just the association together. There seems to be a concentration of God’s spirit there that buoys up our own spirits theocratically. Bad associations spoil useful habits, but good associations erase harmful habits and put good ones in their place. Scattered out in the seas of humanity alienated from Jehovah we are like tiny islands in constant danger of being worn down to the sea’s level by the endless surf, but when we come together we draw strength from one another to become a strong land impervious to the assuming seas. We take on fresh courage and fearlessness, renewing our strength to resist the world.

Because they are neither hot nor cold Christ will vomit them out of his mouth. (Rev. 3:14-16) Those running in the ancient Greek games knew it meant they had to put every ounce of strength into the contest. How about us? Do we put the race first in order to endure to the end? Jesus told us to seek first the Kingdom and God’s righteousness. Only by doing this can we win. Do not let anything—family, business, pleasure, desires, or anything else—intervene in the contest.

Those of mankind who have been toiling and slaving in the Devil’s organization and have made themselves slaves to it Jesus invites to leave their loaded-down condition and come to him and be refreshed. Jesus does not ask us to take the yoke upon ourselves and do all the work alone, but only to pull the same load and do the same thing that he did when he was upon earth. His assigned work was to preach to the lost sheep of Israel and get them in line for the blessings of God’s kingdom.

Even if his former, unscripturally divorced wife should die or remarry after he did, he must still repent, confess, make application for reinstatement and submit to the probation period. If the repentance bears the required fruitage of a proper fulfillment of his obligations in the new legal marriage and if then he is fully readmitted to the congregation, he is ever after disqualified from holding any official, exemplary responsible office or privilege in the congregation. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 41</span></p>

To walk with Jehovah is a blessed state, and God’s slaves are always happy in their service regardless of the assignment. The friendship of Jehovah must be sought after and prayed for, and attained by doing those things that will gain it. There is no better companion for a journey, and happy are those who realize God’s presence with them wherever they are, for then no place is lonely. He is with us in the severest trials, and even the loss of something or someone will make us cherish his fellowship more than ever before. If Jehovah is truly with us then he is just as near on land or sea, in any country or condition.

<p><span class="font0">A Christian bereaved of a mate by death may remarry but may choose not to do so, even as Paul recommends in the case of a Christian woman. Married Christians may still remain spiritually virgin toward Christ by not becoming adulterous friends toward this world and its womanlike systems : “These are the ones that did not defile themselves with women ; in fact, they are virgins.” With commendable virtue many Christians, virgins whether men or women, may choose to remain single, though making no vow to do so. They remain virgin, not because there is a Christian rule forbidding to marry in this time of the end, in these later periods of time. (1 Tim. 4:1-3, AW) The New World society has no such rule. It Scripturally allows freedom to marry before the battle of Armageddon. The powerful inducing reason foi' virginity is God’s kingdom. This overtowering reason why many Christians now stay single wins no reproach but high respect. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 3, 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Dispose of old-world ideas that God’s organization is filled with favorites. There are no favorites with God. If you fear him and do works of righteousness, then you are loved by him as much as anyone else. The servants in the congregation are chosen for their ability to serve. The congregation should show them the respect befitting their assignment, because they are God’s means of dealing wdth us and we with him. So do not weaken your theocratic relationship by stumbling over the flesh you may not personally like. If we are prone to look at any man according to the faulty flesh, that will tend to lessen our appreciation for his theocratic position, his responsibility as God’s slave. If we sec this principle of theocratic representation clearly, we will not insist on our own rights and interests, but will follow the wise counsel of Jehovah’s appointees. They will help us work out our salvation to the blessing of our fellow man and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

In the case of the fornicator in the Corinthian congregation, divine displeasure was brought for their failure to disfellow-ship until proper action saved the entire congregation from total rejection. When one pursues a course of badness with respect to congregational interests he commits a fault by which, if it is not properly dealt with, the whole congregation will become contaminated and accountable for God’s displeasure. The Bible illustration that a little yeast of badness will spoil the whole loaf or congregation is a true one. This requires the alert righteous-minded servants to be quick to preserve the cleanness of the congregation. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 13, 14b</span></p>

Some, however, who feel that they would gladly accept an angelic-delivered invitation to serve in God’s heavenly courts close their ears when full-time Kingdom ministry is mentioned. If they are willing to serve God full-time at one place in his universe, why should they be uninterested in serving him full time at some other place? Do they forget that when they made their dedication to God and symbolized it by water immersion they died to their former course of life? By going beneath the water they indicated that they had. When they came up they were to live from then on doing God’s will. If they are able to do so, do you not think God expects them to devote their full time to his ministry? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Since 1914 the one big, overwhelming and only thing that supplies us with the subject of a new song of gladness to Jehovah’s praise is the birth of his royal government, which he lays upon the shoulder of his long-waiting Son. Though it was promised about six thousand years ago, there has till 1914 been nothing in heaven or on earth like this kingdom of God. Never before 1914 has there been a capital organization over the entire universe, with Christ as its Head and with the Most High God dwelling in it and operating through it to have his will done throughout the universe. This is indeed something gloriously new, and it means blessing to all men of good will as well as to holy angels. A realization of this moves one to burst out in singing. It calls for a new song, with a theme entirely new, entirely different! Jehovah by his introducing his kingdom made this possible. To him and in his honor we must sing this new song every day as we have opportunity. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span><span class="font0"> 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Those who become eunuchs for the sake of God’s kingdom fill up the void that they might naturally feel because of not having a beloved mate by planning and striving to fill up their lives with all the service to God they can possibly render. Keeping thus fully occupied holds their hearts and their attention riveted on the urgent work now to be done in the short remaining time. This self-application rewards them with joys and blessings that counterbalance anything that their flesh might at times try to persuade them that they are missing by not being married to a Christian mate. Selfcontrol is one of the fruits of God’s spirit, one of the important things that every Christian must add to his knowledge, faith and virtue. So they specially cultivate the spirit’s fruitage of self-control in order to hold onto their singleness. They strengthen and fortify this specially directed selfcontrol by looking at the advantages they enjoy by this and the undesired things they avoid by this. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">How does integrity influence our relation to our brothers? God now gives special privileges and responsibilities to servants in a congregation who willingly take the lead in labor and in care of his sheep. Mature publishers can aid others in the house-to-house ministry, taking them along, showing them how to preach and training them to become fellow witnesses. Husbands too will remain true to their wives and wives to their husbands. Parents will similarly teach and train their children and children will obey their parents in union with the Lord. And how will our integrity affect our relation to the worldly? Our commission is to do good to all, to injure none. As far as possible our preaching and teaching work should be intensified as the world’s end draws near. This means to read from the Bible to the people in their homes, at their doors, wherever possible—outside and inside prison walls.

<p><span class="font0">To keep pace with the New World society means many things for us. It means a life of dedication to Jehovah as Jesus’ was and now is. It means for us to get rid of old-world habits and to conform ourselves to God’s requirements. It means to recognize the faithful and discreet slave and show due respect to those in authority. It means proving what we ourselves really are. If we do this we shall mature by God’s undeserved kindness. We shall become aware of the bountiful blessing it is to keep in step with his organization. We shall thrill in theocratic expansion. We shall glow with the spirit at the increase of knowledge and understanding. We shall reap with joy what we have sown. Our conviction will be strong, our faith immovable, our appreciation deep, and our joy will abound with full assurance that we are in step with the New World society of God, whose guidance will feed us well spiritually now and keep us alive on into the New World of righteousness and forevermore.

You can show such ones how to reflect the light of truth to those still in darkness and lead them into active combat with the sword of the spirit, holding high the torch of truth and light. To help personally to free some held in darkness by Satan’s spirit forces is the goal for each fighter for the new world ; and the rewards of sharing this prospect of life with others who love righteousness and peace are rich indeed. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font0">22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Having been hurled down to earth after the war in heaven, Satan and his demons have as their policy “Rule or ruin,” particularly with the ruin of Jehovah’s servants in mind. This has meant a constant fight by us with these wicked spirit forces at especially close range. Yet till now we have been able to “stand firm against the machinations of the Devil.” The full suit of armor from God and the wielding of the sword of the spirit, and the offering of prayer with supplication on every occasion have enabled us to make this unyielding stand and so to remain unhurt by the heavy concentration of demons now at this earth. (Eph. 6:11, 12, 17, 18, AW) We do not follow the demon-led kings of the entire earth to their battle lines at Armageddon. Rather we follow the Lamb as he goes to face all of Satan’s world at Armageddon. By our following him to that battle position we can triumph over the wicked spirit forces even now during this time of the end. At Armageddon we shall witness his own triumph over them.

They are stouthearted and courageous, having implicit trust in and reliance on the Divine Power that backs them up. The qualities displayed by them are the same as those possessed by Jehovah’s representatives in the past—upright men and women of action who through faith defeated kingdoms and who from a weak state were made powerful. But not in our own strength or through our own skill and ability do we come off more than conquerors. It is not because of natural strength of mind or body but by Jehovah’s spirit that we are able to endure the trials and sufferings that come upon us.

But then the believer must remain single until the departed unbeliever commits immorality and so provides grounds for proper divorce. The believer’s attitude toward the separated mate may be like that expressed in Laban’s words to Jacob: “Let Jehovah keep watch between me and you when we are situated unseen the one from the other.” (Gen. 31: 49, AS.) God watches whether there is any violation of the marriage covenant.

Everyone is interested in himself; many are not deeply interested in others. In the sermon on the mount Jesus considered the everyday anxieties that were troubling people, what they would eat and drink and wear. He showed that God knows these things are needed and will supply them to humans, just as he does for birds and even vegetation, and so they should seek first God’s kingdom.

We should show the willingness of the prophet Isaiah, who said : “Here am I; send me.” (Isa. 6:8, /IS) A person with this mental attitude is eager to do Jehovah’s will, and he will not hesitate to accept greater privileges of service when they are offered him, such as those of a pioneer publisher. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Sociability being one of the basic principles in human nature, man has always desired to live in social groups. This has enabled him to enjoy fellowship and to share in joint enterprises where combined interests are undertaken for the common advancement. This has meant that each individual man has had to give up some of his time spent for personal interests to undertake community interests. In sacrificing some of his own freedom of action in exchange for community responsibilities the individual receives collective benefits that lead to greater happiness than if he operated by himself. In the words above the Bible supports this principle of working together for the greater good. And that is why the apostle Paul counseled: “Have the same love, being joined together in soul, . . . keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”—Phil. 2 : 2, 4, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

The Bible is indeed our basic source of truth. It sets forth principles of the government we represent. It was written under the inspiring power of God’s holy spirit. By our mind’s taking in this spiritual information we become spiritually-minded and guided. Was it unreasonable for God to require Joshua to read from the Biblical law every day? Surely not. Then it is also well for each of us to feed daily upon God’s spiritual word of truth, that we may maintain a wholesome level of spiritual-mindedness.

<p><span class="font0">In view of this, consider: Is Jehovah’s judgment for integrity-keeping worthwhile? All breakers of integrity have come to a sad end. You would not want to be judged as having followed their steps, would you? Contrast, then, the Scriptural examples of integritykeepers with the examples of integrity-breakers: Abel, who died for the cause of pure worship, will be resurrected; but Satan, who originated false worship, will be destroyed. Enoch by faith walked with God; but Adam, who heard God’s voice, deserted Jehovah’s way. Abraham was obedient under a great test; but King Saul was disobedient even in a little thing. Let none of us become blameworthy as breakers of integrity and reap God’s death penalty for covenant breakers. Rather, let us hold dear the glorious treasure of service, ever keeping in mind that Jehovah will judge us according to our righteousness and integrity.

<p><span class="font0">Christ limited the grounds for a divorce that frees one for remarriage to adultery. This does not give cither mate the allowance to abuse or neglect the other. Rather it only emphasizes that they are one flesh, and should stick together in mutual care, come better or come worse. This is the decree of the infallible Judge of the Supreme Marriage Court. In some lands the law does not make the adulterous conduct of the husband a legal ground for the wife to divorce him, but makes only the morally loose wife the one that can be divorced for adultery. But according to God’s Word, if the husband is immoral a woman can put him away legally and free herself for remarriage without thereby becoming an adulteress. Jesus did not set up for husbands a standard different from that for wives. God is not partial. To him adultery by the husband is just as bad as that by the wife.

<p><span class="font0">In reading the life of Christ we do find that he was a mild-tempered person, lowly in heart; and all those who came to him found refreshment for their souls. The sick, on being helped, were eager to tell what happened; and, as for his immediate followers, the only responsibility he placed on them was to preach, to talk to others and bring them comfort. He told them to go from house to house, from city to city and from country to country. And this great expansion work of going to non-Jews from country to country began seven years after Jesus began his preaching. First of all, the Jews were given the full opportunity to hear the message ; and this message was presented in a most simple manner, merely by a speaking program. Certainly that yoke was kindly. The same is true today. It is not a heavy load that we are asked to carry, merely to preach. IV </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font0"> 3b</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A short period of time remains before Armageddon. During this period the opportunity offers itself to bring as many people of good will as possible into the saved condition that Jehovah now provides. We need to put forth the greatest efforts possible before the period expires to inform the people everywhere that their everlasting salvation can come only from Jehovah the great Savior. He must be made known if there is to be any salvation. He will be made known to all alive, even as he has sworn. (Num. 14:21) Those who refuse to know him now in friendship will be obliged to know his destructive power at Armageddon, which will fill out the knowledge of him that his witnesses on earth have been trying hard to give to the people during this generation. More and more we are learning to know how great Jehovah is. With our growth in knowledge we appreciate more that he is very much to be praised. Truly there is everything about him to be praised.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font0"> one’s mate commits adultery one has the right to forgive and not sue for divorce, provided the guilty one shows proper repentance and earnestly asks for forgiveness and promises not to repeat but be faithful to the marriage vow. If the innocent one does not forgive the offending mate, then the offender must be disfellow-shiped by the congregation and the innocent mate is authorized by the Bible to get a legal divorce if possible or desired. This is a private matter. If, say, the husband forgives the wife, he continues to give her the marriage due, trusting in God to forgive her. Then there is no reason for the wife, whom he treats as one flesh with him, to be exposed and punished by the Christian congregation with disfellowshiping, thus undoing the reunion that the husband’s forgiveness has mercifully brought about. “Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses.”-Prov. 10: 12, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">RS. </span><span class="font0">W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">10/1</span><span class="font0"> 30</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Serpentlike caution is to be exercised only while the sheep arc among wolves or in contact with them. Jesus did not advise this among the congregation of Jehovah’s people, for all of these are sheep. So the above is as much the rule of spiritual Israel today as it was for natural Israel of old. Jehovah’s prophetic instructions for us arc : &quot;Speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor.’’ (Zech. 8:16. 48) Being under no necessity to outwit or use strategy toward our sheeplike brothers to lead them off the track, we need not put on a pretense to cover up proper conduct. Peter once put on a pretense before the brothers at Antioch, Syria. Privately he lived the same as any non-Jewish Christian but publicly he acted like a Christian according to Jewish practice for fear of being criticized by Christian visitors from Jerusalem. The apostle Paul rebuked him for not acting truthfully but acting outwardly in support of wrong doctrine and practice.

By God’s undeserved kindness his witnesses have succeeded in becoming free from Satan’s paralyzing religious control, having gone to the right doctors for help. Have they become spiritually whole overnight? No! Rather it has taken them years to make their minds over and to fortify their hearts with truth. This has been necessary to overcome the poison of false religion that has saturated their minds and hearts. Years of spiritual healing have been involved, necessitating years of study and spiritual refreshment under the guiding direction of these master physicians. It is a continuous healing program that leads from one progressive spiritual position to another still higher on to spiritual perfection in the new world after Armageddon.

<p><span class="font0">Temptations will still come to those who are faithful stewards of Jehovah. Even though conscious of his blessing we are not immune from dangers and therefore must always walk in the fear of Jehovah. So when confronted with temptation, flee from it, for if you try to reason it may mean you will lose the battle. Flight is the safe way. Do so in haste, as when running from a poisonous snake;—get out of danger. That is what Joseph did when a dreadful experience came into his life. He got protection in his instant recognition of the fact that the suggestion was “actually sin against God.” The fear of Jehovah will likewise be our safety. Do not sin against God. No one goes extremely wicked all at once, but, rather, gradually weakens. On the other hand, by the fear of Jehovah one departs from evil and is safe.—Gen. 39: 6-9, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW. W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 9</span></p>

Remember, if you are not actively for Christ you are against him and must face the fate of his enemies. Have you wandered off the racecourse into the mire of inactivity? Take hold of yourself and swing back quickly! The most thrilling and final of all contests, Armageddon, is just ahead. By our activity let us all put up a hard fight for the faith.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Gal. 6: 9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you have made the fulltime service your treasure and have placed your heart upon it, then you will want to be in that service. But keep in mind that it is not something that can be jumped into just because you are momentarily stirred up. It is a valuable treasure that cannot be taken lightly. And once you have taken this forward step, you should not step back. The fulltime service is not a temporary occupation. It is not something to be done for a few months or a few years and then dropped when you are tired of it. Those faithful persons who took up this service in ages past clung to it in spite of discouragement or hardships. Once they entered full-time service they stayed in it. The Kingdom ministry today is no easier than the assignments they had. It has many hardships. So do not enter it with the idea that it is easy and then quit when you find that it is not.

<p><span class="font0">Jesus was not invited to officiate at the marriage in Cana, nor did he ever commission his apostles or evangelists to solemnize anybody’s marriage. Is a religious marriage strictly necessary? No. Is a civil marriage authorized by God’s Word? Yes, and in this regard we may give Caesar’s things to Caesar. Where a civil marriage is either allowed or absolutely required, no social or religious stigma rightfully attaches to it, and the Most High recognizes the civil marriage of his dedicated people and holds them bound by it. In some lands the governments recognize marriages performed by ministers of the various religions, and along with these are the appointed ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses. These are licensed to perform marriages. Where we do not have authorized ministers of our own to officiate at a marriage we can conscientiously go to the appointed government offices and have a valid, divinely recognized marriage performed by a state officer.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">10, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While money is a defense Christian parents should instill in the minds of their children true values, namely: ‘Knowledge does more good than money, it safeguards a man’s life.’ Since children will be of the same understanding as their parents, theocratic parents will have the proper perspective in gathering wealth, being sure that it is always in subjection to the important thing in one’s life, the ministry. Money should be a means to an end, rather than an objective in life. Parents can do severe injury to children if they are too liberal with allowances, giving them too much to spend. Children need to be restrained in this regard for their own good, so as to learn to value money and to handle it wisely. It is not the possession of money that is necessarily evil, but the concern and esteem that one places upon its possession, causing one to be led astray. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 12, 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">11: 19, 18, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus taught that the true religion was nonmaterialistic, that it was the worshiping of God “with spirit and truth.” Such true religion is actually an ever-expanding intelligent worship of Jehovah as guided by. his holy spirit. The true religion is based on a series of heaven-originated communications of truth that have been made known and recorded from Adam’s time to that of the apostle John. These communications from heaven make an appeal to the inind and heart of the true worshiper and hence are essentially spiritual. Therefore the one complete religion progressively revealed through the entire Bible makes up the true religion today. To be up to date on the true religion one must keep up with the expansion of true religion and be familiar with all its steps of development. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2:9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While it was Jehovah’s purpose to effect deliverance in vindication of his name, yet as far as individual men were concerned, each had to take action definitely proving he had the qualities of virtue. If they did not do this they would not be exerting themselves on Jehovah’s side of the issue. A course of unrighteousness is a denial of righteousness and therefore a denial of the righteous God, and merits cutting off. Those surviving the Flood upheld those things that God approved. A like course of action today constitutes worship of Jehovah, the exercise of virtue involving the basic attribute of love and including keeping of integrity, faith in God’s Word, sure hope in his promises, loyalty to him and his cause, honesty before him and before man, morality in things personal and public.

<p><span class="font0">After the death of the apostles productive witnessing all but died out. But that did not mean its total end, for God’s Word testified to a period of productive witnessing on a global scale in the future. Jesus had said that the Kingdom good news must be preached world-wide; and that over the Kingdom issue the people of all nations must become separated as sheep and goats. Further, these sheep gathered out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues must become a great crowd which no man can number; yes, the little one will become a thousand, all amid boundless spiritual prosperity. That then-future time has arrived. For us now these things and more are actually taking place.

Our endeavor should be to train others to join us in telling it. What will happen if we tell the good news of Jehovah’s salvation the seven days of each week during 1957? Surely this: many more ears will be reached with the joyful sound ; many ears, long deaf for never having heard, are going to be opened by the good news’ at last reaching them. Comfort is going to be brought to many sad hearts that would like to hear a truly cheering song with a happy theme. More persons of good will may thus be brought into the saved condition and more will be given theocratic training to sing and tell it out. As a blessed result of all this taking place before Armageddon, Jehovah God will become more widely known, more appreciated, believed in, accepted, worshiped, praised and served.

This is necessary that corruptness, indecency of any kind, not be allowed to creep in and contaminate. At times they must do this by dis-fellowshiping an offender from the congregation, which is accomplished by the mature judgment and considered action of the appointed servants. This is their responsibility.

<p><span class="font0">Jesus also referred to our productive witnessing as bearing fruit, Kingdom fruit. This is especially so now, the establishing of the Kingdom in our day already having taken place. Like seed, said Jesus, the Kingdom message when sown on good soil sprouts, matures and produces fruit. It is Jehovah’s law that fruit be borne after its kind ; therefore we should bear the same fruit that is sown in us, namely, the fruit of the Kingdom, its message. Jesus climaxed the counsel about being fruitful when he said to his disciples: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit.” Note he said “much fruit.” This forcefully draws to our attention that Jehovah requires us to be productive witnesses, accomplishing much through preaching, locating persons of good will, feeding them and bringing them to maturity so that they likewise will see their privilege of bearing Kingdom fruit. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Behaving worthily includes avoiding the works of the flesh, such as fornication, adultery, spiritism, jealousy, anger and drunkenness, for we are warned that those who practice such things will never inherit God’s kingdom. Christians must shun such things and must demonstrate instead the fruitage of God’s spirit. We cannot be witnesses in name only, but must hold to faith and a good conscience, which means a conscience trained in line with God’s Word. While our conduct may appear proper in the sight of our friends, we must remember that God discerns the secret intents of the heart. At the time of our dedication to Jehovah we not only vowed to put away the filth of the flesh but we also made request for a good conscience toward God.

<p><span class="font0">The heart is the seat of love and affection, hence of motive, and the center of direction and drive. By meditation, study and reflection on the part of the mind or by constant outside influence and association the heart is affected. It is the long-term development of this state of one’s affections that is described as one’s heart condition. For this reason a person can develop a good heart condition or a bad one. And just as our literal heart receives blood and then sends it out, so our seat of affection keeps receiving thoughts and impressions from the mind and nervous system. In reverse direction almost constantly feelings and expressions of love or hate flow outward from this inner depth to reflect the real personality inside. Truly, then, out of our heart the issues of life flow, because the very outcome of our existence results from the expressions of this heart. Hence if we want life we have to watch the seat of affection and keep it spiritually healthy. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

To his disciples Jesus, the perfect Example, said : “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and follow me continually.” Jesus’ apostle Peter did that; hence he was able to write: “Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely.” Not only do we have Jesus as a model but now he is invisibly present, directing the work of productive witnessing. Therefore those who are witnesses today must show good results in the ministry. The fact that A.D. 1914 the Kingdom was established on its heavenly throne is good news indeed. This good news carries with it the factor of productivity, for those who hear are privileged and obliged to pass on what they hear to others, even as foretold at Revelation 22: 17.

They know by experience that Jesus’ words are true: “My load is light.” They also know that if they take up this load and get under the yoke with Jesus Christ they are going headlong into opposition from the Devil’s organization. But despite the opposer’s activity, they had in 1956 the grandest field service report ever offered in honor of Jehovah’s name and in defense of his Word.

If those visible heavens beneath are so impressive and splendid and beautiful to us, what dignity and splendor must be all about Jehovah himself in the spiritual heavens ! What strength and beauty there must be where he personally dwells! This we can only weakly imagine on the basis of things visible, although we cannot actually know how glorious he himself is, for no man can see God and live.

If, now, Jesus cast out demons by means of Satan their ruler, then Satan was indeed divided against himself, for he was using his worst enemy on earth to cast out demons, not in support of the Devil’s side, but in support of God’s side. The case is different, however, when spirit mediums and other false religionists cast out demons or perform other kinds of healing by means of the ruler of the demons. In that case Satan is using those who are on his side and teaching his doctrines, and his use of them to cast out demons works to the support of his false teachings and demonic kingdom. By using them he is not divided against himself, but by this seemingly good work of undoing the case of demon obsession for which he himself is responsible “Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,” to advance his power and influence over the deceived.

You were the ones to whom God first revealed these truths and whom he first taught to sing this new song. He foreordained that there would be 144,000 of you spiritual Israelites to be associated with Christ in his heavenly kingdom. Today only a small remnant are still on earth. But all the 144,000, both of the remnant yet on earth and the triumphant resurrected Kingdom heirs, are singing Jehovah’s praise, all co-cperating together visibly and invisibly in making known the wonderful new facts of universal history. In obedience to the command of Psalm 96: 1-3 the remnant who have learned the song act like a faithful and discreet slave class and sing forth the new song. All others on earth who want to join in must learn this entirely new and different song from them. A great crowd is today doing this very thing.

<p><span class="font0">Our responsibility to communicate the Kingdom message is the important thing. Each producer is merely the vessel containing the seeds of truth. Unitedly we are used by the great Sower, Christ, to scatter seeds. As individuals we are relatively unimportant. We must always keep this in mind, seeking always to magnify the truth and its great Giver, Jehovah. True, each contact with good-will persons is important. We must be diligent to revisit their homes, to water the seed of truth until it sprouts and continue to cultivate the planting so that progress to maturity may result. Even so, “we are good-for-nothing slaves.” We can bring nothing to our Master but love and praise. So, having nothing to boast of save having the truth, which was freely given to us through God’s undeserved kindness, we humbly labor on. Remaining humble, giving praise to Jehovah and unitedly magnifying him before others, as skillful workers, we prosper. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1 </span><span class="font0">8a</span></p>

(Hos. 4:6) The lifesaving knowledge is at hand for you in the New World society, which alone today offers the hope of living through Armageddon into God’s new world. Accept this good news gladly; prove that it is God’s truth; attend the meetings of the witnesses; study the Bible and learn more of its glorious, hope-inspiring truths. Let them transform your mind. Make them your own. Let them alter your living for everlasting life in the new world. Set your hope on God’s promise and stick by it. Dedicate yourself to be one with him the Creator. Serve and obey him as ruler rather than worldly men. Continue, then, in the way that you now find yourself in by reading this message. Keep at one with the unbreakably united New World society of the Creator’s witnesses. With them love and serve him now, when he by Jesus Christ is beginning to ‘make all obedient mankind one under their Creator.’ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 43-45</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A rule of running is that the runner must not look back as he runs. Some today run well for a while. But later they begin to feel they are missing something and so look behind. Selfish considerations cause them to fall out of the race of integrity-keeping. Fighting in a contest is also mentioned by Paul. A rule for those participating in a boxing match or test of combat is fearlessness. We must be fearless in witnessing, confident of our spiritual strength and of handling God’s Word aright. Remember, preach and be opposed ! When opposed, what will you do? Will you be afraid and quit? If so, you will be disqualified and put out of the contest. And still another rule is to keep one’s eyes on the foe. Failure to do so entraps many today. Looking for dictators, mobs, etc., they overlook their real adversary, who is invisible to human eyes. So “keep your senses, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” —1 Pet. 5:8, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font0">In the Christian congregation we have an organization permanently devoted to carrying out God’s purposes, and the only one that preserves his virtues in the earth. Jesus referred to Christians as a preservative of human life, of God’s worship and of virtue when he said the above words. This salt, now seen in the New World society, has responsibilities that it cannot avoid, to the end that God's righteousness will be upheld, which privilege and obligation fall upon all who engage in Christian worship. Christians, novices and experienced alike, must be kept within the bounds of Christian propriety and operate on theocratic principles ; otherwise, corruption would interfere with the triumph of the Christian congregation in its God-appointed tasks. Care and oversight of the respective congregations require the Christian overseers to see that the congregation walks in the paths of virtue. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 1-3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 96:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although the majority of this generation have rejected the witness now being given, the preaching of this good news of the kingdom of salvation has already resulted in the saving of a great crowd of good-will persons out of all nations, even as it was foretold. (Rev. 7:9-17, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font0"> At Armageddon God’s kingdom will triumph and will free the universe of Satan’s organization and save this great crowd of good will through Armageddon’s tribulation and into the new world, the righteous new system of things. Then that kingdom will bring salvation to even the dead in the memorial tombs by resurrecting them to life on earth during the thousand years of Christ’s reign. All these things being taken into consideration, here indeed, since 1919, is a salvation by him the good news about which deserves to be told from day to day.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts 17: 2, 3, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To be efficient, productive ministers in door-to-door preaching we need a clear presentation. The three- to eightminute Bible sermon stresses an appropriate theme by means of a few selected texts. Carefully reading aloud from the Bible each of these texts enables the person visited to see that a true minister of God’s good news is backing up what he says with God’s Word. Sometimes we may feel that nothing we say will gain attention in a particular community because of religious prejudice. In part this may be true, but should we give up, saying, ‘Nothing works here’? No. Should we patiently, tactfully keep on presenting a lively, interesting three- to eight-minute sermon? Yes. Reading aloud scriptures in support of your description of the established Kingdom stirs in the listener a deeper respect for the Bible. Thus gently we help the listener to replace false ideas with accurate knowledge and see in us a true friend.

<p><span class="font0">Do you know how you ought to answer, to offer spiritual sacrifices, with graciousness, seasoned with salt? Just as it was in the days of Christ and the apostles and early disciples, so today it is at the doors and in the homes of the people that these verbal sacrifices are most frequently and most effectively offered. Do you give advance thought and preparation to your doorstep sermons, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one you meet at the door? On this initial visit it is especially important to find words that are plain, simple and pleasing, not controversial. If some controversy arises, however, remember that a slave of the Lord does not need to fight. So while you give a reason for the hope in you, do so “together with a mild temper and deep respect.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">10/15</span><span class="font0"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In our service the bach-calling link is basic. And a strong link it is too. But just how strong it is depends on how faithfully we call back after initial literature placements. To provide himself with opportunities for back-calls, the productive minister spends many hours each month in introductory house-to-house service, using his short sermons. Many zealous witnesses readily place literature but experience little success in following it up. Can it be that they find it hard to get to the subject of the truth? Sometimes this is so. But why be timid about it? They know you are a minister; you said so on your initial call at their home. They saw you use your Bible and they expect it again. Yes, you do need proper tools to start work, so create the situation by going prepared to talk further on the subject you dealt with in your first short sermon.

<p><span class="font0">9; 37, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Carrying out the command to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth is a big work. There are many people that must be reached and instructed in God’s Word. People by the tens of thousands are responding to this good news, but more fulltime workers are needed to care for the Master’s harvest. How can persons in isolated areas or in distant lands be reached unless God’s organization has dedicated persons who are willing to devote their full time to the Kingdom ministry? Once Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia beseeching, “Step over into Macedonia and help us.” (Acts 16: 9, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font0">W) Since Paul was serving Jehovah full time he was free to go there and direct persons of good will in the way of life. He gave no thought to himself or to his own interests. He had Jehovah’s interests at heart and was willing to go wherever he was directed. This is the mental attitude each full-time servant of Jehovah should have today. W </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span><span class="font0"> 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 6:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fight against the wicked spirit forces is not yet over for us. Satan is trying to hold his position as a cosmocrat, he and his demons being cosmo-crats, “world rulers.” Particularly since the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C. and the overthrow of God’s typical theocracy have these exercised a wicked cosmoeracy. Now they are opposed to us because we preach another cosmoeracy, God's rulership of the new world by Christ. We need to watch, light and pray as never before. Suddenly, however, final triumph will be ours, when Jehovah’s day comes as a thief in the night and this world is abandoned to its destruction at Armageddon, when all spiritism and the wicked spirit forces are put out of action and we of the New World society are taken along with the triumphant King Jesus Christ into the demon-free new world under God’s universal sovereignty. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 43, 46</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 96:11-13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All earthly creation will benefit from Jehovah’s coming to rule and judge. For all those ruining the earth will themselves be ruined at Armageddon and once again, as in the garden of Eden, all nature will have full sweep to express itself to the glory and praise of its splendorous Creator. What wonder, then, that even all unintelligent things in earth and heaven should be addressed and called upon to applaud, to roar, to thunder, to look their most beauteous I All such things have reason to be glad and rejoice in that their own Creator has become King and has come to his temple for liberating judgment work. But how about us </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'i</span><span class="font0"> How much more should we speech-endowed, Bible-reading, intelligent living creatures sing to him, say that he has become King and tell the good news of his salvation I </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 21, 22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Not only does productive witnessing mean much preaching activity, but it must be done with an eye for quality as well. There was a time when we gave little thought and planning to our service. But those days are gone. We must be diligent, using precious time effectively. A production line yields results only when work is being done, and that skillfully. So it must also be within the New World society. Service must never lag. It must be well planned, well organized, become effective and be kept moving on the part of all of us. In early Christian times Jehovah’s witnesses were productive. Now in the last days productive witnessing has been revived. It has borne fruit so that in 1956 a peak of 640,347 reported service. Obligation is urgent upon those mature to aid beginners to become skillful in their work, to grow to maturity, that their witnessing likewise may become productive and so that they may also stand approved before the King Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 21, 22a</span></p>

Thereby may we gain his approval by increasing our privileges, and finally hear: “Well done, good and faithful slave !” Until that happy time let each one prove to be a faithful steward, offering the sacrifices of joy and singing praises unto Jehovah. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 19-21a</span></p>

God will be angry if you beg off because you value material things more than the spiritual. Luxuries of the present, such as the latest model automobile, you do not need in order faithfully to care for New World interests. Many so-called good things of this old world can become snares to us in our New World society. Instead, by taking our God-given commission to heart and storing up heavenly treasure by helping others into the New World society we shall be practicing the Scriptural advice to keep our balance in all things and thoroughly accomplish our ministry.

The demons are now “spirits in prison,” restrained from directly materializing. But they do not have to materialize to accomplish their purpose. Already, more than forty years since the Kingdom’s establishment, the wicked spirit forces have shown their ability to exercise their cosmo-cratic power, without materializations, to spread spiritualism, to corrupt mankind, to cause the earth to be filled with violence and to lead the worldly rulers of all kinds of political systems to a showdown fight against the Almighty God and his Christ at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font0">As productive ministers go from house to house they place certain literature. It may be booklets, magazines, a book or a Bible—assuredly something. Each worker’s number of placements will depend on his diligence and the amount of time he works. Who can say the three- to eight-minute sermon has not increased his literature placements? But after placing one or more helpful publications docs the diligent worker let the implanted seed of truth sprout of itself? Does he allow Satan the opportunity to destroy it? No. As the Society has recently reminded all field workers, according to Scriptural counsel we must not deprive the stranger of his right to learn the truth. Indeed, it is imperative that willing listeners be promptly revisited, for watering the implanted seed and to protect the tender young growth. The productive minister expects fruitage.

Victory over Satan would be impossible without prayer. We should pray for God's name to be sanctified, for his kingdom to come, and for his will to come to pass on earth as in heaven. Those things for prayer were put first by Jesus. To what earthly ruler could we find immediate access with matters that to him may appear trifling?

He must work with the local congregation by helping those who need assistance in the Kingdom ministry. Some pioneers are given the added privilege of serving as overseers. They must also take the lead in showing love and understanding. Besides keeping up their personal study, which is essential, they must take care of their personal needs, which may include a part-time job. To keep up such a schedule a pioneer must have organization of personal affairs, planning each day in advance. So full-time service as a pioneer is not easy.

Remember, Jehovah’s blessing and prosperity will continue upon all those who obey his will and serve his purpose and faithfully deliver this divine message, for surely, as Jehovah has purposed, so shall it stand. —Isa. 14:24. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 17, 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.—1 Pet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remember that we represent Jehovah and have his backing. You are convinced that you are speaking the truth? Then let that conviction show in your delivery. You are sincere? Let it shine through. You are enthusiastic about the truth? Make that manifest to them by your tone of voice and expression of face. Certainly you go to them as a friend ; so be warm and friendly. Draw them into the conversation by asking questions. Approach each door with the thought that the one behind it is a sheep, a friend, and let your interest and concern for him show. Do not let the goat at the last door give you a negative attitude for the next door. Each door deserves our best and should not get less just because it may be in the midst of hard territory. At all times show mildness of temper and deep respect. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15 </span><span class="font0">4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">But let him prove what his own work is, and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone, and not in comparison with the other person.—Gal. 6: J/, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In view of the productiveness of the New World society, let us ask ourselves a few questions : What is our position in God’s communicating organization? What evidence do we have to show that we are productive witnesses? Do we work or just ride along? Do we set right examples in personal study, in faithful meeting attendance? Are we regular in the service from house to house, on back-calls, in the use of Bible sermons, in conducting Bible studies and helping others by supporting the training program? Do we share in and support all witnessing campaigns? Good production means doing all these things. As Jehovah is productive, so must we be as we work together in his New World society of Kingdom-fruit bearers. This must be so if we desire life in his New World. Jehovah’s most wonderful blessings are in store for those who are productive witnesses. Are you one? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 23a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">You must not swear without performing, but you must pay your vows to Jehovah.—Matt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">5: 33, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nation of Israel (excepting a faithful remnant) was a large-scale example of proving false to the oath of Jehovah, entering into a covenant with him by oath and rebelliously failing to carry out that covenant. The nation of Israel, Shimei and Zedekiah are examples of warning to us not to treat lightly our own oath of Jehovah in dedicating ourselves to him through Christ and then not carrying out that dedication faithfully in full obedience to his will. His command to us is: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.” His King Jesus Christ reigns since A.D. 1914 and the King’s command to us is: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” In Jehovah’s name we are sworn to obey these commands. The word of the inspired wise man is: “Keep the king’s commandment, and [that] on account of the oath of God.” (Eccl. 8: 2, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font0"> This we will determinedly do.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tell of his salvation from day to day.—Ps. 96: 2, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God’s kingdom being the only rightful government of heaven and earth, the only one that will vindicate his universal sovereignty and save mankind, salvation by it is worth telling out to others who also need salvation. Owing to the coming destruction of this wicked system of things, salvation by God’s means is something most timely to be told daily. It is the only good news today. If we rejoice daily in the Kingdom, if we feel like shouting Hallelujah! at the realization that it is ruling now in the midst of its enemies, we shall bubble over into talking of the salvation it brings. The telling of salvation by Jehovah is, in fact, a part of our worship of him, and we know we must render him worship every day. Tell it, then, from day to day. If we do not sing to Jehovah by telling it, we do not have the joy of Jehovah. Sharing in his joy is a stronghold to us. And this good news of salvation we must not only tell individually but also collectively in one grand unity. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 14, 15a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stay awake, stand firm in the jaith, carry on as men, grow mighty.—1 Cor. 16:13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remember, when we enter the full-time service we are bound to have many trials. This was true of the faithful men of ancient times and so we should expect it to be with us. Among such trials is, of course, persecution. It, however, is only one of the trials we must contend with. Discouragement, for example, is a trial that pioneers and missionaries must contend with continually. Working day after day with little or no results is very discouraging, and the natural tendency is to say: “What’s the use?” That is exactly what Satan wants us to conclude. He does not want us to serve Jehovah either full time or part time. He wants us to quit. But consider Jeremiah. God told him before he even began preaching that the people would not listen to him. Did Jeremiah say, “What’s the use?” No, he knew he was doing God’s will and by continuing in his assignment in spite of this indifference he proved his integrity. Let us likewise stand firm. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font0">18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Keep your balance in all things, ... do missionary work, thoroughly accomplish your ministry.—2 Tim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">4: 5, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Objections based on prejudice may hinder us from presenting the truth to the people in our territory. What can be done? To accomplish our ministry thoroughly we shall want to cultivate the ability to overcome those objections. But when? Perhaps we arrive a little early at the Kingdom Hall. Why not use the time wisely? Exchange suggestions. Practice them on one another. Discuss how to refute the objection without raising antagonism, but rather stirring up curiosity or interest in our work. Perhaps an apt illustration will help to put across the point while side-stepping prejudice. Work up new sermons for house-to-house and back-call work in the same way. Analyze the texts you wish to use. Such discussions as part of your personal study program require very little extra time and will not be at all like work, but rather enjoyable, stimulating, and at the same time they will equip you to be a more able minister.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Look! we pronounce happy those who have endured.—Jas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">5:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you serve Jehovah out of love you will not hold back from giving him full-time service, if it is at all possible for you to do so. And having decided that this treasure is for you then make up your mind that you are going to hang on to it with all your strength. Never let it go. Do not quit the full-time service when persecution comes upon you. Do not quit when your spirit becomes low because of discouragement. Do not quit when lured by financial gain. Do not quit because of weariness from long years of service. Instead of quitting, hold on to that treasure of full-time service. Never allow your eyes to become dull to its resplendent beauty. Never lose your appreciation of it. Rejoice over it as the angels, the patriarchs, the prophets, Jesus Christ and the apostles rejoiced over it and cherished it. Never forget that its rewards are eternal, its blessings beyond compare. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 22, 23a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord gives the command; great is the host of those who bore the tidings.—Ps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In the months ahead, as we confidently expect, all Kingdom announcers will become magazine publishers. A sturdy congregation organization is essential for attaining this goal. Definite times should be set for magazine distribution on the street, from store to store and house to house. Service centers are especially adapted for this, and here too the training program will help much, even as in the regular house-to-house witnessing. Have you not as yet shared in witnessing with magazines? There is no time like the present to start. With another you can start, finding how effectively you can serve. Thus unitedly we can attain the goal: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Every productive minister a magazine publisher.</span><span class="font0"> This naturally will mean expanding magazine production by your fellow workers at Brooklyn and other branches. But this added work to those already busy ones will bring increasing joy, for in it they will see a fulfillment of the above words of the psalmist.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oh come, let us sing unto Jehovah; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.—Ps. 95:1, 3, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How can we stay mute, when the divine command is to sing, sing to Jehovah I If there was singing at God’s laying of the foundation of the earth and at the birth of his Son—yes, if anyone now has a song, if anyone ever had a song, we witnesses of Jehovah today have a song! Yes, we have a song, a new song, the like of which never before floated melodiously throughout the inhabited earth. Our song has the latest, newest theme. Our rhapsody of Bible melody has become the song hit among increasing thousands of people of good will regardless of their nationality and language. Its composer is the happy God Jehovah, who inspired it by his holy spirit. His Song Director for us is his royal Son Jesus Christ. Do not withhold your voice, then. Sing, sing for joy, in entrancing harmony with all the New World society. Unitedly, unceasingly, tell out the good news of salvation by Jehovah from day to day.
