<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Building a Happy Family Life</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">M</span><span class="font0">AN has accomplished many amazing exploits. He has even traveled to the moon. But on earth he has been a failure in solving fundamental problems. For example, man has been unsuccessful, for the most part, in building happy, united families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There has been a worldwide deterioration in family life. The situation has become so bad that some observers predict the dissolution of the family. The Toronto </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font0"> of November 24, 1967, carried the headline “IS FAMILY DOOMED IN YEAR 2000?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The article said: “Anthropologist Margaret Mead calls the contemporary family structure a 'massive failure’... Miss Mead sees as doomed the present life style that emphasizes marriage as the principal relationship between men and women.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why has family life deteriorated so terribly in recent times?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The answer is clear. The sound counsel in God’s Word the Bible has been neglected, or even ignored. What a terrible mistake this has been! For the Bible shows us how to cope successfully with the problems of everyday life. Actually there is no place where we could find better advice, because Jehovah, the Author of the Bible, is also the One who originated marriage and arranged for family life.—Gen. 2:18, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When God brought the first man and woman together as husband and wife, he purposed that the marriage should be permanent. He also emphasized the unity that should exist between the human pair. Jesus drew attention to this when he said: “Did you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’? So that they are no longer two, but one flesh.”—Matt. 19:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Note that marriage mates were not to be competitors. Nor were they simply to be acquaintances that shared the same dwelling place. No, they were to be “one flesh.” So, marriage mates are to cultivate deep love for each other, and seek to be drawn together in unity of purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But can this really be accomplished? Is it reasonable to expect family members to live together in peace and unity at all times? What counsel in the Bible can draw husbands and wives together in a happy union?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690608_files/g_E_19690608-3.png" alt="" style="width:406pt;height:131pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">F</span><span class="font0">OR married life really to be happy, both husband and wife must appreciate their respective positions. These are not set merely by local custom. Rather, they are outlined in God’s own Word the Bible, and are in harmony with the qualities that God implanted in man and woman at the time of creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Knowing how he made man, and the purpose he had in view, Jehovah recorded in his Word that “a husband is head of his wife as the Christ also is head of the congregation.” (Eph. 5:23) This means that the husband is to take the lead in the home, planning family activities and shouldering the responsibility for making final decisions. But this does not authorize him to be a harsh or cruel ruler of his household.—Col. 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though many men have exercised headship in an unloving way, Christian husbands should avoid this. They should study carefully how Jesus Christ has exercised headship over the Christian congregation, and then follow his fine example. At Ephesians 5:25 husbands are counseled: “Continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it.” So doing, they will not be overly demanding of their wives, but will handle family affairs in a way that refreshes everyone concerned.—Matt. 11: 28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wife, for her part, “should have deep respect for her husband.” (Eph. 5: 33) Since he is the one authorized by God to take the lead, she can make a great contribution to family happiness by willingly submitting to his headship. (Col. 3: 18) If she is keener of mind than her husband, as is sometimes the case, then she can use this quality to support him in his role as head, rather than competing with him or belittling what he does.—Prov. 12:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is much for the wife to do in connection with family life. The Bible fittingly urges married women “to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sound in mind, chaste, workers at home, good, subjecting themselves to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be spoken of abusively.” (Titus 2:4, 5) The wife and mother who faithfully fulfills these duties will win the lasting love and respect of her family.—Prov. 31: 10, 11, 26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many homes problems arise when a husband fails to take into consideration the womanly temperament, the emotional makeup, of his wife. He needs to appreciate that she views things differently. Her emotions respond in a different way. Her strength is not the same as his. Thus the inspired advice to husbands is: “Continue dwelling ... with them according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since you are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life.” (1 Pet. 3:7) When a husband does this, he helps to bring about a spirit of understanding and security in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is common among worldly people for the security of the home to be undermined by sex interests outside the marriage bond. But those who live in harmony with God’s Word are protected against the heartache and grief that such conduct brings. In language that is easy to understand the Bible warns: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.”—Heb. 13:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the Bible makes no allowance for immoral conduct. Those who want to be servants of God must lead clean lives. (1 Thess. 4:3-8) They must limit their sex interests to their own legal marriage mates, and they are accountable before God to do so. (Prov. 5:15-21) It ought to be the earnest desire of both husband and wife to help each other to avoid any temptation to wrongdoing. They can do this by showing unselfish consideration for each other in this intimate aspect of their lives.—1 Cor. 7:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, if a marriage union is truly going to function in harmony with the godly principles that we have discussed, there must also be regular emphasis on spiritual matters. The worship of Jehovah God should be of first importance in the home. It should not be shoved aside in favor of efforts to obtain more material possessions or to have more time for the pursuit of pleasure. (Luke 8:11, 14, 15) Family prayer and regular sessions of family Bible study should be part of every family’s way of life. Do you arrange for this in your home?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, much of the trouble in families today centers around the rearing of children. Is it possible to avoid this trouble?</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">HEN children are born, it is the earnest desire of loving parents to see that the lives of those young ones turn out well. But the task is not an easy one. There are many problems that arise along the way. These can be met successfully only by applying the counsel in God’s Word.—Prov. 22:6; Deut. 11:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much time and effort are usually required to see that there are proper food, dean clothing and a pleasant home in which to live. But the Bible repeatedly shows that the responsibility of parents by no means ends there. It is also vital to include the children regularly in the family’s struction in the Word of God.—Ps. 78:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Parents should talk to their children about Jehovah and his ways, not only during regular study sessions, but at other times too. As God’s law to Israel stated: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up,” (Deut. 6:6, 7) When this is done, children learn to think of God in relationship to all the activities of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is principally on the father, as head of the household, that the Scriptures lay the responsibility to see that this instruction is given. When he makes provision for it and personally takes the lead in giving it, the entire family is drawn more closely together. At the same time, the children are given the kind of training that they so greatly need. So it is important to take to heart what is recorded at Ephesians 6:4: “You, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bring. ing them up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.”—See also Proverbs 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Part of the “discipline ... of Jehovah” that must be taught involves the child’s obligation to be obedient to its parents. This is not something to be treated lightly, because the child’s prospects for eternal life are involved. God’s Word says: “Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous.” —Eph. 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God is the One who requires that children obey their parents. Therefore, parents are wise if they patiently and consistently impress this lesson on the mi:d and heart of their offspring.—Col. 3:20, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There will be times when this calls for more than just telling the child what is right. When he deliberately does what he knows to be wrong, stronger action is required to impress the seriousness of the matter on him. Wisely the Bible observes: “Foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy; the rod of discipline is what will remove it far from him.” (Prov. 22:15) Due to inherited imperfection children are born with a tendency to do what is bad, so they need correction. A loving parent will not neglect this. As Proverbs 13:24 says: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Discipline that is administered in love has the lasting good of the child in view. It is not done in violent bursts of anger or with loud screaming of threats. That is not the Christian way. (Eph. 4:31, 32) There must be firmness, but soundness of mind should also prevail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The parents themselves should be setting a good example, not just to put on an appearance of righteousness—children quickly see through that—but honestly, sincerely. And if they do so, the children will be helped to realize that God's righteous principles rule the household, and not just unreasonable whims or temporary moods. The young ones will not fear that they will be the victims of unjust punishment. Rather, they will associate punishment with the breaking of proper rules of good conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the righteous principles from the Bible that deserve serious family discussion are those having to do with godly moral standards. Children need to be taught, for example, that “everyone liking and carrying on a lie” is detestable to Jehovah. (Rev. 22:15; Prov. 6:16-19) Theft, too, in all its various forms, should be seen as a violation of God’s moral standard. (Eph. 4:28; Rom. 13:9, 10) These young folks need to be warned, in a way that they will understand, against sexual immorality and anything that may lead to it. —Eph. 5:5; Prov. 5:3-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Discuss together as a family the various problems that arise at home, at school and in play. Reason together on the scriptures that show the kind of conduct that is pleasing to God. In this way the children will learn to apply the Bible in their own lives. It will be a safeguard, so that even when children are away from their parents the admonition they have received will continue to guide them.—Prov. 6:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Careful thought also needs to be given to choice of companions. Associates deeply influence one’s life. Wholesome companions have a good effect, but “bad associations spoil useful habits.” (1 Cor. 15: 33) Time and again the Bible record illustrates this fact.—Gen. 34:1, 2; Num. 25: 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Children may not appreciate the seriousness of bad associations, but parents should. So it is an evidence of wisdom on their part to keep a loving eye on their children’s choice of companions. These companions include, not only those with whom the children play, but also those about whom they read and those that they watch in motion pictures and on television. —Phil. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For family life to be truly satisfying, however, more is needed than avoiding what is harmful. There should also be the enjoyment of doing wholesome things together as a family. The real joy of family life is lost when each one goes his own way without regard for the others. But when there is upbuilding family discussion, when plans are laid together and everyone works together to fulfill them, the family is drawn together in unity. (Prov. 15:22) This is not difficult when there is love in the home. And love is a normal thing among those who truly know God and have his spirit.—1 John 4:7, 8; Gal. 5:22, 23.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690608_files/g_E_19690608-6.png" alt="" style="width:210pt;height:173pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">E</span><span class="font0">VEN in homes that are normally happy, difficulties may arise at times. These are often due to human imperfection, or the pressures of the world in which we live. What should be done when friction develops between family members?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The solution is not too hard to find if we remember that all of us are imperfect. It is not only outside the home but also within the family circle that we need to apply the inspired counsel: “Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindi.iess, lowliness of mind, mildness, and long-suffering. Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also. But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” —Col. 3:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By showing forgiveness a person imitates Jehovah God, to whom the psalmist said: “If errors were what you watch, . . . O Jehovah, who could stand? For there is the true forgiveness with you.” (Ps. 130:3, 4) The Bible also says: “Hatred is what stirs up contentions, but love covers over even all transgressions.&quot; &quot;The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger, and it is beauty on his part to pass over transgression.”—Prov. 10:12; 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a problem appears to be of a particularly serious nature, there are steps that can be taken to prepare the way for loving forgiveness. For example, when a dispute arises between the children, one of the parents might sit down with them, listen to the problem, and then encourage fitting apologies and the needed forgiveness. On these occasions scriptures such as the ones that we have just read could be reviewed with benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the difficulty is between husband and wife, it is certainly best not to air it before the children. Nor will the situation be improved by broadcasting complaints to friends and neighbors. Though one may have been deeply hurt, shouting will not make conditions any better. As the Bible says: &quot;A man given to anger stirs up contention, and anyone disposed to rage has many a transgression.”—Prov. 29:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also, the breach will only widen if husband and wife go for days without talking to each other. The Christian thing to do is to discuss the problem together, with a firm resolve to restore peace. Even if the other person is the wrongdoer, make reconciliation easier by your own kindness. If you are at fault, humbly ask forgiveness. Do not postpone it; handle the problem without delay. “Let the sun not set with you in a provoked state.&quot;—Eph. 4:26; see also Matthew 18:21-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though divorce is common in the world, the Bible does not recommend it as the way to settle problems. Marriage is a lifelong tie, and is not to be regarded lightly. (Rom. 7:2) God’s Word allows only one ground on which a Christian may get a divorce that frees him for remarriage. What is that? It is adultery. In this event, it is up to the innocent one to decide whether to seek a divorce or not. (Matt. 5:32) However, divorce action should never be taken merely on suspicion; there ought to be clear-cut evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the past, before learning God’s righteous requirements, some persons may have been hasty in getting a divorce, and now they have taken up living with another mate. What can they do about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They cannot go back and live their lives over. But, if they want to have a part in the service of Jehovah God, and they are living with a mate, they should make sure that their present marriage is legally registered with the government. They ought to go to God in prayer and seek his forgiveness for their past course. Then they should work hard at living from this time on according to God’s requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What if your marriage mate has declined to study God’s Word with you, and you are not able to discuss problems together on the basis of Bible principles?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bible still encourages you to stay together and not to view separation as the easy way out of your problems. Do what you personally can to improve the situation in your home by applying what the Bible says in regard to your own conduct. In time, because of your Christian conduct, you may win over your mate. —1 Cor. 7:10-16; 1 Pet. 3:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is much that can be done in every home In building toward a happier family life. Apply Bible counsel, and there will be good results! Let each one in the household lovingly seek the welfare of the others, thus strengthening family ties. (Col. 3:14) Above all, share unitedly in true worship, so that all of you together will enjoy the rich blessing of Jehovah God, the One who can crown your happiness with eternal life.—Prov. 3:11-18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">O</span><span class="font0">N December 11, 1968, the pilot of a TWA jet airliner flying from St. Louis to Miami radioed ground controllers: “A guy has a gun in my back. He is forcing us to go to Havana. We are proceeding there.” For the past year this has become an increasingly familiar announcement as acts of air piracy have multiplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During 1968 there were twenty-eight planes that hijackers forced to Cuba; some were small chartered planes, but most were airliners. It appears, however, that 1969 will be an even bigger year for the hijacker. By the middle of February fifteen airplanes had already been hijacked. One was an Ecuadorian plane en route from Quito to Miami and another was a Venezuelan plane. In fact, more than 18 Latin American planes have been hijacked since 1967. But what happens when they get to Cuba?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hijacking has become such a frequent occurrence that pilots on commercial routes to the southeastern part of the United States carry maps of Havana’s Jose Marti-International Airport, and the procedure on the ground has become routine. The Miami Traffic Control Center for the Federal Aviation Agency promptly notifies Havana of the hijacking, and an official of the Swiss embassy in Washington fills out a prepared form asking Cuba for the prompt release of the plane and its</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>AIR</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">passengers. The Swiss embassy does this because it has handled United States diplomatic contacts with Cuba ever since the United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1960.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A person flying to Miami these days cannot be certain that he will not find himself in Havana. It appears that this is the reason why many officials of the United States government choose to go to Florida by train rather than by plane. They are not likely to be embarrassed by suddenly finding themselves in Communist Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Happens to Passengers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the TWA jet landed in Havana at 12:30 p.m. the passengers were removed from the plane, and the hijacker was taken away by the Cuban authorities. There is uncertainty as to what becomes of the hijackers. It is believed that some are imprisoned and others are put to work on state farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Eight hours after the plane landed, the Cubans permitted it to return to the United States with its crew but not the passengers. They did not leave until 10 p.m. on another plane, a propeller plane flown from the United States for that purpose. In many instances passengers have had to wait until the next day. The Cuban authorities contended that the passengers could not return with their planes for reasons of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the passengers had to stay overnight to await a propeller plane to come</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and pick them up, the Cubans put them in a hotel and treated them well. The hotel was usually the Havana Libre, which was formerly the Havana Hilton, Sometimes they were taken to the Varadero International, which is a thirty-five-minute bus ride out of town. It is more convenient to the Varadero Airport, where the propeller planes usually picked up the passengers for return to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides being an inconvenience to the passengers, the Cuban refusal to permit them to return with the jet that brought them has been costly to the airlines. Cuban landing fees for the jet and for the second plane, the cost of chartering the second plane, as well as the cost of meals and hotel rooms for the passengers, has, according to one estimate, amounted to about $8,500 for each hijacked plane. Other estimates have put it at $15,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An understanding was finally reached in February with the Cuban government that has made it possible for the passengers to return with their jet. The Cuban Foreign Ministry stated that the government was prepared to allow the passengers to return with their plane on a case-by-case basis if the pilot and the airline assume full responsibility for the safety of the aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Why Not Resist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the surface it might appear that a simple solution to the problem would be to resist the hijacker. Perhaps an armed guard could be put on the plane, someone might say, or perhaps the crew could be armed. This is what the Israelis seem to have been doing since one of their airliners was hijacked to Algeria in July 1968. In fact, the United States Federal Aviation Administration has authorized American airline crews to carry guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the pilots as well as the airlines think that a trip to Cuba is preferable to a gun battle in midair. Although a bullet puncturing the pressurized fuselage may not necessarily cause an explosive decompression of the cabin, there is danger of a bullet penetrating a vital part of the plane and causing it to crash. Besides that, some of the passengers might be seriously injured from a gunfight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To minimize the danger to passengers and to the aircraft, pilots and stewardesses are instructed by the airlines to obey the hijacker. This is usually done without hesitation. By following this general policy of not resisting piracy in the air the airlines have succeeded in preventing anyone from being injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Keeping the cockpit doors locked is not entirely effective, because the hijacker can threaten a stewardess with a weapon and force her to communicate his demands to the pilot over the plane’s communication system. Searching all the passengers on every flight is not practical either. It would require too much time and be too disturbing to the passengers. It could disrupt good passenger relations and might involve legal problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Efforts are being made to develop a metal detector that could distinguish a gun or knife from other metal objects that people usually carry, such as keys and watches. If such a detector could be manufactured and installed without being too costly, it might reveal an armed passenger as he passes it. But it would not necessarily detect explosives that a person might be carrying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the hope of forestalling hijackings, the Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Association have offered a combined reward of $25,000 for information leading to the conviction of persons attempting to hijack airplanes. The reward, however, is not payable to airline employees, law enforcement officers and passengers on a hijacked plane. This is to prevent possible injury to passengers by reward hunters on the plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Penalties</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On January 21, 1969, a couple from New York city who hijacked an airliner to Cuba were charged with piracy in an arrest warrant issued in Federal Court. On the basis of a law passed in the United States in 1961 this couple would be in real trouble if they returned to the United States, Their minimum punishment would be twenty years in prison and the maximum would be death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is the desire of the International Air Transport Association to have the various national governments of its members to enact legislation that would make the hijacking of civil aircraft subject to the same penalties as piracy. The Swiss government appears to favor this because on February 19, 1969, after an Israeli airliner was shot at in the Geneva airport by Arab terrorists, it urged international acceptance of a proposal to outlaw acts of piracy in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Until now few hijackers have actually been arrested. They appear to be safe from prosecution because Cuba has steadfastly refused to return the hijackers for punishment. If this Cuban policy were changed, the fad of hijacking airliners would most likely stop immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">ItTio </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Are the Hijackers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some of the hijackers have been Cuban exiles who wanted to return to Cuba. They chose this way of getting there because there are no flights between the United States and Cuba, although there are between Mexico and Cuba, as well as a few other countries. About thirty hijackers have been Americans. In some instances they are criminals fleeing from the law. This was the case of the hijacker of a Delta Airlines plane in March 1968 who was being sought by the police for a payroll robbery. In other instances the hijackers appeared to be emotionally upset over the racial issues in the United States.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">As might be expected with something that has been as well publicized as airliner hijackings, there have been a few mentally unbalanced persons who have tried their hand at it. One was caught on a Delta flight when he suddenly dropped his gun and began weeping. Two others were put in psychiatric hospitals after they reached Cuba. Still others appear to have been exhibitionists, such as the twenty-one-year-old “hippie” and his girl friend who attempted to hijack a National Airlines plane on February 3, 1969. He was caught at gunpoint after he had permitted the plane to land for fuel and allowed the passengers to get off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The hijacking of airliners is not likely to stop, despite the severe penalties, as long as there is no danger that the hijackers will be returned for prosecution. At a conference in Montreal, representatives of various nations expressed reluctance to do this because of fear that some hijackers might be prosecuted for political offenses, such as criticizing their governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As is so often the case, lack of international trust makes the solving of the hijacking problem difficult. But whatever is finally done, the fact remains that air piracy has become another indication of the growing breakdown in respect for law, order and the rights of others.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>of the North</span></h4>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!&quot; correspondent in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">W</span><span class="font0">OULD you like to travel on a highway that has no pavement and no cars, yet takes you through some of the most fascinating country on the North American continent? Stretching for more than 1,500 miles through the vast Canadian northland runs the Western Arctic's only highway, the Mackenzie River. Flowing into the Arctic Ocean at a rate of over 3,700,000 gallons per second, this great waterway drains almost onefifth of the total area of Canada or about 700,000 square miles, a region two and a half times the size of Texas or more than thirteen times as large as England. Bearing the name of the man who first explored it, Alexander Mackenzie, this water highway is the last of its kind on this continent. It fulfills a role that all great rivers once played, that of serving as the major supply route between the outside world and its people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, before you accept our offer too readily, let us warn you that the journey will take eight weeks, and you will have to sleep under the invisible stars in the &quot;land of the midnight sun.” You will face the cool Arctic wind and fight hordes of pesky insects coming to life by the millions in the sun’s warm rays. But you will also meet friendly natives living their simple but happy lives in this vast, untamed land. Also, be prepared to feel the</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">bone-chilling wetness from the spray of the 40-degree water as your canoe bucks and rocks through the wind-driven waves often reaching four feet in height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Come along as we retrace a 1,500-mile canoe trip down this majestic highway for the purpose of bringing the message of Kingdom hope to its 9,000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Preparing for the Trip</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first step in preparing for this trip is to find a suitable craft, one that will be light enough to be powered by a small outboard engine, yet stable and capable of carrying a relatively large load. In this case we choose a maneuverable twentyfoot freighter canoe because its flat bottom prevents tipping, yet allows it to carry over one ton of supplies. The flat stern of the canoe makes it easy to attach one of the two outboard motors that we take along, while the flat bottom provides ample space for the small drums carrying our 45 gallons of gasoline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also, into the boat go bedrolls, a tent, other camping equipment, 100 to 150 pounds of food and cooking utensils, medical supplies, a steel anchor with twenty feet of chain, sixty quarts of outboard oil, extra clothing, miscellaneous items and over 2,500 pieces of Bible literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tarpaulins, thrown over this heaped load and tied securely with a 50-foot rope, prevent waves from splashing in during stretches of rough water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The River Valley and Delta</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our journey down this highway begins at Fort Providence, the first outpost along the Mackenzie River Valley. Even though it is early summer and the days are long, we must make haste as a strong east wind is blowing. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">At this</span><span class="font0"> time of year, an east wind could spell trouble, as it forces the breaking ice from the Great Slave Lake into the Mackenzie River. Already the air is filled with the tinkling sound of breaking ice as a steady silver stream of ice floes jams its way into the main current. To get trapped amid these chunks, some ranging up to four feet thick and fifteen to twenty feet across, would mean disaster. To wait until the ice stops flowing could mean a delay of perhaps two weeks. Navigating carefully along the less congested edges of the river, we glide smoothly past countless islands, swamps, and low banks lined with willow trees. Averaging a speed of about ten knots, we soon come to a large river that spills its brown sediment-filled water into the clean, cold Mackenzie. This is the Liard River, which flows through the wild, but beautiful and mysterious Nahanni Valley. When these waters finally merge, the Mackenzie is stained for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">remaining thousand miles </span><span class="font0">of its journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the river valley the little settlements are situated from 50 to 200 miles apart, with no human habitation between. Often it takes several days to travel from one settlement to the next. But there is no monotony, for there is much to do, see and learn about the marvelous wonders of creation. Of never failing interest is the smooth gliding river as it winds past steep, heavily wooded banks. How peaceful it is to listen to the lonely sound of the northern loon as it hunts for its evening meal!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon arriving in one of the villages, we are usually greeted by curious glances from its inhabitants. In a short while the whole population, 90 to 95 percent of which is comprised of native people of the Slavi or other Indian tribes, is aware of our visit, since strangers in this land are uncommon. However, upon talking to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">them about God’s purposes we remain </span><span class="font0">strangers for only a short period of time. Generally leading simple lives, these folk provide for their families by fishing in summer, trapping and hunting in winter. It is not uncommon to find complete families moving from their winter quarters to a favorite stream in the wilderness. Here for a few weeks they can find and smoke a good catch of fish for feeding themselves and their dogs during winter. These humble people listen intently to us, since they desire to enjoy the marvelous blessing of living in peace and happiness in the Paradise earth now so near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The country along the valley offers us a panorama of ever-changing beauty. As we journey along, the low banks between Fort Providence and Fort Simpson give way to the 3,000-foot-high Mackenzie Mountains. A few hundred miles downstream we find the lower Franklin Mountains. Sometimes it is possible to see a re</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">freshing stream cascading down a steep </span><span class="font0">bank providing fresh, clean water for us to drink. How interesting it is to pass by Fort Norman and the area called ‘the Everlasting Fires’ where lignite beds have been burning since the days when Alexander Mackenzie first went down the river in 1789! Beneath the forest wilderness lies an untold wealth in the form of minerals and crude oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The community of Norman Wells, approximately 500 miles down the river, has tapped part of this wealth, as the most northerly oil refinery in the Western Hemisphere is located there. However, the land does not yield its riches easily. In the summer the marshy countryside or muskeg threatens to swallow any heavy machine that moves over it, while hordes of mosquitoes, blackflies and other insects render life almost impossible for man. In winter the whole land becomes enveloped in the icy grip of sub-zero temperatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Below Norman Wells we travel through the most spectacular stretch of the entire waterway, for here are the most dangerous and largest rapids of the Mackenzie, the Sans Sault. Alexander Mackenzie aptly described them as ‘seething with a noise like a kettle.’ Even above the noise of the outboard motor, the hiss of the white water can be distinctly heard. Reaching speeds of 12 to 15 knots, they swirl downward, then roll back on the surface in an awesome display of whitecaps. Small craft are warned to stay in the less violent water left of the mainstream, as the rapids have claimed the lives of several persons, caught in their grip and unable to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After making it through safely, we next come to the Ramparts, where the river narrows down from over one mile in width to approximately one-quarter of a mile and flows smooth and fast through a canyon seven miles long, with high limestone cliffs on either side. A short distance from here we truly enter the “land of the midnight sun,” because, on passing above the Arctic Circle, we are neither to experience darkness nor see the sun dip below the horizon for the next five weeks. Several more days of travel bring us to Point Separation, where the river widens out and separates into the Delta area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Mackenzie Delta is one of the most enormous in the Western Hemisphere, a region of half-submerged islands, numerous channels, and low banks slimy in summer from several hundred feet of permafrost. Here we enter the domain of muskrats, ducks and geese, swans, an occasional eagle and the ever-present mosquito. Bound on the west by the Richardson Mountains and the east by the low Caribou Hills, the Delta spreads for seventy miles, while north and south it extends for 100 miles. Two of the largest towns along the river highway lie within this area, Aklavik and Inuvik. From here we come to Reindeer Depot and the last lap of our journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Land of the Pingos</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As we come near the end of the water highway, we notice one of the most extraordinary phenomena of the Western Arctic, the pingo. It may be described as an ice volcano. The mound varies in size from a height of twenty to 200 feet and may have a diameter of 100 feet to almost a quarter of a mile. This ice formation is caused by an upheaval in the permafrost or frozen earth below. The solid blue ice has an outer covering about two feet thick, consisting of earth, grass and flowers. It is delightful to look at the flowers growing on these pingos, especially the purple one, called the saxifrage, which takes only one month to commence growth, flower and mature seed. As we walk away, the ground in this Arctic tundra region is swampy and broken up, reminding us of a soft green carpet. Because of the permafrost, we find no bush or trees in this area. We see many lakes since it is impossible for the melted snow and surface water to seep away through the frozen subsoil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From here we travel a few more miles to a whaling station near the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Notice the great deal of activity in this Eskimo camp in preparation for the whaling season that lasts for about six weeks during July and August. The Eskimo father takes his whole family with him and sets up a temporary tent home in a quiet bay. Upon our arrival, we are greeted very warmly and invited to have a cup of coffee. One of the men is willing to explain to us just how the white or beluga whale is hunted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the whales cannot sound, or dive, in the shallow water, they must stay close to the surface. When they are spotted, the Eskimo follows them in his powered speedboat, and when close enough, he shoots to wound the beluga, thus slowing him down. This gives the hunter just enough time to harpoon his prize and then throw an attached rope and float into the water. After the fatal shot he will be ready to bring the whale into camp. All the blubber is cut off, laid on the shore to sun-dry, and later is cut up into small pieces and boiled to extract the oil. The meat is sliced off and hung over racks to dry. A friendly atmosphere is noticed as different families work together to obtain their winter food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After thanking the Eskimos for their hospitality, we prepare to leave for an eighteen-mile trip across the open water of the Beaufort Sea to Tuktoyaktuk on the Arctic coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Natives and Their Way of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon docking the canoe, we are once again greeted by warm smiles from the Eskimos. We notice they are busy bringing in the morning’s catch of fish that must be cleaned and prepared for the coming winter. The tool that the Eskimo woman is using is called an “ulu,” a razorsharp semicircular knife. From the men we learn that they spend much of their time in fishing, trapping and hunting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We find that the settlement here, like most northern ones, consists of small, simple, wooden houses, a Hudson’s Bay store, a small school and a few government buildings. But where are the igloos, you ask? The Eskimo igloo, which at one time was the family accommodation, is now very seldom used, perhaps on hunting trips only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Everywhere along this water highway progress is evident, but along with progress come problems. Lack of moderation in drinking habits is causing many to come to poverty. Better educational facilities seem to be solving some problems, but not all. To many of the natives the future is not very encouraging. Their knowledge of the Bible and its principles is very limited, even though religious institutions have been present for a long time. How happy many of them are to hear and learn of the wonderful conditions that will shortly come on the earth. They are eager to accept Bibles and Bible literature to increase their understanding of God and his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This brings us to the end of the great river highway. Our canoe, with our food, oil, fuel supplies and all our Bible literature gone, is much lighter now. As once again we admire the golden “midnight sun,” we are very happy that we were able to help the people of this water highway of the north to learn about their Grand Creator and his wonderful purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">I</span><span class="font0">N 1961 a twentyyear-old girl living in Ballston Spa, New York, decided she would have to go to a doctor to see why she was having attacks of palpitation of the heart, shortness of breath, tenderness on the left side of the ab</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">noodles or foods with sugar in them such as candy, pastries, ice cream, and so forth, you are eating carbohydrates. During the course of digestion they are converted to glucose, which is a form of sugar. The glucose passes from</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">domen, severe headaches, great fatigue, depression and a ravenous hunger. Doctor after doctor could find nothing organically wrong that would explain these disturbing symptoms. Finally a doctor decided to test her blood sugar. When he did he found the reason for her troubles— hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is an ailment with which many doctors are not very familiar because information about it is rather sparse as compared with other ailments. As might be expected, there are differences of opinion among medical men as to how widespread the ailment actually is. Some prefer to consider it as a rare malady, whereas others contend that it is much more common than is generally recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The symptoms are not unusual and can be indications of a number of ailments. This may be one reason why some doctors overlook low blood sugar as a possible cause of trouble. But when it is the cause, proper treatment can bring a marked improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">What Is Blood Sugar?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When you eat starchy foods such as bread, potatoes, spaghetti, macaroni and the small intestine into the bloodstream and is carried to the liver, where most of it is converted to a complicated chemical substance called glycogen. This insoluble substance is stored there until needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Glucose is the energy fuel needed by body cells. If the amount of it in the blood is insufficient, the cells will be starved and not operate properly. The brain and nervous system in particular are adversely affected. In the event that a drop in the level of glucose, or blood sugar, is severe, a person may go into a stupor and experience convulsions. If the condition continues, irrevocable damage can be done to the brain, and the person will finally die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other hand, if the level of blood sugar exceeds its proper level, the person will suffer from diabetes. A severe rise in blood sugar can cause him to go into a coma that can lead to death. The level of glucose, or blood sugar, must be just right, neither too low nor too high. Your marvelous body has regulating mechanisms that maintain just the right level, about five grams of blood sugar in the entire blood supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, what does your body do for blood sugar when it may have to wait hours or days for the next meal? To carry you over, the liver will draw upon its stores of glycogen and convert enough to glucose so as to maintain the proper level in the circulatory system. Glycogen is also stored in the muscles and the kidneys and can be used when needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Need for Insulin</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For blood sugar to be maintained at the proper level, insulin is needed. When the concentration of blood sugar is high, insulin causes some of the glucose to be absorbed by the liver and changed to glycogen. When the concentration is low, insulin is withheld, causing the liver and the other cells to reduce their absorption of glucose. If there is too much insulin, however, the level of blood sugar will drop too low. On the other hand, if there is an insufficient supply the level becomes too high and the body suffers from diabetes. Thus insulin is the most important regulator of the mechanism for maintaining the proper balance of blood sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Insulin comes from the pancreas, which is an organ that is about six to eight inches long and resembles a bunch of grapes. Within the pancreas are isolated cells called the islands of Langerhans. These cells secrete insulin, which is carried by the blood to the liver, where it causes the liver to remove enough blood sugar so the level is just right. Some of it circulates throughout the body, enabling each cell to utilize the blood sugar. To help maintain the delicate balance, there is another hormone known as glucagon that opposes the effect of insulin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A need for more blood sugar triggers the adrenal glands to pour hormones into the bloodstream. They cause the liver to change some of the stored glycogen back to glucose, or blood sugar. There is also a reduction in the secretion of insulin. In this manner the proper level of blood sugar is maintained at all times, even during periods of fasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Causes of Low Blood Sugar</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Oversensitivity of the insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas is thought to be a cause of low blood sugar. It is thought that they overreact to a sudden rise in blood sugar. In such cases they apparently secrete too much insulin, and this makes the liver remove too much blood sugar from the bloodstream. The level of circulating blood sugar then drops below the normal level, causing headaches, extreme fatigue and other unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. This sensitivity usually causes a feeling of tenderness on the left side of the abdomen where most of these cells are located near the tail of the pancreas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A method of detecting this ailment is the glucose tolerance test. After a period of fasting, such as overnight, a small amount of blood is taken from the patient’s arm and analyzed for the amount of blood sugar in it. Then he is given a solution of glucose to drink, and other blood samples are taken at hourly intervals. The test ought to last for five or six hours because mild forms of hypoglycemia may not show a drop until then. He must not eat any food until the test is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Normally blood sugar will rise after taking the drink of glucose solution, and then the level will fall back to normal. This indicates that the blood sugar control mechanisms in the body are operating properly. But when they are not, the level of blood sugar, as in the case of hypoglycemia, will drop below the normal level instead of leveling off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another test that is often used is the tolbutamide tolerance test. It is especially effective if a tumor of the insulinproducing cells is involved. Such tumors in the case of organic hypoglycemia appear to be the principal reason for too much insulin being produced by the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other organic causes of this ailment can be tumors in other parts of the body, a diseased liver and diseased adrenal and pituitary glands. Even an inflamed pancreas can cause a drop in blood sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emotional Stress</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What might be termed functional hypoglycemia cannot be traced to any specific physical cause, such as tumors and diseased organs. Emotional stress appears to be one of the reasons for this more common form of low blood sugar. This seems reasonable in view of the delicate balance that must be maintained in the level of blood sugar. If any of the various organs that have to do with maintaining that level are upset by emotional stress the level of blood sugar could be affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On this point Dr. Charles Weller, in his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How to Live with Hypoglycemia, </span><span class="font0">states: “Because it can be triggered by emotional stress (as can some milder forms of diabetes and, many physicians believe, certain heart and blood disorders), it may be a significant key to the as-yet-unknown role of the emotions in physical health.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a very close relationship between blood sugar and the nervous system. According to the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pharmacology in Medicine,</span><span class="font0"> edited by Victor Drill, the “central nervous system is exceedingly dependent upon a proper concentration of glucose in the blood for proper oxygen utilization and reacts quickly to depressions of the blood glucose below 70 to 80 mg per cent. . . . Prolonged, unrelieved hypoglycemia may even lead to irreversible damage to the nervous system, followed by death in hypoglycemic coma.” It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that emotional stress could trigger a cycle of problems by upsetting the level of blood sugar, which in turn affects the nervous system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">How to Live 365 Days a Year,</span><span class="font0"> Dr. John Schindler observes: “The unpleasant emotions can stimulate any or all of the many hormones. What is more, a very acute emotion will produce immediate, profound effects to a much greater degree than will any other type of stressor.” Since adrenaline and insulin are hormones, emotional stress may stimulate the secretion of them to an extent that they upset the blood sugar balance in the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brain Affected</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As with the nervous system, the brain is especially sensitive to fluctuations in blood sugar. If, for example, a baby fails to manufacture the enzyme needed for converting galactose, which results from digesting milk, into glucose, the supply of blood sugar reaching the brain will be insufficient. The result will be brain damage and mental retardation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the brain, of all the tissues in the body, is the most dependent on blood sugar, it is reasonable to expect the brain to manifest symptoms when blood sugar is low. One of these is severe headaches. In an examination of thirty-five persons suffering from migraine headaches, it was found that during the periods when they had severe headaches their blood sugar was low. The lower it dropped the more severe the headaches became. When they adjusted their diet so as to keep their blood sugar level more normal they ceased to have difficulty with headaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mental problems such as depression, anxiety and irrational behavior can also be caused by low blood sugar. In the medical publication </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diseases of the Nervous System,</span><span class="font0"> issue of July 1967, a case is related of a man who manifested the symptoms of schizophrenia and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. But when a reevaluation of his case was later made, hypoglycemia was revealed. It was found that he had a tumor mass on his pancreas that was pouring too much insulin into his blood and caused him to have low blood sugar, which affected his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of the Iowa Medical Society</span><span class="font0"> of June 1968, hypoglycemia was identified as the cause of “behavioral abnormalities such as stupor, tremor, clumsiness, confusion and irrational behavior” in the several cases that the article considered. The observation was then made: “The physician should suspect hyperinsu-linism in all patients with unexplained, intermittent neurologic symptoms, especially when attacks increase in frequency and tend to occur during a period of fasting.&quot; Hyperinsulinism means too much insulin is being produced. This results in hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another publication that links low blood sugar with mental disturbance is the book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Body, Mind and Sugar</span><span class="font0"> by Dr. E. M. Abrahamson. It states: “It has been recognized that manifest hyperinsulinism can be accompanied by many psychic phenomena —depressive states, anxiety, and other symptoms that have been lumped together as ‘neuroses.’ ” This does not mean that all mental problems are due to low blood sugar but rather that it is sometimes a factor that should not be overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatment</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are drugs that can be used for treating hypoglycemia, but they have undesirable side effects. A commonly used one is diazoxide. It appears to elevate the blood sugar level by arresting insulin production. While it can reduce the frequency of hypoglycemic attacks, it seldom eliminates them. This observation was made in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of the Iowa Medical Society</span><span class="font0"> of June 1968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the problem is not caused by a tumor, which can be remedied by surgery, a change in diet has often proved effective. The objective in such a change is to cause the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas to cease being overly sensitive. Until that is accomplished the person with low blood sugar must be careful of what he eats, and he must eat small amounts at frequent intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Frequent small meals prevent wide swings in the level of blood sugar. Instead of the level surging upward after a meal and then plunging downward to a point below normal, it will tend to swing more moderately. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The diet usually is high in proteins and low in carbohydrates. Sugared foods are in most instances completely eliminated so as to prevent sudden rises in blood sugar that may trigger the release of too much insulin in a person suffering from low blood sugar. That includes pastries, ice cream, puddings, grapes, raisins, honey, dates, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because coffee contains caffeine, which stimulates the adrenal cortex, it is forbidden. As you will recall, the adrenal glands produce hormones that cause the liver to raise the level of blood sugar by converting glycogen to blood sugar. Such a sudden rise in blood sugar is too stimulating to overly sensitive insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although a cup of coffee may give a person a momentary lift and may temporarily ease a headache by raising the level of blood sugar, it keeps up the cycle of undesirable swings in the blood sugar. So all coffee and strong tea is usually stopped in order to get the delicate balance of blood sugar back to normal. Soft drinks that contain caffeine, such as cola beverages, are also forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alcoholic drinks such as cocktails, wines, cordials and beer are also usually discontinued while a person is on the diet because alcohol can cause a drop in blood sugar. This is especially so when a person has gone without food for several hours or days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the magazine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aerospace Medicine</span><span class="font0"> of September 1966 the role alcohol plays in lowering blood sugar was pointed out as a possible factor in airplane accidents. It observed that a person who drinks alcohol while in a fasting state, having missed one or more meals, “may experience severe hypoglycemic symptoms including convulsions and coma.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some persons with low blood sugar might think it would be all right to use sugarless, artificial sweeteners, but it seems that these too ought to be avoided. According to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font0"> of April 29, 1961, these sugarless sweeteners stimulate the insulin-producing cells because “the sweet taste alone becomes enough to set in motion the physiological events that ordinarily follow eating sugar. Insulin is released in the body. There is greater utilization of glucose and decreased glycogen breakdown. The end result is a lowering of blood sugar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The special diet for persons with hypoglycemia may last for about three months. Eventually the person can go back to a more normal selection of foods with possibly a few restrictions. One of those restrictions will undoubtedly be moderation when eating sweets in order to avoid getting the islands of Langerhans overly sensitive again. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and soft drinks might be forbidden entirely or put under strict limitations. Of course, such a diet and the restrictions following it will likely vary according to the physician prescribing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since emotional stress is a factor in bringing on hypoglycemic attacks, a diet cannot entirely solve the problem if nothing is done to relieve such stress. In some cases it may be just a matter of exercising self-control by not permitting things to upset one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A person may tend to meet situations in life with such emotions as anxiety, fear, apprehension, discouragement, disappointment and frustration, all of which can cause emotional stress. It would be much better to learn how to meet situations with less disturbing emotions. When something happens about which a person can do nothing, he might as well resign himself to the situation and make the best of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For low blood sugar to be accurately diagnosed it is best to go to a physician and have him test for it. This is more advisable than for one to try to diagnose the trouble oneself. Then if low blood sugar exists, the physician can explain the diet that is best for treating it. If it is due to a tumor he will be in a better position than the patient to determine this and to recommend an effective treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Low blood sugar is a problem with many people and has caused them much distress. If you have severe headaches, extreme fatigue, feel very hungry shortly after eating a meal and have tenderness on the left side of the abdomen, do not overlook the possibility that low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, may be your problem.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!&quot; correspondent in Ghana</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AIT until tomorrow before you leave, Jim. There is going to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a formal reception of chiefs, and it is interesting. You’ll see the traditional rulers gorgeously dressed in the best native attire. They’ll wear golden crowns, have bracelets of gold from the wrist right up to the elbow, and each chief will sit under a brightly patterned state umbrella.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Really? I would like to see it. But when I decided to come to visit I read up a bit on Ghana. One book gave me the impression that you don’t have traditional chiefs anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Oh, but we do! It’s true that the chief today does not exercise the degree of power he did before our present century. Before the establishment of the colonial regime in this country the chiefs were the dominant figures. They were responsible for the maintenance of law and for the administration of their respective localities. But the political government now largely has taken over these duties, greatly reducing the chiefs’ political strength. However, the traditional institution of chieftaincy still exists because there is a religious aspect to the office that is considered even more important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“A chief, after his election and installation, is regarded as a person ‘who sits upon the stool of his ancestors.’ The stool upon which he sits is considered sacred; thus the occupant is accorded reverence.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690608_files/g_E_19690608-11.png" alt="" style="width:212pt;height:184pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">en away from him, he will still have the religious functions to perform.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I see. But before I forget, what is this stool that he occupies?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Briefly, the stool is the symbol of authority. In some traditional areas, as in northern Ghana, a skin is the symbol instead of a stool. In either case, it represents the solidarity, identity and continuity of the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“So the stool or the skin is like a throne, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“In a way, yes. A king is spoken of as being enthroned and dethroned, but with a chief we speak of enstooling and destooling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Tell me, Kofi, how does a person qualify to be a chief?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Qualifications of a Chief</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Well, Jim, not just anybody can groom himself to qualify for an appointment. You have to be in the royal line even to be considered as a potential successor to the stool. Among the family lines of our people there is always a royal line. It is from this line that the chief is selected.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“So if you are not born in a royal line you do not qualify to be chief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So even if all the political powers are tak-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That’s right. There are other require-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">merits, of course, but this is the first one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“On this point of being born in the royal family, if a man from a royal line gets married to a woman from another line, not a royal line, will their sons be viewed as potential successors to the stool?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Well, this depends upon the tribe. There are two or three tribes in the country that trace their Une of descent through the father. In such tribes, if the father is from a royal family, the children have an opportunity to become chief. But all the other tribes trace their line of descent through the mother. Thus in these tribes a chief’s potential successors are first his brothers in order of age, then his sister’s son, his sister’s daughter’s son, his sister’s daughter’s daughter’s son, and so on.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That’s interesting! It is opposite to what people in Europe are acquainted with. Now, what I would like to know is how the royal lines were established. Back in ancient Israel it was God who showed what family line would be the royal line, but in your society how were these lines established?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That's a good question. But to be honest, Jim, I don’t remember. However, that old man there is one of the elders of this town. He may be able to tell us. Would you like me to ask him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Oh, yes! I’m interested.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Nana, I was talking to my friend about our traditional chiefs and he asked me something that I don’t remember. He asked how the royal families were established.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Well, generally speaking, the royal family line in any locality is the line whose ancestors first appeared on that particular section of the land. Some came from distant places to settle, others appeared on these lands from holes in the ground, some from the sea, and so forth. Since the land was then uninhabited, the first people to appear on it became the owners and rulers of that land. Of course, there are others who established themselves as rulers through wars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Thank you very much, Nana. Yes, now I remember, it is the line whose ancestors first settled on the land that became the rulers. Even today one of the secular functions of the chief is that of custodian of tribal lands. When a new chief is elected it is made sure that he knows the extent of the stool lands, their exact boundaries, the strangers occupying portions of the land and what they pay annually in the form of tributes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“This is clear. But, Kofi, was the old man saying that some of your ancestors came out of holes in the ground?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Well, there are many stories like that in the traditions of the various tribes, but such stories are not taken too seriously anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“But did the people once believe it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Yes, some did.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“How did the stories originate? There must be some basis for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Yes. In all these stories, which persist particularly among the prominent Ashanti tribe, there seems to be some basis. One historian said that perhaps what really happened was that the Ashantis were powerful at first, then were defeated by a stronger people, after which they took to hiding in secret places such as dens and caves. Then upon becoming stronger again, they started coming out of these dens and caves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That’s an interesting explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reliffious Functions of Chiefs</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Oh, yes, before I forget. Earlier you spoke about the religious functions of the chief. You mentioned that he still has religious duties to perform.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Yes. You see, a chief is viewed as the representative of his royal ancestors, who are believed to be alive somewhere in an invisible realm. It is believed, too, that the people are protected by the spirits of the dead ancestors, and that the well-being of society depends upon the maintenance of good relations with these ancestors. So while the chief’s duty is to maintain amicable relations among members of the community, he is also to maintain good relations between the people and their dead ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“When a number of deaths take place within a short time in a locality, it is reported to the chief and he, through the fetish priest, endeavors to find the cause of these deaths. Usually it is determined that the ancestral spirits are angry. Therefore, the chief offers sacrifices to pacify them and reestablish good relations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“You mean that he sacrifices to the dead?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“How do the subjects who are Christians feel about this?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Well, there are many who profess to be Christian and still believe that the ancestors send help and blessings. Thus they share in these ceremonies. In fact, there is a case where a onetime clergyman of Christendom became a chief and started offering these sacrifices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Kofi, you practice Christianity. What do you do when such customs are performed?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I stay away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Doesn’t it make it difficult for you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Well, people who don’t appreciate the Christian stand may speak abusively, but nobody is forced to share in such ceremonies,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I see.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“On other occasions, however, a chief may forbid the doing of certain things on certain days, saying that doing them will bring misfortune upon the entire community. For instance, he may say that the ancestral spirits do not want the land to be worked on a certain day of the week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“What do you do in a case like that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“There are many things a person can do at home. So I simply stay home and do something else.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“And doing this doesn’t mean you share their views.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Not at all. The idea is not to oppose the chiefs if obedience to them does not cause one to violate the laws of God. They are recognized by the government as rulers, and they should be respected. Besides, we benefit from their administration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Oh, I am so glad we stayed tonight. I’ve enjoyed talking about this subject and I’m looking forward to getting up early tomorrow to see the chiefs.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Catholic Priest's Recommendation</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">t* A man walked into a Kingdom Hall in Arizona. He identified himself as a Catholic who had been instructed by his priest to attend the meetings of Jehovah's witnesses. Does this sound strange? Well, here is how it happened: This man was searching for God’s truth, so he asked his priest to teach him more about the Bible. The priest said that he could not teach him the Bible's truth but that he could find it at the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. The man borrowed the priest’s Bible and went to the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Later, the man visited the priest, who asked him, “How is it going?’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The man replied: “Three months ago I attended my first meeting with Jehovah’s witnesses and I have not missed a meeting of theirs yet. I want to be baptized as one of them!”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ehovah’s witnesses are well known for their courage and zeal in Spain, a predominately Catholic country. They have endured much for their holding to their Bible-founded convictions. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font17"> of July 19, 1967, observed regarding their treatment •.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690608_files/g_E_19690608-12.png" alt="" style="width:156pt;height:117pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">“In Spain's pecking order the people who suffer the greatest hardship are the Jehovah’s Witnesses. They suffer from the general humiliations heaped on all non-Catholies in that country and in addition are spurned by many Protestants who view the faith and practice of Jehovah’s Witnesses with suspicion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Also, due to their strict obedience to Bible requirements, Jehovah's witnesses frequently are arrested and imprisoned by Spanish authorities. Regarding this treatment, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font17"> goes on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;In its attempt to break the will of conscientious men by keeping them in perpetual jeopardy Spanish law violates the most elementary axioms of humaneness and justice. Yet there is no outcry either by Roman Catholics or by Protestants against this perfidious mistreatment of human beings. . . . Even a mutilated and dying bull is cheered by Spaniards if he makes a noble charge. But there is no cheering for courageous people who take a noble stand for personal freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Recently, however, an article by a prominent Catholic was published in Spain that acknowledged and spoke well of the courage and zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses. The article appeared in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Triunfo</span><span class="font17"> magazine and was entitled &quot;Protestants That Are Not Protestants.&quot; The writer, Enrique Miret Magdalena, General Secretary of the National Union of Secular Apostolate, observed in the introduction :</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“When I speak to a Catholic in Spain, whether an acquaintance or a stranger, and ask if he has dealt with Protestants, very often the answer is that they have, and that they are called Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The people know them, above all, because they go from house to house carrying on their campaign of propagation, and now and then they have visited them or perhaps a neighbor or friend ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“However, these adherents of the Bible, despite what people may believe, do not consider themselves Protestants, nor do they like to be considered as just another Christian group, although they do believe they are Christian witnesses of Jehovah.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The article went on to speak of the tremendous influence of the comparatively few Witnesses, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Their followers in Spain amount to only 5,500. A small and insignificant amount, but one, nevertheless, that causes many uneasiness because of their tenacity and influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;There is basis for this concern on the part of average Catholics and Protestants, since their house to house propaganda, organized according to their experience in America, has proved highly efficient.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But why have Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed such success? Why have many sincere, Godfearing persons been moved to join them in their Christian work? The article pointed to the reason when it said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;The Witnesses believe that they must imitate the first apostles of Christianity who, as Doctor Luke states in the book of Acts, ‘went from house to house.’ [Acts 5:42; 20:20] . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“They have no images or special cults, just Bible reading and study. They only use water baptism and they practice it by Immersion, as Jesus did in the river Jordan. . . .’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yes, the reason for their success is that Jehovah's witnesses adhere closely to the Bible and the example of Jesus Christ. Their life and worship are governed closely by what Almighty God says in his Word. And when truth seekers find such an organization of people, with courage and zeal they join them in true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I</span><span class="font0"> LOOKED at my watch. It was one o’clock in the afternoon. As</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I excused myself to go pick up the mail my North American visitor exclaimed, “But today is Sunday!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“I know it is,” I replied. “But we have airmail boxes that are open on Sundays from nine in the morning until six in the evening, and mail is deposited in them on Sundays,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That brief conversation got us going on a discussion of the unique airmail system that has operated in Colombia since 1920. It gives fast, efficient and dependable service of which Colombia’s residents</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690608_files/g_E_19690608-13.png" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:193pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">can rightly be proud. After traveling in thirty-six countries I have not found a system that quite compares to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the airmail box we found the letter I had been expecting, along with other correspondence, and we checked the postmark: BROOKLYN FEB 14 PM 1969— just two days ago. A letter from Valparaiso, Chile, was mailed just the day before, and another letter, from Plato, Magdalena, Colombia, had been mailed and delivered the same day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“With such fast service,” I observed, “it can be appreciated why the airmail system is so popular in Colombia. It is true,” I continued, “that the Government is taking a greater interest in the National mail, updating the post offices and striving for better service. The people recognize and appreciate this trend but, at the same time, they are cognizant of the advantages the airmail system gives. It provides, for example, two or three deliveries to the homes a day, and special delivery mail receives four to twelve deliveries a day depending on the arrival time of the planes. Also, registered airmail and airmail money order services are provided.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“With all these services,” our visitor interrupted, “it must be expensive to mail a letter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Not really,” I countered. “Domestic airmail costs about a nickel for each twenty grams. For delivery outside the country the price varies according to the weight of the mail and the continent to which it is going. Airmail to the United States, for instance, is about ten and a half cents for a letter. And a letter from the United States requires fifteen cents in postage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That is interesting! But, what I would like to know,” pondered my visitor, “is what caused Colombia to develop an airmail system long before other countries? And how can two distinct mail systems operate in a country without conflict of interests?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I, too, was interested in the answers to such questions. So we sought to contact a person who could help us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Rewarding Interview</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Airmail Administrator graciously received us into his private office, and over small cups of black coffee he kindly provided the information for which we were looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The geographic situation of the country dictated the need for more rapid mail delivery,” he began. “With the towering Andes range of mountains extending the length of Colombia, transportation from the Caribbean and Pacific coasts to the interior mountain-locked capital, Bogota, was very difficult. It required two or three weeks for letters to arrive from the seaports. Hence, the initiation of airmail service was practically simultaneous with the establishing of the first airline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“That airline was SCADTA, now AVI-ANCA,” our host explained. “It was founded December 5, 1919, in Barranquilla. The following year it received permission from the Government to carry mail in its two Junker planes. These made more or less regular flights from the coasts to the interior of the country, and they used the great Magdalena River as their landing strip. Colombia was actually the pioneer of international airmail service, even beginning such service before the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">My North American visitor was duly impressed by this information. But now we asked: “What relationship exists between the Airmail system and the Colombian government and its National mail system?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“There exists a close collaboration between Airmail and National mail,” our host responded. “National mail addressed to Airmail boxes is distributed by our personnel without any extra charge. At the same time, Airmail correspondence is reexpedited, handled and delivered by National mail in the cities where Avianca has no office.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Airmail Administrator continued: “To ensure the fulfillment of International and National Postal rules and the requirements of the Ministry of Communications, government supervisors keep watch over Airmail, and at the same time coordinate relations between the Airmail Administration and the National Postal Administration. As long as Avianca gives good service and fulfills its obligations, Government contracts are periodically renewed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Does Avianca use other airlines in the transport of airmail?” we asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Yes, it uses almost all the domestic airlines and all the airlines that operate between Colombia and the cities around the world,” the Airmail Administrator explained. “Our policy is to dispatch mail in the first plane that will get it to its destination the fastest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“For example,” he continued, “a letter destined for New York city takes the following route: It is dropped into the mailbox labeled EXTERIOR; a mail truck collects the mail and transports it to the Mail Dispatch Section at the airport. There the stamps are canceled; it is classified according to destination, bundled and the corresponding protective documents are made out. Then it is turned over to the airline for transport. In New York city the airline turns the mail over to the local postal authorities whose responsibility it is to get the mail to its destination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We thanked our host. The visit had indeed been rewarding. When my visitor returned to North America I could not help but think that among his impressions of Colombia would be a respect for an efficient airmail system.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">host Visits Hospital.” This was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">\_T </span><span class="font0">the title of a leading article in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail</span><span class="font0"> of January 15, 1969, in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The article reported that a woman who died about a month after giving birth was alleged to have visited the hospital, asking permission from the watchman to see her baby. According to the report, when another watchman, who knew that the woman had died, arrived at the scene, the woman left. The first watchman was then told that the woman had been dead. He chased her but she suddenly disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Frequently persons hear about dead persons returning temporarily as “ghosts.” Many sincere ones believe that the souls of dead persons materialize as “ghosts” from time to time and are seen and heard. This is based on the ancient Babylonian idea that the dead are conscious somewhere in the spirit realm. What does God say about this? Why not get your Bible and read Ecclesiastes 9:5? If yours is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font0"> you will note that it reads: “The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing.” God says that the human soul is mortal and that the dead cannot perform any activity. (Eccl. 9:10; Ezek. 18:4) Obviously, therefore, “ghosts” are not dead humans who return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">■’ How, then, can one explain the appearance of “ghosts”? In some instances it has proved to be simply a case of mistaken identity. Often there are persons who strongly resemble other persons in their features. For example, recently a missionary in Africa called on a home and she was mistaken for a doctor whom she resembles. If she had left when the householder ran to announce the 'doctor’s’ arrival to other family members, and if the doctor, who worked far away, happened to have died just prior to the missionary’s visit, the missionary could have been mistaken for the doctor’s “ghost.” Incidents similar to this are responsible for many “ghost” stories in certain localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>4</sup> On the other hand, sometimes misinformation is responsible for persons believing they have seen “ghosts.” For example, two witnesses of Jehovah called at a home in Sierra Leone, Africa, where a Bible study was to be held. They found the interested woman absent. They were shocked when the neighbors told them that the woman went to her native village in the interior and had suddenly died there. Later when the Witnesses were in the same area, they were astonished to find the woman whom they believed to be dead sitting on her veranda. They investigated and found that it was the woman’s mother who had suddenly died, and not her. A similar investigation would end some “ghost” stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>B</sup> Someone may ask, “Did not Jesus appear as a ‘ghost’ after his death?” No, he did not appear as the “disembodied spirit” of a dead person. He was very much alive, having been resurrected from the dead by God. For forty days thereafter Jesus appeared in different materialized bodies to suit each occasion. At times he was recognized by his followers and at other times he was not. They even touched him. (Luke 24:13-16, 28-31; John 20:14-16; 21: 1, 4-7, 12) Jesus was not a “ghost.” His appearances were not shrouded in mystery but were open and before many witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus showed himself to his followers to give them positive proof that God had raised him from the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>8</sup> Are you wondering about the “ghost” of the dead prophet Samuel that appeared to King Saul when he visited the witch of En-dor? Why not turn to 1 Samuel 28:7-20? Note that King Saul only assumed that what the witch saw was Samuel from the description that she gave him of what she saw. Because he could not contact Jehovah, Saul desperately wanted to believe it was Samuel, yes, he was willing to be deceived by resemblances. Who, then, was it that was impersonating Samuel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>7</sup> The Bible shows that it was one of the demons. Of the chief of these demons the Bible says: “Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.” (2 Cor. 11:14) Hence the one who spoke to Saul was a lying spirit, a demon. His prediction was based on fraud and deception. Just as King Saul fooled the witch of En-dor about his identity, so the demon caused the medium to see a “god” coming out of the earth, tricking both her and Saul by mimicking Samuel’s former voice and appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>6</sup> Although the dead are unconscious, the wicked spirits are very much alive and active today. Since their recent ouster from heaven by the forces of God’s established Kingdom, these wicked demons have been confined to the vicinity of our earth. Their time is very short. Now more than ever they are actively causing every kind of deception, including impersonating dead persons. They want to induce people to believe wrongly that “ghosts” are the souls of dead persons who have materialized and that the human soul is immortal.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>0</sup> So if a dead person appearing as a “ghost” is not a case of mistaken identity or the result of mistaken information, we can be certain that it is one of the demons deliberately trying to mislead persons, It should never be forgotten that Satan and his demons are determined to do all they can to turn as many of mankind as possible away from the pure worship of Jehovah God. They will resort to any design to accomplish this. Religions that teach the doctrine of the immortality of the human soul are not teaching in harmony with God’s Word. Staying with them is dangerous. Why? Because they lay their followers open to be ensnared by the deceptive designs of the spirit enemies of God and men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>10</sup> In this time of extreme urgency, honest-hearted persons do well to guard against being duped about stories concerning “ghosts.” They should put their complete faith in Jehovah God and his Holy Word, the Bible. Doing this will free them from such false ideas that can lead them into death and destruction. As Jesus Christ said, “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”—John 8:31, 32,</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Church Authority Challenged </span><span class="font17">+ The Roman Catholic Church has operated with a clear line of command starting with the papacy. In the wake of the Second Vatican Council, many of the past assumptions and policies of the church are now being challenged. In April, 31 Brooklyn priests made it clear that they see the Catholic church in more democratic terms—or at least as a sort of large family in which every member has a voice in decisions. These priests announced that they no longer considered themselves bound by the church’s 800-year-oId regulation that priests may not marry. How have such events affected Catholics? A Prominent Jesuit theologian, Walter J. Burghardt, said: “I myself have entered a stage of profound uncertainty, of anguished confusion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Reject $18,000 a Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A new contract that would have paid steam fitters in Philadelphia $18,000 a year by 1971 was rejected. Members now earn $6 an hour, which also pays for pensions, hospitalization and vacations. A new plumbers’ contract with the Mechanical Association of Philadelphia increases hourly pay to nearly $9, including the fringes. In San Francisco plumbers reportedly make as high as $10.65 an hour. That is about $425 a week, not counting overtime!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Teen-Age Killers</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A gang of teen-agers belonging to a group called the “Wolf Pack” preyed on elderly persons in New York. Five of the youths were arrested on April 26 in an investigation of the robbery and murder of a 63-year-old Welfare Department porter. The boys stabbed him to death after robbing him of 60 cents. One of the hoys confessed that they had purchased French fried potatoes with the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Bald Eagle Threatened</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">•$&gt; Pesticides are threatening the American bald eagle with extinction. Sometimes the chemicals prevent it from reproducing. The eagle eggs in pesticide areas had produced no shells. Alexander Sprunt IV, research director of the National Audubon Society, said, “Unless we ban DDT the American eagle will become extinct.” Incidentally, the bald eagle is not bald at all. Its head is covered with white feathers that make it look bald at a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Atlantic Salmon</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"># Of the 220 tagged salmon so far recovered in the nets of Greenland fishermen, the majority came from Canadian and two from Maine rivers. Two Canadian fish, tagged as smolts, traveled 1,500 to 1,800 nautical miles In 16 to 18 months, and two adults journeyed 1,265 miles in 124 months. Such fish, say the biologists, have the stamina of racehorses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Cholera Increases</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; There were 28,941 cases of cholera reported last year by the World Health Organization. This figure represents a 25-percent increase over 1967 in the often-fatal intestinal disease. The disease is concentrated in south Asia, with India and Pakistan having contributed 88 percent of last year’s world total, according to WHO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Nuclear War Warning</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt; Lin Piao, the Chinese Communist Defense Minister, warned the Chinese that the United States or the Soviet Union might launch “a large-scale nuclear war,” perhaps soon. He said China feels that it must make preparations against such a possibility. Lin believes war is inevitable unless forestalled by Communist revolution. He called the United States &quot;the most ferocious enemy of the people of the whole world” and urged nations and peoples to &quot;unite and form the broadest possible united front and overthrow our common enemies.” Thus we see nations locked in bitter hatred of one another as they march toward Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Holding Parents Responsible</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; New York legislators approved a bill that holds parents responsible for up to $500 for acts of vandalism committed by their children. Under the bill’s provisions, a Family Court judge could also, as a condition of probation, order a youth guilty of vandalism to work off damages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Uncle Sam a Waster</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The horrible truth,” said a high-ranking career official of the General Accounting Office of the United States government, &quot;is that neither the President nor Congress nor anyone else really Knows enough about what the government is doing and what results its programs are achieving, to speak with certainty about how much waste there is in our $200 billion a year federal budget.” When pressed for an estimate, he said $20,000,000,000 to $30,000,000,000 a year would be a &quot;realistic guess.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">“Don’t Lead in Morality”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The religious institutions of Christendom are no longer a &quot;mouthpiece of morality,” said W. A. Pyatt, Anglican Bishop of Christchurch, New Zealand. “It was assumed that the Church was the mouthpiece of morality, and according to her standing at a particular time, men did or did not follow her directions. Generally speaking this is no longer true,” he said. &quot;The Church is finding it difficult to find universal standards of morality.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteousness Without Church </span><span class="font17">^Dennis Braithwaite, writing for </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Telegram</span><span class="font17"> (Toronto, Can.), April 7, said; &quot;It is my conviction that if I need righteousness (I know I do) and if I want it badly enough, then all I have to do is become righteous. Going to church isn’t going to make any difference.&quot; But whose standards of righteousness will he seek— man’s or God’s? To seek God’s he will have to turn to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Church “a Rat-Hole”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Roman Catholic Jesuit priest John L. Mackenzie, who teaches at Notre Dame University, had a few things to say about his church and the people in it. The Roman Catholic Church, he said, is run by “an ecclesiastical Mafia.” Cardinal O'Boyle of Washington, D.C., has treated dissident priests in ways &quot;revolting to every Christian and civilized principle.” And even Boston's jovial Cardinal Cushing has “the manners of the barnyard and the ethics of a slave owner.” Mackenzie makes the point that Catholic priests are defecting because they are disgusted with the abuses and corruption in the church. His statements appeared in the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">National Catholic Reporter,</span><span class="font17"> a weekly published by laymen in Kansas City. Mackenzie, noting that the struggle is a painful one for priests, likened the institutional church today to a rathole, adding; &quot;And one does not like to hear that one has poured one’s life into a rat-hole.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">257 U.S. Earthquakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There were 257 significant earthquakes in 21 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in 1968, and nobody was killed. The rest of the world was not as fortunate, however. Twenty earthquakes took 12,401 lives in 13 other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Priest Dropouts</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; An article in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Herder Correspondence,</span><span class="font17"> a Roman Catholic magazine printed in England, quotes figures to show that in the United States, 465 priests resigned from the active ministry during the first nine months of 1968, compared with 480 during the whole of 1967, out of a total of nearly 60,000. In the Netherlands, where there are nearly 8,000 priests, 700 have left the ministry since 1964. Where figures are available, they are alarming, the article says. The most fundamental cause for disquiet among priests is covered by the following statement from the article: &quot;We lack a theology of the priesthood that carries conviction in the contemporary world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Destruction by Technology</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Vice-Admiral Hyman Rick-over, whose development work made him known as the father of the United States nuclear submarine, warned </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">man at a </span><span class="font17">symposium on “Automation </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font17">Society” that unbridled use of technology “may become a Frankenstein destroying its creator.” “Never before has man possessed such enormous power to injure his human fellows and his society as has been put into his hands by modem technology.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Suicide Is Pound Second</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"># Dr. </span><span class="font17">Mathew Ross, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard’s medical school, said that only automobile accidents took the lives of more college students than suicides. Suicide is listed as the second-greatest cause of death among college students and the third-greatest among youths of high-school age. A feature often found in the background of those who attempt suicide, Dr. Ross said, is &quot;some kind of social isolation, most often </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font17">disorganized home or a breakdown of family structure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Taking It on the Chin</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Ten years ago, an average white-collar worker in America paid out 27 percent of his income in direct taxes. Tax Foundations, Inc., points out that the present figure is 34 percent. In ten years the white-collar worker’s Federal taxes have climbed 71.3 percent, his state taxes 260.9 percent and his local taxes 120.5 percent. And, his taxes on property have risen 114 percent. With consumer prices up 20 percent since 1958, whitecollar employees are taking it on the chin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Alcoholism Is Expensive</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$■ The United States reportedly has some 3,000,000 alcoholics who spend almost $7,500,000,000 a year on liquor—five times the profits of General Motors for 1968!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Organized Crime Costs</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;§&gt; Estimates of the &quot;take” from illegal gambling alone in the United States run anywhere from $20,000,000,000 to $50,000,000,000, a figure larger than the entire Federal ad* ministrative budget for fiscal year 1951. This wealth is but one yardstick of the economic and political power held by the leaders of organized crime who operate within American society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Violence and Television</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">$&gt; The National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence in America reveals that the average American between his second and sixtyfifth year spends 3,000 entire days (almost nine years of his life) watching television. By the time a five-year-old child enters kindergarten he has spent more time learning about life from the family TV set than the average student in a liberal arts program spends in a classroom in his four years of college. Based on a recent average week of TV programing, an incident of violence is enacted every 14 minutes and a killing every 45 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Shoplifting</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Shoplifters are looting honest merchants in the United States at an estimated rate of $5,000,000,000 every year! And many of these thieves are supposedly respectable men, women and teen-agers. They are reportedly often active church members, too,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">High Cost of Medicine</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; A hospital room in America costs on an average $60 a day, more than the fanciest resort hotel room. Each year 130,000,000 Americans pay 500,000,000 visits to the doctors. The doctor writes some 1,000,000,000 prescriptions for a total drug bill of about $3,500,000,000. The total cost of United States medical care is now $53,000,000,000 a year, 7.5 percent of all personal income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Television and Talking</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&amp; Too much television is affecting the speech of children, is the conclusion of a group of London schoolteachers. Growing numbers of children beginning school can barely talk, say the teachers. And they urge parents to take strong, remedial action: less television and more time talking with their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Atheism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Martin Marty, editor of the magazine </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Century, </span><span class="font17">said technology has shoved God far into the background, and the concept of the Deity is figuring less and less in modern man’s religious beliefs. He said people talk quite frequently about religion, but seldom do they desire to talk about God. Even seminarians can go through their studies “with or without God,” he said.</span></p>
