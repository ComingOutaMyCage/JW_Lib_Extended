<p><span class="font1">fi£T IKE a recurrent nightmare, the </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">I </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">j</span><span class="font1"> bloody, clamorous, now familiar scenes were enacted again last week,” declared </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Helicopters clattered overhead broadcasting calls for surrender; tear gas billowed and missiles flew,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font1"> reported. It noted that “a deluge of rocks, Molotov cocktails, bottles of sulphuric acid and lengths of pipe” met the attackers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Were these descriptions of the latest action in the Vietnam War? No, these were two reports, the first from the United States and the second from Japan, of another kind of war. This war is the one that has erupted on school campuses, especially colleges, all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From nation after nation come reports of students on the rampage. They are demonstrating, smashing and rioting in revolt against the established order. This student revolt gathers momentum in all parts of the world. Even students in the Communist countries of Eastern Europe are involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Japan, about 90 percent of the universities have been affected. Earlier this year, 8,000 Japanese police stormed Tokyo University to try to bring an end to a yearlong, violent student strike in that school. At one point, the dean of the faculty of letters was held prisoner in his office for eight days by the revolting students! Using tear gas, helicopters, water cannons, blowtorches, and other weapons, the police finally battered and burned down the student barricades. They arrested 631. The aftermath was described by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font1"> in this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&quot;The damage was so extensive that Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, a 1924 graduate himself, wept when he visited the scene. Dazed professors walked through ravaged offices and laboratories, ankle-deep in rubble and water. Even the marble wall of the main entrance had been broken up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Last year a protest begun by French students engulfed the entire nation in disorder. Near panic took hold in much of the nation. Only very narrowly did France avert total collapse. Before last year's Olympic Games, thousands of Mexican students rioted against their government. In the ensuing clashes, dozens were killed and hundreds injured. In Czechoslovakia, student revolts after the Russian occupation last August caused even the Czech leaders to plead with students for restraint. They feared massive Russian retaliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States, news sources almost daily report disturbances on campuses all over the country. One week’s report by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font1"> this year included the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&quot;California state police cracked student heads at Berkeley (and activists swung back with their own billy clubs); 900 Wisconsin National Guard troops, bayonets fixed, prodded students on the streets and hilly campus of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and panicky authorities at Southern, affluent, predominantly white Duke University—confronted with a minor rebellion by some 60 black students—-fired tear-gas canisters on the center of campus— and succeeded in outraging hundreds of white students who had been previously uninvolved bystanders.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In another typical week, student rebellion and violence were reported on at least fifteen college campuses and several high schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why this rising tide of student revolt? What are their goals? What do they seek to accomplish? What is behind it all? Where will it all end?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690522_files/g_E_19690522-3.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:131pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>tf//AT</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"> «&gt;» ‘he <sub>f </sub>' students want?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S</span><span class="font1">OME authorities hint that student upheavals are due to a worldwide Communist conspiracy. But Communist countries themselves have their own student disorders. So it does not appear that any one ideology can be blamed for all this trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True, radical forces are likely to try to take advantage of these rebellions when they occur. But instead of any ideological unity, there appears to be a great diversity of issues, even within any one country. There does not appear to be any one key issue or demand that unites all students everywhere. More often the revolts are due to local issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Issues</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One specific issue that comes closest to being universal in many countries has to do with the war in Vietnam. Students the world over are generally united in their demand that this war cease. In the United States in particular, students strongly express disapproval, often violently. It is rare to find a student who approves of escalating the Vietnam War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Aside from the Vietnam War, another recurring theme among many students in different countries is the desire to get a larger voice in college affairs. Students are directly affected by what a college does and teaches, so they feel they should have a strong voice in determining school policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For instance, in Japan, Tokyo University students protested the old order, that is, what they claimed were outdated lectures, a too-rigid administration and professors who were too distant from their students. The Tokyo University students also demanded a larger share of authority in school planning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In France, students protested that their country’s educational system is archaic. In Mexico it was a protest against what was regarded as government repression of students and the heavy-handed methods of riot police. In the famed London School of Economics, closed by student turmoil for twenty-six days this year, students demanded reform of the school’s constitution, which they considered ancient and outmoded. They also protested crowded conditions, old buildings and the lack of student involvement in policy-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States, many of these same factors were involved. In addition, students have protested against research projects in their schools when these projects were sponsored by the government and related to the war-making potential of the country. They have also voiced disapproval in the appointment or dismissal of various teachers. They have even demonstrated against the recruiting practices of industrial firms on their campuses. And one demonstration was conducted at Wichita State University in Kansas to protest protests!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, in the United States there was another burning issue on college campuses, and even in high schools—the demands of Negro students. It is felt by many that the civil rights struggles of Negroes in the 1950’s and early 1960’s have moved onto the school campuses. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font1"> of February 10, 1969, expressed it this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Today, the revolt has redefined itself, its goals—and its battleground. The aim of the student vanguard is black independence and the dominant cry is for black pride. The battlegrounds have changed too. ‘The universities,’ says Dr. Price M. Cobbs, a black psychiatrist and co-author of ‘Black Rage,’ ‘have become the dusty Southern towns of today.’ . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Black college students—like many white students on campus today—want to claim their own identity. They want a curriculum that will help them better serve their communities. They want institutions that let them control their own lives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence, Negro students have demanded more courses on black history and culture, courses dealing with the Negro struggles in the city ghettos and for civil rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Other Side of the Coin</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is also the other side to the coin of student demands. We are not to think that all the students’ demands are based on the highest idealism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When students at the University of South Carolina protested taking only required courses, they were allowed to have their pick of short courses on lovemaking, witchcraft, premarital sex, bartending, and others. One student said: “Lovemaking is the most popular course so far. There won’t be any labs though, just theory, but I imagine they’ll have to hold the class in Carolina Coliseum to accommodate everybody who wants to get in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recently there was a demand for coeducational dormitories. To dramatize this demand, about 100 Barnard College girls moved into two men’s dormitories at Columbia University, to the delight of the men students and the dismay of many parents and teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then there is the desire of students to have freedom to experiment with various types of drugs. Some take LSD “trips.” While there are often restrictions and disciplinary measures against the use of drugs on college campuses, an increasing number of students feel they should have the freedom to experiment with drugs, and are taking them. They also regard sexual freedom as their right, as evidenced by mounting immorality, venereal diseases and pregnancies in colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Common Denominator</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whatever the issues or demands; whether the students are white, black, yellow or brown; whether their schools are in Europe, Asia, Africa or the Americas, there is one pattern emerging that is common to all: The day of the quiet, legal, orderly protest alone is gone. In its place has come the use of brute force, often including an ugly, terroristic type of violence that employs the use of deadly weapons such as “Molotov cocktails,” that is, gasoline bombs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the University of California in Berkeley, a fire bomb was thrown on the campus, and student strikers threatened to bum the place down. At two colleges in Claremont, California, two bombs exploded and one employee was severely injured. On March 12, 1969, the New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font1">noted the “adoption of terroristic methods as a substitute for rationality in the pursuit of greater student power,” and added:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“At Rutgers University vandals sprayed academic buildings with noxious liquids, forcing the abandonment of most instruction. At Pomona College in California a staff member was severely injured by a bomb placed in a mail depository. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“At San Francisco State College, a student who apparently was in the process of placing a home-made explosive device was blinded and otherwise horribly maimed. On scores of other campuses the avoidance of serious injury has been a matter of luck rather than restraint by the dissidents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just in recent months, 200 rampaging students at the University of Wisconsin damaged at least nine buildings. They burst into classrooms, smashed the furniture, lights and clocks. They ripped pictures off walls, broke windows and glass doors, set off fire alarms. They even toppled vending machines in the hallways. This was all in conduction with demands of students to establish a degree-granting black studies department. They also demanded admission of Negro students who had been expelled from another university, as well as the admission of 500 new Negro students next term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mounting student violence has also been directed against teachers, especially in high schools. Some teachers have threatened not to teach unless they were guaranteed protection from student assaults. The president of Cornell University, James Perkins, was physically pulled off a platform during a campus discussion, and other instructors have had their classes disrupted by dissident students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Revolting students, particularly those who actually take part in serious disorders and violence, make up only a minority of the population in any given country. While there are many teachers and parents who back the student rebels, what about others? How do the majority feel about students who resort to violence to achieve their ends? Is there a “backlash&quot; developing?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19690522_files/g_E_19690522-4.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:41pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">T</span><span class="font1">HE most impressive counterresponse to the student revolt on the part of many citizens, moderate students, school and government officials is a definite hardening of attitude. Formerly many of these people were sympathetic or patient toward student rebels. But now more and more of them are angered, turn away in disgust, or demand strong action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this regard, U.S. News </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;&nbsp;World Report</span><span class="font1"> of March 10, 1969, stated; “A ‘get tough’ attitude toward students who disrupt colleges and universities is spreading from coast to coast. Opposition to campus rioting is hardening at all levels of government. College administrators are starting to crack down. Some students are showing signs of being disgusted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Officials React</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Typical of the hardening attitude by many officials against revolting students was the remark of State Senator Grady Hazlewood of Texas. He declared that Texas lawmakers “don’t believe a bunch of 18- to 20-year-old kids should run the University of Texas. If the people who run that school can’t throw this bunch of troublemakers off the campus, then the regents will have to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An important official weapon that may be called into use by the United States Justice Department is an anti-riot provision found in the 1968 Civil Rights Act. This provision makes it a Federal crime for anyone to travel across state lines with the intention of rioting, or organizing and inciting a riot. The Federal Bureau of Investigation for some time has been watching student rebels, accumulating evidence for possible future use against ringleaders of such riots.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">DEVELOPING AGAINST STUDENT REBELS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Increasingly, police or government troops are being called onto the campuses to quell student disorders. Force is being met with superior force. When 5,000 Egyptian students took to the streets in resentment against educational policy, officials quickly closed all five of Egypt’s universities and about twenty other institutions. Police were called in to crush the rebels, with an estimated loss of sixteen lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This pattern of calling for crushing force is emerging as one answer to student revolts in many countries. And in Spain the government took a further step to crack down on students and other opposers in the wake of serious disturbances there. Spanish authorities imposed what amounts to virtual martial law in the entire country to bring the situation under control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Public Reacts</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A Gallup poll in the United States asked the public the following question: “Do you think college students who break laws while participating in college demonstrations should be expelled, or not?” Of those answering, 82 percent said Yes. Only 11 percent said No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A second question asked was this: “Would you favor or oppose having Federal loans taken away from students who break laws while participating in campus demonstrations?” To this, 84 percent answered that they favored the withdrawal of funds; 11 percent answered No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A final question was asked: “Do you think college students should or should not have a greater say in the running of colleges?” This brought a 70-percent No. Only 25 percent said Yes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This trend is noted in many other countries, too. It is becoming clear that growing numbers of the public are becoming hostile and impatient with those who promote trouble in the schools. And there are those who now feel that any action, however severe, however restrictive, should be taken to bring order out of the mounting chaos in the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Students and Teachers React</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among students themselves, many are disturbed. These “moderate,” uninvolved students feel that the revolting minority is disrupting their opportunities for education. They resent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When student rebels at the University of Wisconsin gathered at one of the school’s central halls to plan their actions, a nonparticipating student exclaimed: “It was amazing to me to see 500 students in the Great Hall of Memorial Union openly plotting aggression on the campus ... I can’t understand why this is permitted. It could be compared to the U. S. allowing Nazi storm troops to have bases in this country during World War II. Or like a city permitting the Mafia to use the citycouncil chamber.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">School authorities themselves are now far more inclined to crack down hard on rebels. T. M. Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame, outlined a procedure that would be taken against anyone trying to disrupt operations at that university. He included these steps: (1) Anyone or any group that uses force would be given just 15 minutes of meditation to stop. (2) If they do not stop in that time, they will be asked for their identity cards. (3) Those who produce these cards will be temporarily suspended. (4) Those who do not produce identity cards will be assumed not to be members of the community and will be charged with trespassing and disturbing the peace. (5) After notification of suspension of those with cards, and notification of trespassing of those without cards, if the disorder does not stop in just five minutes, participating students will be notified of their expulsion from school. Then the law, with all the force needed, will be called in to deal with them as nonstudents.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This tough stand was hailed by many throughout the country. Even President Nixon, in a personal letter to Notre Dame’s head, commended the action. And at other universities a similar tough stand was being taken and dissenters were being expelled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So, as the student revolts mount, so do opposing reactions. Force is being met with more force. Yet, as is often the case when force is resorted to, hatreds and hostilities escalate instead of subside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The question that sincere persons ask, as do many students who are caught up in this surging tide, is whether the use of force by students is the solution. Are their grievances such that rioting and rampaging is the answer? Is that the way for students to solve problems and injustices? Will that remedy the ills against which they are revolting? If not, what will?</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">CREASING numbers of young people everywhere, especially college and high school students, no longer accept the world that their elders have made. They are rejecting the explanations, methods and organizations that were able to keep young generations of former times in line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One reason this is taking place is that in the past few decades more young people than ever before in history, millions more, have entered colleges and high schools. They have also been exposed to means of communication not available before, such as television. Hence, they see what the world is really like far more quickly than did former generations of young people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With what result? Richard Boeth, in the Detroit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font1"> of October 20, 1968, summed it up by stating bluntly that there was never another time in history “in which the brightest kids in every nation on earth looked around them at the same time and said the hell with all of it.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">From Youth's Viewpoint</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is easy for older persons totally to reject youth’s anger. But consider the situation from youth’s viewpoint. Into what kind of world were they born? They were bom and have been raised in a world filled with violence, war, hatred and prejudice. And who has caused it? The young?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is the older people who have led mankind into the two most horrible wars in history, as well as numerous smaller ones, and all this in just one generation! And who, particularly, had to pay the price? Primarily the young, who had no voice in the decisions. Millions of them were slaughtered and maimed on battlefields made for them by the older generation in authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, the young feel that they have a right to be disgusted with the world that their elders have made. And they now demand to change things by any means available, including violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet, is the road to violence the correct one? Has it righted the many wrongs of the past?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Has Violence Improved Matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you are a young person pondering the tragic events of today, you should consider that the older generation who since 1914 have controlled earth’s affairs were young just like you. Many of them were once idealistic students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They, too, thought that once they grew older and gained control of earth’s affairs they could correct the injustices. Yes, they would solve the problems, right the wrongs and lead people down the road to peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They did grow older. They took control. Now, as the older generation in power, their goals could be noted in the many noble slogans they formed. The air rang with their cries of ‘the war to end war,’ of ‘preserving the world for democracy,’ of ‘prosperity being just around the corner,’ of ‘guaranteeing the four freedoms’ for all mankind. They thought these slogans would become realities by their efforts, since they were in authority and could do something about it And they, too, resorted to violence to achieve their ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yet, look at the world since 1914! What has happened to those dreams? Have the slogans been realized by all this violence? No, they have been dashed to pieces instead. Responsible authorities everywhere now agree that never in history did a generation see such slaughter of innocent men, women and children. Never has starvation threatened so many of earth’s population. Never was there such a worldwide explosion of lawlessness. Never did pollution threaten so seriously the very air we breathe, the water we drink and the land that grows our food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this connection, Mr, Justice Jackson, giving his final testimony at the trial of Nazi war criminals in Nuremberg, Germany, said the following, as recorded in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tyranny on Trial:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“It Is common to think of our own time as standing at the apex of civilization, . . . the reality is that in the long perspective of history the present century will not hold an admirable position .,. These two-score years in the twentieth century will be recorded in the book of years as one of the most bloody in all annals. Two World Wars have left a legacy of dead which number more than all the armies engaged in any war that made ancient or medieval history. No half-century ever witnessed slaughter on such a scale, such cruelties and inhumanities, such wholesale deportations of peoples into slavery, such annihilations of minorities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr. Jackson made these comments in 1946, right after World War II. He also said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“If we cannot eliminate the causes to prevent the repetition of these barbaric events, it is not an irresponsible prophecy to say that this twentieth century may yet succeed in bringing the doom of civilization.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Have barbaric events continued since then? Most assuredly, because since World War n there have been other brutal wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the conflict between Nigeria and Biafra, the Middle East confrontation of Jews and Arabs, just to mention a few. In fact, in the twenty years since Mr. Jackson spoke those words, there have been seventy-three different wars and rebellions fought, according to the Institute for Strategic Studies in London. That is eighteen more than the total number fought in the preceding fifty years put together!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Has all this resulted in people becoming more kind, loving, considerate, honest and dependable? Has it resulted in more happiness to mankind? The opposite is the case, for the facts show that violence and crime of all sorts are increasing like an explosion. No, the idealistic young who grew older and eventually took control before 1914 certainly did not make the world better, nor did any of those who came after them. And for a certainty the violence in which they engaged made the world much worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So if you are a young person, you would do well to face up to the fact that more violence will not change the direction the world is taking. The growing rebellion and skyrocketing lawlessness will not produce law and order. You reap what you sow. The crop being harvested from war, hatred and lawlessness is more of the same. Nor is this just theory. It is what has actually happened in our generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What students often overlook is that those in revolt are not proposing any workable substitute. There is much talk, but enormous disagreement. As the Detroit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font1"> observed on October 21, 1968: “Any political or philosophical discussion among 25 kids in the Movement is sure to turn into an immediate, 25-way shambles.” This is a guaranteed formula for even greater chaos, even greater problems, not solutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">More Just?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you are a student, there is something else to consider. If you resort to violence and this results in the death or injury of other persons, is this really better than what you protest against?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you riot against school injustices and destroy property, is that really more just than the administration’s policies you consider unjust?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Is the retreating into barbarism better than the existing injustices? Do not the smashing, burning, injuring and killing become even greater injustices?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What would be the result if each individual took the law into his own hands when he did not like something? You do not have to wonder what the result would be. This is precisely what has been happening in our time. Look at the results! The world has seen more damage to life and property in our time than ever before in history! It is now close to anarchy in many places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Is this to say that if you stay within legal bounds you will change the course that the world and its rebellious young are taking? No, you will not. Why not? Because nothing is going to change this world’s course. It is going to continue downward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why? Is there a deeper meaning behind all this trouble? Is there greater significance to the revolt of young people taking place now? How does it affect you? What should you do about it for your own welfare?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHAT DOES THE STUDENT REVOLT</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">T</span><span class="font1">HERE is a far deeper meaning to the worldwide student revolt than what may appear on the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is the true meaning? No, you will not find the answer in this world’s news sources, for they do not know. Nor can historians, philosophers, psychiatrists or other such individuals give you the answer, however well meaning they may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Who, then, can tell us the real meaning behind the student revolt? Only this One: ’The One telling from the beginning the finale, and from long ago the things that have not been done.” That description is of Almighty God, Jehovah. It is found in the Bible book of Isaiah, chapter 46, verse 10.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font33" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Really Mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the Creator of man, God knows far better than any human analyst why the student revolt is taking place and what it really means. He also knows what the final result will be. And he has not left sincere, searching persons without this information. He has revealed it in his inspired Word, the Holy Bible.—2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Amos 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Significance of Our Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What does God, who knows ‘the end from the beginning,’ tell us about these chaotic times? In his Word he tells us that our time is the very one foretold in the Bible that would witness the complete end of this entire system of things! Yes, we live in the time that God’s Word calls “the last days.” And just as a road map gives you all the signs and directions needed for you to know exactly where you are, so God’s Word does concerning these “last days.” Notice just a few of the foretold events and attitudes to which we have been eyewitnesses in our day, as recorded at 2 Timothy 3:1-5, 13:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God . . . wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Also, in his great prophecy about the end of this system of things Jesus Christ foretold that our time would be one that would see the “increasing of lawlessness.” (Matt. 24:12) We have seen all these things, and many more!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Note that the Bible foretold ‘disobedience to parents’ and the “increasing of lawlessness.” This includes the general rebellion of the young against their elders, which has resulted in such a tremendous increase of youthful crime. Statistics show that by far the highest increase in the crime rate comes from young people. This is just as God’s Word indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">HTto </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Is Responsible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Who is responsible for the awful condition mankind finds itself in today? The older generation bears its share of responsibility, true. So does the younger generation, since it has contributed much rebellion and lawlessness. But are humans the chief instigators? No, they are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The disorder of our time comes from a more central source. The Bible clearly shows this source to be an unseen mastermind. He is behind the rebellion and violence. He is identified as that corrupted invisible spirit creature “called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Rev. 12:9) True, many do not even believe in his existence. But that suits his plans exactly. In this way he is better able to deceive people and manipulate them to do his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where is his center of operations now? The Bible answers; “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time,&quot; (Rev. 12:12) Along with other wicked spirit creatures called demons, he operates directly among mankind. We see the horrible results of his activity in worsening world conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Satan, as the Bible says, knows God’s time is near for crushing him and all other rebels out of existence. Hence, since Satan knows he cannot rule much longer, he tries to bring all people to ruin. Like a maddened dictator, a Hitler, he wants to take all humankind with him into destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So the prime instigator of all rebellion is not just some political party, ideology or student group. No, but like a sinister Mafia chief, the central mastermind operating behind the scenes is Satan the Devil. The Bible tells us that he is “the god of this system of things.” (2 Cor. 4:4) He has been its ruler for thousands of years now. But soon, this rulership will be ripped away from him. The entire wicked system that he has built up on earth will be annihilated, and he will be silenced in the abyss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Whom Will You Serve?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Satan is the chief rebel against what is right. To serve his foul purposes he uses those on earth who are easiest to incite to rebellion. And who are more susceptible than young persons who have both the energy and the desire to protest against this world’s injustices? This is why the young have been saturated with the spirit of rebellion.—Eph. 2:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you are a young person, ask yourself this question: Do I want to be manipulated by the greatest producer of injustice the world has ever known? If you take part in the lawless revolt of today’s students, then you will allow yourself to come under the influence of the unseen rebel, Satan the Devil. You will become like a puppet in his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That Satan uses revolting students to achieve his end of causing as much ruin as possible can be seen in a quotation from one of the unofficial publications of revolting students. Published in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harvard Business Review,</span><span class="font1"> it urged students to do the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Laugh at professors; disobey your parents; burn your money; you know life is a dream and all of your institutions are man-made illusions effective because you take the dream for reality. The rich are rich because they are thieves and the poor are poor because they are victims . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“What’s needed is a generation of people who are freaky, crazy, irrational, sexy, angry, irreligious, childish and mad; people who burn high-school and college degrees; people who say ‘To hell with your goals’; people who lure youth with music, pot and acid; people who break with the status-role-title-consumer game; people who have nothing material to lose but their flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is precisely the anarchy that Satan sponsors. So how appropriate the warning of God’s Word: “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. But take your stand against him, solid in the faith.” —1 Pet. 5:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How can a person take this stand? Surely not by falling victim to his subtle snares and participating in the lawlessness he sponsors. Instead, the way is to turn to the instructions that God provides for our safety. “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) Such instruction is in God’s Word: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”—Ps. 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This course will bring real, lasting freedom. As Jesus said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32) It will unshackle you from Satan’s sinking system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Injustices Soon to End</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are you incensed at the injustices in the world? Do you want to have something done to end all the oppression, hatred and violence? You are not the only one who longs to see an end to wickedness. Many other persons, old as well as young, also are disgusted with this horrible system of things and want a change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But keep in mind that nothing that you, or any other human, can do will change this world. Bible prophecy shows it will continue to slide toward ever greater anarchy. If you become involved in trying to right wrongs by riots and revolts, you will only bring heartache to yourself. Why? Because no possible lasting good will come of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember, God also sees the injustices in the world: “The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, keeping watch upon the bad ones and the good ones.” (Prov. 15:3) And he most certainly will not let injustice continue indefinitely. He will take decisive action.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">What will he do? God will rid the world of all wickedness by smashing lawlessness, hatred, oppression and injustice. No, he will not use some political party or ideology to accomplish this. He will not allow the substituting of just another failing human system for those systems in power now. Instead, God’s Word guarantees: &quot;[God’s] kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms [the nations], and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”—Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When will this action be taken? All the evidence in fulfillment of Bible prophecy shows that God will bring this system to an end within our generation, indeed before many more years have passed. (Matt. 24:34) That is why the Bible counsel is so appropriate when it says: &quot;Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. .. . Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, . . . just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more.”—Ps. 37:1, 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After that, what? “The upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it.” (Prov. 2:21) Then, under God’s direction, the survivors of this system’s end will begin reconstruction that will bring lasting benefits to humans. God himself will bless obedient humankind, for “he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” (Rev. 21:4) And the psalmist said of God: &quot;You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.” —Ps. 145:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do you think you could improve on that? Could any action you take, or any system you devise, do a more thorough job of ridding the world of what is wrong? That is why God-fearing persons wait upon Jehovah to remedy this world’s ills and to provide man with everlasting benefits. They do not become part of the useless revolts now taking place.—John 17: 16; Jas. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So the student revolt does have far deeper meaning. It is part of the dying gasps of this wicked system. And nothing can save it, for God has determined its end. In view of this, how should honest-hearted young persons consider their future? was a fantastic 17-percent increase In crime over 1967. This came on top of many years of other large increases. The population, however, grew only one percent last year. So crime exploded seventeen times as fast as the population!</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">If you are a young person, you also need to face the fact that you will never grow old in this present system of things. Why not? Because all the evidence in fulfillment of Bible prophecy indicates that this corrupt system is due to end in a few years. Of the generation that observed the beginning of the “last days” in 1914, Jesus foretold: “This generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.”—Matt. 24:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, as a young person, you will never fulfill any career that this system offers. If you are in high school and thinking about a college education, it means at least four, perhaps even six or eight more years to graduate into a specialized career. But where will this system of things be by that time? It will be well on the way toward its finish, if not actually gone!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is why parents who base their lives on God’s prophetic Word find it much more practical to direct their young ones into trades that do not require such long periods of additional schooling. And trades such as carpentry, plumbing, and others, will be useful not only now, but perhaps even more so in the reconstruction work that will take place in God’s new order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With such practical trades, many young persons have been able to sustain themselves with part-time work. This allows them to spend much more of their time helping Interested persons to learn God’s requirements for life by studying the Bible with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True, those who do not understand where we are in the stream of time from God’s viewpoint will call this impractical. But which is really practical: preparing yourself for a position in this world that soon will pass away? or working toward surviving this system’s end and enjoying eternal life in God’s righteous new order? —1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In these urgent times, as this wicked system writhes in its death pangs, this counsel from God’s Word is most practical for all who want to keep living: “My son, my law do not forget, and my commandments may your heart observe, because length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you.”—Prov. 3:1, 2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">♦ The apostle Paul wrote that “fine works are publicly manifest.’’ (1 Tim. 5:25) A witness of Jehovah in California experienced the truthfulness of these words when she began studying the Bible with a woman. At first the woman kept her agreed-upon appointments regularly. Later, the woman began missing some of her studies and at times would not be home when the Witness called. However, the Witness patiently and faithfully persevered, finding her home one time and not home many other times. This went on for months. One month the Witness did not find her home once! On her last call the Witness began to write the woman a little note to leave in her door. A neighbor called to the Witness and the Witness went to see her. The neighbor said to the Witness: &quot;I have watched you call week after week at that house and I have noticed that she is rarely there when you come. I want you to start calling on me. I would like to study the Bible!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font29" style="font-variant:small-caps;">N</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">orthern Ireland is in the news. Recent months have seen civil rights marches, police baton charges, student unrest and violence. What is the reason for all this trouble? Due to the historical and religious background in Ireland there is a deep-rooted suspicion of any movement, as, for instance, the civil rights movement, which might encroach upon the rights and privileges of the established Protestant order. Referring to this background, one Protestant cleric was quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I am bound to express the conviction that the Churches did not make the breakthrough in Christian reconciliation the grim aftermath of those days demanded. That is why the darkness has again descended . . . amid the agony of these days they (the Churches) have been unable to lead disunited people along a new road of unity and peace ... the social gospel in such a situation could not operate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An examination of the historical background of the present unrest will prove illuminating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Historical Background</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ireland has alternated between Catholicism and Protestantism since the Middle Ages, depending on the religious inclinations of the reigning monarch in England, under whose control Ireland came. For example, when Henry vm broke with the papacy he established Protestantism. “Holy” wars followed, wars that were neither holy nor Christian. In the perpetration of these both Catholics and Protestants alike committed acts of hypocrisy, treachery and horror. At the time of James I, starting in 1609, what was called the Plantation of Ulster took place. This consisted of settling in Ireland’s northern province Protestant families from England and Scotland and thus creating a Protestant stronghold in the north of Ireland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;">AWAKE CORRESPONDENT IN IRELAND</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">In 1641 there was an attempted rebellion by the Catholics, who almost became masters of the whole country. It was only after much bloodshed and brutality on both sides that Protestant England gained control under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell. His campaign in Ireland has seared the minds and hearts of Irish Catholics—and many Protestants—with bitterness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under the reign of James n of England, Ireland was once more in ferment. Protestants were weeded out of the army and other government posts. And all but a few judges were removed from the bench to be replaced by Catholics, often regardless of character. Ireland had entered the period of history that is uppermost in the minds of the present generation. In March 1689 the deposed King James II of England, then a fugitive in France, mustered an army of French troops and landed in Ireland. The Protestants fled to Ulster, where, under the banner of William Prince of Orange and backed by England, they defeated the Catholic armies at the battles of the Boyne (1690) and Aughrim (1691). The victorious colonists were determined to keep Ireland Protestant and penal laws were introduced discriminating against Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After much disorder Ireland lost her parliament by joining it constitutionally to Britain in 1800. At that time a young Catholic lawyer twenty-six years of age, Danie) O’Connell, determined to rouse his countrymen. One might describe his strategy as the forerunner of the civil rights movement, because it was not so much the Catholic cause that turned O’Connell into the agitator as the act of the union of Great Britain and Ireland. His was a crusade of preaching up and down the country, urging his Catholic countrymen to stand up for their human rights. The Protestants looked to the union with Britain as the greatest protection for their rights and prosperity. Nevertheless, Daniel O’Connell succeeded to some extent, and in 1829 the Emancipation Act was passed, under which civil and religious liberty for Catholics was granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the turn of the present century great pressures were again building up. The Catholic population in the south was calling for separation from Britain and arming themselves to show their determination to get it. In the north of the country a massive movement was formed to keep the links with Britain by any means. The war slogan was raised “Ulster will fight.” As an indication of how high feelings ran, some half a million Protestants signed a solemn covenant, some signing with their own blood, declaring their determination to remain with Britain. Thus came into being the slogans, “No Surrender” and “Not an Inch,” and a volunteer force of 100,000 men was raised. As Ireland stood on the brink of awful bloodshed World War I broke out in 1914,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">From 1914 On</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While the war went on, southern Ireland armed. The Easter Rebellion of 1916 took place but was crushed by Britain. The struggle continued, however, and by 1921 the list of killed and wounded had risen to 3,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A compromise was finally offered by Britain, namely, (1) a separate parliament for the south, and (2) a separate parliament for the north. Ultimately this arrangement was accepted by both north and south of Ireland. The dividing of Ireland into two parts has left many problems unsolved, as is obvious from the present bitterness and tension that exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With this background we can better appreciate the present troubles in Northern Ireland, and it is interesting to note what the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland is quoted as saying: “We acknowledge the existence of such, a distressing situation must mark a grievous failure on our part as a Christian Church and people.” What, then, of the present?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Present Situation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps one can appreciate why many Ulster Protestants look upon the civil rights movement as just another front to end partition and to unite Ireland as a Catholic country, especially since the majority of its members are Catholic. The grievances of the civil rights members are basically the following: The Catholic population claims that it is being discriminated against in the matter of housing and employment, and is demanding electoral reforms so that there will be “one man, one vote” in local elections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Commenting on the situation, the Vatican newspaper </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L’Osservatore Romano</span><span class="font1"> said that the clashes between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland were reminiscent of a fufi-blooded war of religion. It also said that Northern Ireland Catholies lived in conditions of inferiority that rendered them second- or third-class citizens. One Catholic is quoted as saying: “Young lads are simply driven out for lack of jobs and homes. They’re second-class citizens in their own land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The extreme elements on the other side of the fence are the militant Protestants, who are against any form of compromise with Rome. They are against any reform measures as recently introduced by the prime minister of Northern Ireland in an attempt to stabilize the situation. The leader of the militant Protestants, cleric Ian Paisley, declared: “I want to tell you I hate the system of priestcraft and Popery and am prepared to fight for my Protestant faith and heritage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even within the ruling government party itself there are certain members opposed to the prime minister in his attempts at reform. He has already embarked on a policy to end discrimination between religious sections of the community, to improve the housing situation and to alter the electoral system. The problem is that, while many feel that the prime minister is not moving fast enough, others feel that he is already moving far too fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With one-third of the population in Northern Ireland being Catholic and two-thirds being Protestant, why is there this fear on the part of the Protestants that their position may be in jeopardy? This would seem to be because at primary school age the Catholic proportion of Northern Ireland’s population is nearly half. This is due to the large families among the Catholics. Looking ahead, many believe that the Protestants will eventually be outvoted. For this reason the prime minister and his supporters want to improve community relations now so that the Catholic part of the community will have no reason to want to split with Britain and end the partition of Ireland, with all the bloodshed that this would result in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The General Election</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a result of the tremendous trouble that Northern Ireland has experienced in the past few months as religious prejudices erupted into violence, and to try to get a clear mandate for his reforms, the prime minister called a general election. One of his most bitter opponents was the leader of the militant Free Presbyterian church. In many newspapers he has been described as “the rebel-rousing cleric.” Showing the religious aspect to his opposition, he preached: “I call down the curse of God on the traitor, ‘Captain Terence O’Neil,* ” because he feels that Mr. O’Neil, the prime minister, has been surrendering Protestant rights and privileges. Both the leader of the militant Protestants and one of his chief supporters received jail sentences for their activities in opposing civil rights marchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Any who viewed the treatment meted out to the civil rights marchers as television cameras recorded the scenes of violence must have wondered where the fine principles of Christianity were. The cameras caught the spirit of hate when five thousand militant Protestants marched to a rally in Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland. Ugly incidents took place as Catholic faced Protestant across the police barriers. Under a headline “Role of Clergy in North Criticised” one newspaper commented: &quot;There is another border in Ireland: the border between Northern Protestant and Northern Catholic.” Obviously, the religious education of neither Protestants nor Catholics in Northern Ireland has cultivated a love of neighbor such as was taught by Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Northern Ireland will never be the same again. The sensation of the election was the near defeat of the prime minister by the leader of the militant Protestants, showing how deep the religious feelings go. In actual fact the general election did nothing to lessen the huge difficulties that face Northern Ireland. The prime minister failed to obtain an overwhelming mandate to pursue his reforms, and many people see a hardening on both sides. It seems that the civil rights marchers will go back onto the streets with all the dire consequences that that promises. One thing that the election did prove was that strong divisive forces are at work, not the least of which is the hatred and prejudice based on religious fears and bigotry that have plagued Ireland for so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All over the world law-defying people are on the march, and they are bypassing the normal channels of negotiation in their demands for rights. This development points to the complete collapse of law and order as more and more people, frustrated by the futility at the present system of things, rebel against it. In all of this can be seen the outworking of the Bible principle that “whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (Gal. 6:7) The only remedy for the ferment in Northern Ireland, and the ferment throughout the earth, is the remedy the Bible points to: the impending intervention in human affairs by God’s kingdom that will serve to “gather all things together again in the Christ.” —Eph. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">STRENGTHENED BY GOD TO SPEAK BOLDLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">esus Christ promised his followers that when they were faced with the need to speak before men of prominence they could be assured of Jehovah’s help through Jesus, Yes, he said, “I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your opposers together will not be able to resist or dispute.” (Luke 21:15) Recently an individual who was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses enjoyed the fulfillment of this promise. How? Let her tell how it happened:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“After studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses for a short while I began to attend their meetings. Impressed by the educational feature of them and the friendliness of the Witnesses, I decided to stop going to my church. I next stopped my father from paying my church dues. Since I wanted to make a clean break from this institution of Babylonish false worship, I wanted to get my name removed from the church membership roll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“One evening my family was having the pastor come for dinner and I explained my new stand. I told him that I wanted my name removed from the church membership roll. He asked why, and when I began to explain the Bible's truths he cut me off by telling me that I would have to appear before the entire church so that they could vote on it I thought this was rather strange, for they had not required this in other cases. At first I was fearful, but then I thought, why not? This would be a fine opportunity to praise Jehovah. I prayed to Jehovah for help, The day came and two others accompanied me to the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“First the pastor started making sarcastic remarks, but we stood our ground. After I mentioned that as followers of Christ we are to do as he did, I asked the minister if I could use his Bible to read a scripture. He told me that he did not have one. So I read it from the </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span><span class="font22"> The scripture was Luke 8:1, which tells of Jesus' going from city to city and village to village preaching the Kingdom good news. We shared other scriptures with the audience and the reasons for our convictions. It turned out to be a fine witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“After I was through, the head deacon stood up and praised us for having so much courage. He said that he wished more young people would have such courage to stand up for what they believe. Then he offered a motion that our names be removed from the membership roll and they voted on it. The vote was, Yes. We were overjoyed and could hardly wait to reach the exit to thank Jehovah.&quot;</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">have accompanied me to the procession of the Lord of Miracles. Every October we’ve followed behind the image together for as many blocks as the crush of people would allow us. And especially since you have dedicated Linda to this saint you should feel obligated at least to take her to his procession. I don’t understand why you simply won’t attend with me this year. It is as the priest says—this studying the Bible—it is dangerous for us. You are losing your faith, Luisa.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“To the contrary, Maria. I find that for the first time in my life I’m beginning to have real faith. All our lives we have expressed faith in God while at the same time believing him responsible for our sorrows, Do you remember that we believed my long illness was his will for me—perhaps for some sin I had committed? And later about little Juanito’s accident. We said that God took him away from you because he must have wanted him in heaven. No, Maria, God could not be the cause of our unhappiness. True faith has taught me that indeed it is God who will eliminate such things as sickness and death from our midst and bring us a Paradise again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“But, Luisa, we all believe in Paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What’s so different about that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Maria, I have learned that Paradise for us is not when you and I get to heaven, because the Bible shows we’ll not be going there, but we can enjoy a righteous new system of things on earth. And it will be brought about, not by a god of three persons in one, but by the one true God whose name is Jehovah.”—2 Pet. 3: 13; Luke 23:43.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font31" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>ffffMfffS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Household Changes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Ay, Luisa, you have truly strayed a long way! You no longer even believe in our sacred Trinity. You must come with me to the procession of his image that they are carrying through the streets today in his honor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“You might well wonder, Maria, why this image of him, then, does not have three heads! I not only believe that you cannot make an image to the Creator of the universe but also have removed all of such things from my house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“As if I hadn’t noticed! First you removed our Lord crucified on the cross from over your doorway. And now how it pains me to see that you have also removed your Sacred Heart of Jesus—that beautiful gilt-framed picture of him that your mother gave you for over your mantelpiece. I might have guessed what was happening to you when I noticed that you were no longer even wearing your pendant of Mother and Child. After all these years. I shall have to bring the priest here, Luisa, so that he may sprinkle holy water throughout the whole house so that it may again be blessed by the Virgin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“It’s true that it cost me many sleepless nights arriving at the decision to give up these things that I thought were so dear to me and to make all these changes in my life, Maria. But as I read more and more in the Bible what God’s very own will is, I realized that I had been keeping all these things because I was afraid— afraid of bad luck, or a curse, if I didn’t keep them. Instead of love of God, it was fear of not doing these things that made me do them. For what can a gilt-framed picture of a man hanging over my mantelpiece do to help me even if I have a red light burning under his heart day and night?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“You will need to confess to the priest to cover all this sin, Luisa. I’m afraid even to hope that you still have your rosary on which to do the penance he prescribes. You must ask the Virgin’s forgiveness for turning her and her son out of your life. Here, let me pin this medal of her on you for a start.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“No, Maria. Some time ago I learned how to approach God in prayer in the proper way through his Son. I have constantly been asking his forgiveness for having adulterated his true worship with such things as medals and stamps, pictures and crosses. Since the church itself admits to having borrowed the use of most of these things from the pagans, I wish to make it quite clear to God that I am not any longer leaning toward paganism. Jesus Christ says we should worship the Father in spirit and in truth, and I am learning now to do that through my Bible studies.”—John 4:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Changes from Man-Made Traditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Well, Luisa, let me at least take Carlitos and Linda with me this afternoon to the procession. After all, I am Linda’s godmother, having been present at her baptism and confirmation and all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Maria, I hope you won’t be offended at what I’m going to say, but since godmothers and godfathers are simply a traditional arrangement of the church and not one of the Bible, I do not consider you in that sense anymore. You are our dear friend, Maria, and we can help each other mutually, but my children’s religious interests I realize now are mine and my husband’s. As a matter of fact, we have already presented a letter to the Ministry of Education. We have requested permission under the freedom of religion provided for in the Constitution of Peru to remove our two children from the religious instruction classes conducted under the priests in school. As well, I have personally spoken to the school principal about the matter and, although she is certainly opposed to the idea, she now knows that Carlos and Linda must spend that hour doing work other than religious.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“I am appalled that you would make such a decision, Luisa. Why, Carlitos was due to take his first communion this year in school and with it the confession of his sins to the priest. And, as a matter of fact, he won’t even be able to earn his school year now if he doesn’t fulfill the religious course!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;That is what I had always understood, too, Maria, but happily I find it. is not so. The laws of this country make provision for children to earn their school year on scholastic merits rather than on religious merits. And as far as communion is concerned, Maria, I myself have not taken it for some time now, since I have come to understand that it is not a requirement of God for all persons. Actually, his arrangement according to the Bible is quite different from the religious ritual we have always known. Even the mass itself was not conducted by early Christians, and I choose to follow their example rather than a tradition brought in centuries later.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Well, I must go now or I will be late for the procession. I see that you haven’t even dressed Linda in her purple dress this October in spite of the fact that you have dedicated her to the Lord of Miracles and this is his special month of devotion,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With that Maria takes her leave, crosses herself as she steps into the street, and her purple image fades into the distance. She leaves Luisa reflecting on how happy she is that she no longer depends on making the sign of the cross or dressing in a certain-colored garment in order to communicate with God for his help in keeping free from harm. “My prayers to him now carry all my earnest petitions in that behalf,’’ she thinks as she prepares for her weekly Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Changes That Bring More Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Marina, before you begin our Bible study, I just have to tell you this. Do you know what day this is?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“No, Luisa, I can’t think of anything special.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;It's Linda’s birthday. But instead of our having the customary big birthday celebration, we’re treating this day as any other day in the year, which, in fact, it is. I no longer want to be classed with the pagans who made a big thing out of celebrating the day of one’s birth.”—Gen. 40: 20; Matt. 14:6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“How wonderful that you’ve passed one more milestone on the road to true worship, Luisa. And what does little Linda think of all this?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Oh, I heard her happily explaining to her grandmother that nowhere in the Bible does it say that Christians celebrated birthdays. She also understands that there are no actual birth dates of Christians even recorded in the Bible, not even Christ’s. I’m afraid, though, that Linda’s little friends and cousins are finding it hard to understand, having expected a big birthday party. She has been busily explaining it all to them in her own little way, proud of her new Bible her daddy bought her some time ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“An additional point of interest on birthdays, Luisa, is that even the Jews of centuries ago regarded birthday celebrations as being part of idolatrous worship. When one analyzes it, the religions today honor so many different persons and things that it's unbelievable. Though they don't ah realize it, they are worshiping the sun, pagan love goddesses, present-day personages and long-dead ones that have been sainted—even ancient pagan kings such as-Nimrod. All these receive honor that we really owe only to the true God Jehovah. The worship of all these things is disguised by different names, but the dates and customs attached to them are as pagan as can be. Aren’t you glad to be freed from all that pagan tradition, Luisa?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Why, I should say it is a relief! Starting with last December 25 you have no idea how many of these creature-honoring days you mentioned we </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">have cut out of </span><span class="font1">our lives. Almost every month we were honoring a different man-made saint. Even my children now, Marina, understand that the only celebration left by Christ for his followers was the day of his own death, something that had an important significance for mankind.”—1 Cor. 11: 23-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“What a long way you’ve come, Luisa. What with Christmas, New Year, parent days, birthdays, saint days and other days honoring the living and the dead cut out of your lives, think of all the time you can channel into honoring the true God. But </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">how do you really feel</span><span class="font1"> about all these changes in your life, Luisa?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Happy Benefits from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Making the Changes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Listen carefully to what I’m going to tell you, Marina, and judge for yourself just what it means to me. Instead of saying the rosary and kneeling in prayer before pictures, images and crosses, I now pray directly to Jehovah God through Christ Jesus wherever I happen to be. I depend on personal study of the Bible to direct my thoughts on what to pray for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Instead of taking communion and attending mass, which repeated the same meaningless words to me for years of my life, I now attend and participate in three Bible meetings a week, even preparing six-minute sermons that help me in my relations with others and in fulfillment of true neighbor love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;Instead of the processions in which I mingled with masses of people, many of whom were dubious Christians, I now attend assemblies of Jehovah's people three times a year and enjoy days of pleasant, joyful companionship with people who truly live up to Christian requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;And instead of keeping a never-ending list of religious fiesta days accompanied by a host of God-dishonoring practices, I am now going to use my time participating in preaching God’s Word to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Finally, instead of spending my time playing bingo and preparing for endless church bazaars, I’m concentrating on being a better wife, keeping my home cleaner, and doing what I can to keep my husband and children happy. Talk about changes, Marina, I’ve made them. And does it sound to you like I’m happy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“It certainly does, Luisa. And talking about changes, you’ve truly put on a 'new personality,<sup>1</sup> acceptable to Jehovah God, with the prospect of living forever along with tens of thousands of other persons who have made the same happy changes.” —Col. 3:9, 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">D</span><span class="font22">HE apostle Paul wrote at Hebrews 13:18 that “we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” Paul lived up to these words, for he sought to make honest provision not only in the sight of God but in the sight of all men. (2 Cor. 8:21) Can individuals today follow Paul's example despite the moral breakdown rampant in the earth? The following experience from Arkansas, United States, answers this question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&quot;I was conducting a study of the Bible with a family. To help them progress, I saw the need of trying to interest the man of the family. I arranged to call on him with my husband. We encouraged him to bring his family to meetings of the Christian congregation, but his main objection was that he could never be a witness of Jehovah and stay in the business he had. He had a small shop where he worked on car bodies. All his competitors cheated the insurance companies, and he did too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">“Eventually he did bring his family to some of the meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, and each time, he heard about the need for Christians to be honest in all things. Not long afterward, he sold his business and had to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&quot;One day I received a letter from his wife thanking us for the help we had given them. She related that her husband’s honesty was really put to the test. He was employed in a car body shop, and his employer told him to go and steal a car part from another lot. His employer explained that it would not hurt the other man because his insurance would cover it. However, her husband took a Christian stand and refused to be dishonest. He told his employer that he would not steal for himself, and he certainly would not steal for another. He was fired for this godly attitude. Now he has a large shop of his own where he employs several Witnesses, and he has found that he can own a business and be honest.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">We live on the coral island of Barbados in the West Indies, the origin of which is traced back to the labors of the tiny coral animal. Yes, more than a quarter of a million persons live on this small island, only twenty-one miles long and eleven miles wide, built largely by living coral animals of the sea. How would you like to explore our unique island and examine the coral formations with us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although originally the island was built by living coral, the coral formations now seen are the bleached skeletons of creatures long dead. These creatures engineered the fascinating shapes and designs that form the patterns on the surface of the rocks on which we walk. Notice that some are formed like the ridges of a brain, others like round cogwheels meshed together; still others look like stacks of small hollow pipes. Just watch and you will discover an endless variety of coral patterns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You might wonder how we can grow anything on an island composed principally of skeletons of dead animals. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Well,</span><span class="font1"> the gradual disintegration of the skeletons by the action of water and weather has helped. This has produced a red-clay soil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">-the Skeletons of Master Architects</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font32" style="font-weight:bold;">By ‘'Awake!” correspondent in Barbados</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Also produced largely from coral is the abundant coral stone found on Barbados. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It is an attractive,</span><span class="font1"> creamy white, and is used in the building of stately coral-stone homes. The stone is easy to cut, but once it is exposed to the air it gets very hard and serves as a most durable and aristocratic building material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The delicately beautiful works of coral art have been prized for millenniums. An ancient king of 3,000 years ago emphasized the value of wisdom and discernment by saying; “It is more precious than corals, and all other delights of yours cannot be made equal to it.” Similarly, to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">impress the great value </span><span class="font1">of a good wife, an ancient writer said: “A capable wife who can find? Her value is far more than that of corals.”—Prov. 3:15; 31:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Architects of the Sea</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The idea that coral could build an island may seem incomprehensible. But what amazing architects these creatures are! An example of their prodigious work is the world’s most stupendous coral reef, extending 1,260 miles along the northeastern coast of Australia, and very aptly known as the Great Barrier Reef, in some places </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">it leaches down 8,000 feet into the sea, </span><span class="font1">and it encloses a watery area of around 80,000 square miles! Man has never raised an edifice to compare with this in size and magnitude! Yet these little sea animals have methodically worked away at raising this monument of architecture unequaled by any of man’s building achievements. How do they do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Well, the skeletons that make up the building material of these beautiful yet mammoth structures are formed by what are called coral polyps, minute living sea animals of the jellyfish family. After a very brief free-swimming, larval stage, these diminutive creatures settle down to a completely sedentary life, attaching themselves firmly on the skeletons of other coral animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Once rigidly settled, they grow into a small fleshy tube. At the upper end is the mouth, bearded with stinging tentacles, which reach out and capture planktonic animals for food by paralyzing them. At the same time, these little creatures begin secreting lime, quickly building around themselves a hard, cuplike formation into which they retract for protection. This forms the coral house or skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now these tiny coral animals, permanently settled for life, propagate and multiply. During the breeding season they begin to develop eggs and spermatazoa within themselves. Then the sperm of one polyp are released through the mouth opening and carried by water currents until they reach another polyp. Here they are drawn into the mouth by the waiting tentacles in the same way that food is sucked in, and fertilization of the eggs within that polyp takes place! Soon the next generation is set free through the mouth of the parent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At first the free-swimming larva is only about the size of a pinhead. But after settling on the coral skeletons of previous generations it may grow in size from an inch to more than a foot in diameter. In time the feeding heads on the upper and outer surface thrive while those underneath slowly smother and die, leaving their empty skeletons as foundations for future colonies to build on. Thus billions of tons of coral of diversified shapes and designs are formed to build up islands, reefs and atolls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Coral Garden</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Up until the last century these clever architects of the sea kept their identity a close secret. Prior to that time they were thought to be sea plants. This is understandable because at night when the coral feed they burst into bloom, as it were. The feeding tentacles reach out for food and appear to blossom forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What a magnificent sight it is! Purple with yellow trimmings, pink, blue, violet, orange and touches of gold mingled with rich jade and velvet black and rich scarlet, form a blaze of color and beauty. The floral tableau gives the appearance of manifold varieties of frozen flowers, some like branching trees, spires, pipes and fronds. Still others form tiers and layers, and delicate branching shapes like antlers or fingers; some hang like draperies in folds. Little wonder it was thought to be a floral garden of the sea!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As you dwell on the marvel of living coral and the wisdom it reflects, perhaps your reaction, too, will be that of the Bible psalmist: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made.”—Ps. 104:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HOT OR COLD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">• Are your summers “too hot,&quot; or your winters “too cold”? The surface temperature on the planet Pluto is estimated to be -380° F. (80° F. above absolute zero). And, while the exact surface temperature of Mercury is in question, it may be as hot as 800&quot; F. Be glad you live where you do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">L</span><span class="font1">AWLESSNESS is Widespread in the world today, but those who truly live in harmony with the Bible do not contribute to it. They take to heart the counsel of God’s Word, which says; “Be obedient to governments and authorities as rulers.’’—Titus 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is true that some who now practice true worship previously did engage in lawless conduct. They may have stolen things that belonged to others. Perhaps they viewed obedience to certain laws as important only when the police were in sight. In this they were probably no worse than many others in the community. However, the Bible made clear to them that, if they were going to take up true worship, they would need a very different outlook on life.—Eph. 4:22-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Subjection to Political Governments</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Commenting on the attitude that a Christian should have toward the political governments, the apostle Paul said: “Let every soul be in subjection to the superior authorities, for there is no authority except by God.” (Rom. 13:1) This does not mean that God established these governments or that he approves of their course. Some of them plainly say that they are atheistic. Nonetheless, God permits them to exist. They would not be able to exercise authority at all if God did not allow it. Jesus Christ showed this when he told the Roman governor Pontius Pilate: “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above.”—John 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So if God permits worldly governments to rule for a time, why should any Christian interfere with their doing so? Even if a person disagrees with what the government is doing, why should he join in a riot or share in civil disobedience to try to prevent the State frpm carrying on its business? Anyone doing so will get himself into trouble, not only with the secular government, but also with God. As Romans 13:2 says: “Therefore he who opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God; those who have taken a stand against it will receive judgment to themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is a good thing to show proper respect for the government and appreciation for the beneficial services that it performs. We all have good reason to be glad that the governments under which we live provide roads for travel, schools for education, fire protection and food inspection. Courts of law and protection against crime are also of great value. In these and other matters the “superior authorities” show themselves to be “God’s public servants,” providing services that benefit his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore when we are asked to pay for all these public services by means of taxes, we do well to call to mind the scripture that says: “There is therefore compelling reason for you people to be in subjection, not only on account of that wrath [in punishment of law violators] but also on account of your conscience. For that is why you are also paying taxes; for they are God’s public servants constantly serving this very purpose. Render to all their dues, to him who calls for the tax, the tax; to him who calls for the tribute, the tribute.&quot;—Rom. 13:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But how far does this subjection to political authorities go? Is it unlimited? Is obedience to human law even more important than obedience to the law of God? Certainly not! Notice that in the scripture just quoted the “compelling reason&quot; for obedience is said to include &quot;your conscience.&quot; So, one’s conscience is not to be ignored, especially if that conscience has been trained by the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus Christ showed that there are two aspects to consider. Pointing out that it was proper to pay tax to the Roman State, he said, “Pay back Caesar's things to Caesar,” and then he added: “But God’s things to God.” (Mark 12:17) So it is vital for each one of us to examine his course of life to be certain that, above all, he is not contributing to the widespread disregard for the law of God.—Ps. 1:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Obedience to the Supreme Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not long after the death of Jesus Christ, his apostles were called on to show where they stood on this matter. They were ordered by the rulers in Jerusalem to stop preaching in the name of Jesus Christ. Did they comply? Would you have done so? The apostles firmly replied: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (Acts 5:29; see also 4:18-20.) They did not treat lightly their obligations before the law of the land, but when a direct conflict arose between man’s law and the law of God, they recognized that God’s law is supreme. Seeing this, a respected member of the court before which they appeared wisely counseled his fellow judges not to interfere with these Christians, so that they as officials would not become fighters against God.—Acts 5:33-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not only God’s commandments about preaching that are important. There are other matters too. Highlighting one of them, Jehovah said to his people in the days of Moses: “You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion.” —Ex. 20:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Despite God’s laws to the contrary, many objects of devotion have been made by men. Some of them have been made of metal or wood. Others have been made of cloth, with a form representing some object in heaven or on earth sewed or painted on them. In some cases the acts of devotion performed before these have been voluntary, but in other cases they have been required by secular law. Does this make a difference? If the secular law requires certain acts of devotion to be performed before an image or emblem, does this relieve individuals of the obligation to obey God’s law on the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Faithful worshipers of Jehovah in the district of Babylon did not believe so. The Bible tells us that three young Hebrews, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, refused to participate in a ceremony ordered by the king. Why? Because it involved worship, and their worship belonged only to Jehovah. God approved of what they did. But how did the king of Babylon react?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">King Nebuchadnezzar at first was violently angry. Yet, in time, he saw the hand of Jehovah God in the matter. Realizing that they were no danger to the State, he issued a decree protecting their freedom (Dan. 3:1-30) Do you not admire their loyalty to God? Do you not want to be just as flrm as they were in giving worship exclusively to God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This same issue of worship confronted Christians living in the Roman Empire. The State required that everyone bum incense to the emperor as an evidence of loyalty. This the Christians could not do, although they obeyed the other laws. They realized that worship was involved, whether the act was performed in honor of an emblem or of a person. Jesus’ words applied: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—Matt. 4;10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Justin Martyr, who lived in the second century, expressed the views of these Christians, saying: “God alone we render worship, but in other things we gladly serve you [the political rulers], acknowledging you as kings and rulers of men.” These Christians were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">often misunderstood,</span><span class="font1"> but what they did really showed no disrespect, did it? Nor did it make them a danger to other Romans. These early Christians were really fine people. As the Roman governor Pliny the Younger reported in a letter to Emperor Trajan, they refused to commit fraud or theft or adultery. They were the kind of people that anyone would like to have as neighbors, and it was their religion that made them that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to our worship, there is something else that we owe to God. An apostle of Jesus Christ pointed to this when he said: “The God that made the world and all the things in it . . . gives to all persons life.” (Acts 17:24, 25) None of us would be alive if it were not for God. He is the Source of life. (p<sub>s</sub>. 36:9) But what are we doing with the life that he permits us to enjoy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proper Use of Our Lives</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True Christians recognize that, to enjoy God’s approval, they must avoid using their lives in activities that will put them in opposition to God. So they avoid the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">course of those classes of persons whom </span><span class="font1">the Bible describes as being in line for destruction by God’s executioner when this wicked system ends. (Rev. 19:17-21) They appreciate that Jehovah’s judgment is true and righteous. And they mold their lives now in harmony with his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True Christians are well aware that this may bring upon them disapproval, even persecution, from those whose only interests lie in this present system of things. But, with full faith that God’s way is right, they exalt his law and his worship, giving these first place in their lives. (Mie. 4: 1-3) In imitation of God’s own Son, Jesus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Christ, they use their lives, not for selfish </span><span class="font1">pursuits nor for the will of selfish men, but in harmony with the will of God. (1 Cor. 7:23; 1 Pet. 4:1, 2) So doing, they truly pay back to God what belongs to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do you want to have God’s approval? If </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">so, obedience to law will</span><span class="font1"> be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a serious </span><span class="font1">matter in your life. It will move you to have due regard for the person and property of your neighbors. It will make you respectful toward government officials. But, above all, it will cause you to bring your life into full harmony with the judicial decisions of Jehovah God, the greatest Lawgiver and the Supreme Judge of all.—Isa. 33:22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">More Campus Violence</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Harvard, oldest of America's renowned universities, was hit by a wave of protest and violence. On April 9 students seized the administration building and ousted several deans. The next day more than 400 helmeted state and local policemen swarmed onto the campus. There was a brief battle, some 200 persons were arrested and about 30 were injured. Stanford University was also hit, and so were Temple University in Philadelphia; Rutgers—The State University of New Jersey; Colorado State and Boston University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Church Influence Down</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">$ A Gallup poll asked, as it has through the years, whether religion as a whole is losing its influence. When taken in 1957, 14 percent replied “yes.” In 1962, 31 percent said so. Now 45 percent feel that religion is losing its influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Car Thefts</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Last year 815,000 motor vehicles were stolen in the United States. That is almost one out of every 100 registered in the nation. 1968 was 23 percent worse than the year before, which was 17 percent worse than the year before that, which was 10 percent worse than the year before that. The thefts represent an economic loss of more than $250,000,000. Eighty percent of the stolen cars were unlocked, almost half with keys left in them. Ninety percent of the car-theft arrests are of people under 25 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Head Suicide List</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The Auckland Star reported recently that “three times more doctors commit suicide than any other section of the population—and psychiatrists have the highest rate of all.” Studies showed that 70 to 85 percent of people who attempted or committed suicide did so while under medical care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Political Change Demanded</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Italy’s worst outbreak of labor strife in years took place in Battipaglia, in southern Italy, on April 10. In the rioting two onlookers were killed and 140 persons, 102 of them policemen, were injured. The people were demanding jobs and better working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">The Clergyman’s Image</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; The Scottish </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express </span><span class="font22">stated that “clergymen are distrusted even by some religious people. Only a minority are prepared to admit that a clergyman is a source of comfort in times of trouble.&quot; This was one of the astonishing conclusions reached by a national investigation carried out by the Independent Television Authority. The survey also found that there exists &quot;a strong resistance to church services on TV” and that television sermons are not popular. Ministers want to know why their public image is so poor. The paper replied; “I think [television itself] must take part of the blame. When last did you see a minister in a play on either BBC or ITV who wasn’t (a) a hand-wringing, chinless nitwit, (b) a mental case, shrieking hell-fire in dark corners, (c) a well-fed, pompous bore, toadying to the rich and powerful? . . . Why, therefore, are its ministers </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font22"> bad? Or, if not actively bad, at least sycophantic, time-serving moral weaklings?” Perhaps it is because the shoe fits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Eye Thefts</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Dr. Diego Cuevas Cancino, 46, owner of a private eye clinic, and a number of others were arrested for eye thefts. Why? A 13-year-old girl died of a gunshot wound. Within two hours the father noticed that the girl’s eyes were sewn shut. An investigation showed that the girl’s eyes had been removed. It is believed that over an eight-month period eyes had been removed from 60 bodies without permission of the next of kin. A cornea transplant brings about $2,000 in Mexico City where the thefts took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Smoking and Pregnancy</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Smoking during pregnancy can harm unborn babies, researchers at Columbia University have concluded. Two years of laboratory tests with pregnant rhesus monkeys have shown that nicotine introduced into the bloodstream of the mother impairs the heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen supply and acid balance of the unborn infants. Consequently, the babies of mothers who smoke may be smaller, lighter and less healthy than infants of nonsmoking mothers, accord-</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; A typical model of color television in the Soviet Union that sold at $1,320 has now been reduced to $1,003, The average Russian earns about $1,320 a year. On the other hand, his medical care is free, his rent very low, as are transportation and vacation costs. And the cost of staple foods is also low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Doubtful Young Clergy</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;^&gt; &quot;Most Queensland churches are worried by a drop in the number of men offering for the ministry,” said Douglas Rose, </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail</span><span class="font22"> writer. Commenting further, he said: “Within the ministry itself, there are signs of doubt among many younger clergy as to whether the ministry really is the best way to preach Christianity in the modern Australian Society. There are continuing drop-outs from the theological colleges because of this. It has happened before, but not on the same scale as in the last five years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Blasts Vatican &quot;Hypocrisy”</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Professor Harvey Cox of the Harvard University Divinity School told some 4,000 prelates, priests, students and scholars from more than nine countries that the Roman Catholic Church is helping foster unbelief. Cox said: &quot;Perhaps the major reason for unbelief in our times is not that people find the Gospel incredible but that they find the Church incredible.” He also stated: &quot;A Church that is not able to take a firm stand against war ... a Church that preaches poverty but continues to accumulate real estate is not a Church which deserves to be believed.” Cox went on to say: &quot;A friend who heard I was going to Rome said the best secretariat they could establish would be a secretariat for hypocrisy since hypocrisy —not unbelief—is the major religious problem of our time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Disasters Strike</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&amp; More than 40 small earthquakes rocked the Gulf of California on March 21. Two earthquakes struck the Dana-kil depression of northeastern Ethiopia on March 29; twenty persons were killed and more than 150 were injured. An earthquake of medium intensity shook the populated eastern region of Egypt on March 31, injuring several persons and damaging buildings. Israel also felt the tremors of a major earthquake whose epicenter was reported to be more than 300 miles south in the Red Sea. An earthquake struck the eastern slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, cracking walls in buildings. An earthquake struck western Turkey, killing at least 53 persons and injuring another 350. Such events are what the Bible foretold would mark the last days of this wicked system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Priests “Crucify” Church</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; Pope Paul VI of the Roman Catholic Church on April </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">2 </span><span class="font22">lashed out against rebelling priests. He said the Catholic church is suffering from a “restless, critical, unruly and demolishing rebellion” of priests and laymen. He asserted the rebellion is against the church’s canon law, its tradition, its authority, even its institutional existence. He also assailed prelates who have quit the church and said their &quot;scandal” crucified the church. The church suffers above all, he said, &quot;from the defection and the scandal of certain priests and religious laymen who today crucify the church.” This speech of the pope was described as his strongest declaration against the rising wave of opposition to church authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Children Take Drugs</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Some 25 children took drugs during morning classes at Heinz Kaiser Intermediate School, Costa Mesa, California. At least six of them were arrested, two were 15 years old, three 13 years old and one 12 years old. One was a girl. One parent said that his son had been unconscious for 61 hours and was still experiencing Impaired vision from the drugs taken. Parents, inform your children about the dangers of drugs in the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Mormons About Negroes</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; David McKay, 94, president of the Mormon Church, has stood firm On the church’s traditional doctrine about Negroes—that they are bom with black skins because of divine displeasure with their conduct in life before birth. That is why Negroes are barred from the Mormon priesthood, which is otherwise open to all males.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Plotting Revolution</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; Bishop David Placo of Santos, Brazil, and eight Roman Catholic priests and two deacons have been arrested. The government asserted that there is revolutionary activity being plotted by Catholic priests and laymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Man-Made Heart Used</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">An artificial heart was implanted into a patient by Dr. Denton A. Cooley of Houston, Texas. The heart was used for the first time as a temporary replacement for a human heart until a donor could be located. For two days 47-year-old Haskell Karp of Skokie, Illinois, lived with the artificial heart. Then a human heart was transplanted into the patient. Soon thereafter the patient died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Argentine Revolt Spreads</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; Young Roman Catholic priests are threatening the Catholic hierarchy with mass resignations if the Church does not become more sensitive to the needs of the people, A group of 251 priests from 20 cities in the northern dioceses issued a statement criticizing what was termed the insensitivity of church leaders to social problems. The statement came three weeks after 30 priests resigned their posts in Rosario, the nation’s second-largest city. There are about 5,500 priests in Argentina,</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Future Priests Would Marry</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">A study of Roman Catholic seminaries revealed that half of those training for the priesthood oppose mandatory celibacy and that 40 percent of them would “definitely&quot; or &quot;probably” marry if free to do so. A Gallup poll recently reported that four Catholics in ten believe that priests should be allowed to marry. This highlights the great dissatisfaction within the Church on its teaching on celibacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Flu and Mental Illness</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; Diseases such as Asian flu, mumps and measles can in some cases cause schizophrenia, say doctors. Dr. John Lovett-Doust, at the University of Toronto, said the Asian flu outbreak of several years ago resulted in a number of cases of schizophrenia. He also said medical histories of many schizophrenics show that they were “never the same person agpin” after a childhood bout of mumps or measles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">A fllying Institution'</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;$&gt; The former Episcopal Bishop of California James A. Pike said that he had lost hope that his church was capable of reforming Itself to meet the religious needs of modern men. He described it as a “sick-even dying—institution.&quot; “The poor may inherit the earth,&quot; he said, “but it would appear that the rich—or at least the rigid, respectable and safe— wfll inherit the church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Impotence of Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">The scars of riots and violence of several years ago have not been corrected in the United States. “The neighborhoods of our cities torn by the disturbances of last spring and before still bear the marks of violence and destruction,&quot; said President Richard Nixon. “Little rehabilitation or reconstruction has taken place.” “Months, and in some cases years, have passed—months of planning, argument and frustration—but the wreckage of the riots remains: fire-scarred, boarded-up buildings, vacant retail stores and rubble-strewn vacant lots.&quot; This, he said, shows the &quot;impotence of modern government at all levels.” “No wonder our citizens are beginning to question government’s ability to perform,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">These and other expressions acknowledged the unusual, if not unique, book</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The theme of the book and its significance to you are found in the publishers’ foreword:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“IN almost all countries throughout the world the doctrine of evolution is taught. School textbooks on biology and history present evolution as established fact. Evolutionary teaching saturates science, philosophy, history and even religion today. Whenever the subject of the origin of life and man is discussed, it is almost always presented in evolutionary terms. But what do you personally know of the evidence for or against the belief in evolution? Does it really harmonize with the facts of science? We invite your careful examination of this matter, as it has a direct bearing on your life and your future.”</span></p>
