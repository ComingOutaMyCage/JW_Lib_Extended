<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Kansas Industrial Relations Court</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">D</span><span class="font6">URING the coal strike of last winter the people of Kansas were without coal in zero weather; and in desperation Governor Allen called the legislature in special session, January fifth, to deal with the emergency. At that time the citizens in some parts of the state were cutting down their shade trees for fuel, in order to keep the women and the children from freezing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the interim, while the legislation was in preparation, the mines of the state were manned for three weeks by volunteer workers who produced a quantity of much needed coal, albeit at an expense to the state estimated at two hundred dollars per ton for the supply produced. This is ‘ sufficient evidence that the working of mines by volunteers is not practical, and that some better way to keep the mines working should be devised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Kansas Legislature tackled the problem and, using New Zealand and Australian laws as . models, succeeded in a very brief time in bringing forth a law which is a novelty in America, in that it is the first law ever passed in this land compelling employes and employers to submit their differences to a tribunal for adjudication. The law was passed on January twenty-fifth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The industries covered by the law are tin* manufacture and preparation of food, the manufacture of clothing, the mining or production of fuel, the transportation of these commodities, and all public utilities, such as water, gas and electric plants. The Court may intervene in any industrial controversy, either on its own initiative, or that oT the employers or of the employes or of a Committee of ten citizens or of the attorney general of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Court can summon all interested parties before it and make such orders, pending investigation of the condition of the workers, as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ar </span><span class="font6">to the public interest. It has the power to settle and adjust all controversies affecting working and living conditions, hours of labor and wages. It grants the right of collective bargaining and the right to choose one’s own field of labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Court has the power to establish or to change working and living conditions, hours of labor, rules and practices, and a reasonable minimum wage or standard of wages. Striking is absolutely forbidden. Persons can quit work, individually but must not influence others to quit. Picketing is made unlawful. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any person violating any order of the Court ■ \ may be punished by $1,000 fine br one year in , the county jail: but officers of labor unions who call strikes are liable to $5,000 fine or two years ! in the penitentiary. Lock-outs are forbidden, J except by order of the Court. This provision | makes it the only law ever passed in America ; which requires the manager of an industry to • ; get permission from anybody before he can j close his plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>First Effects of the Law</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font6">ITH tin* power of the state behind it, the first effect of the law, was, of course, to put the mines into full operation and to increase the production of coal. It is claimed that seven hundred men took advantage of the law and appeared before the Court to request an adjustment of grievances. A provision of the law does away with court fees, and without any expense a workman’s case may be appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, and is given priority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Court was able at once to correct an abuse, a species of thievery which had been practiced by the coal-mining companies and of which the men justly complained. If a miner wanted to draw half of his pay ahead of time the companies had been charging ten percent interest. The Court reduced this to fifteen cents in each case, thus correcting a great wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Governor Allen was naturally very enthusiastic about this law, and has been recommending it to legislative bodies and to commercial and manufacturing associations everywhere, including the Republican National Convention. He has boasted that the bill has teeth, and this is ■probably true. One of the questions at issue just now, however, is whether “teeth” and a gatling gun policy are better in the long run, or whether the old American idea of fair play and honest dealing is best, after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While it is true that many chambers of commerce, and “big business” in general, have stamped the Industrial Court with their approval, yet there are other men of ability and influence who have misgivings, and the law has been denounced by some economists, by the governors of some states and by some who are held in great esteem as statemen. Mr. Herbert Hoover, at one time world food administrator, has said of the- new Industrial Court that its summary actions “may both stifle a delicate adjustment of industrial processes and cause serious conflict over human rights”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On May 28, while elated with the first flush of victory, Governor Allen came on to New York in a special train and debated the value of his new law with Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor. The debate was held in Carnegie Hall. In the debate Governor Allen showed himself an able logician, and asked his capable antagonist three questions which have been widely published since the debate and which, at the moment, Mr. Gompers found it bard to answer. the questions were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1. When a dispute between capital and labor brings on a strike affecting the production or distribution of the necessaries of life. thus threatening the public peace and impairing the public health, has the public any rights in such a controversy, or is it a private war between capital and labor? 2. If you (Mi*. Gompers) answer this, question in the affirmative, how would you ''protect the rights of the public? 3. And. in addition, let him define for us, if he will, who had the divine right to forbid the switchmen to strike in their outlaw strike— who controls this divine right to quit work?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201110_files/g_E_19201110-5.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:17pt;">

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Who is the Public?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ovep.nor Allens questions, and the attempts to answer them with fairness to all, have thrown much light on the question of who and what the .public is, and what are its real and its fancied rights. Kansas has 14 percent of population made up of employers and 54 percent of employes, and the conclusion has been jumped at that the remaining 93 percent constitute </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">public that is really not a party at all to any controversy which may arise between miners and mine owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But a more critical examination of this question narrows us down to the fact that the public is made up of workers of some kind, and that if there are any of the public who do not work, and who are not interested in the living conditions of those who do work, then they may as well be eliminated from the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The wives, the children, the brothers, die sisters of workers, and their fellow workers and their families in other trades have a real interest in the living condition of miners, although it is true that educated as they are by employer owned newspapers (14 percent of the population) they sometimes give no thought to that subject until they are without coal in the midst of zero weather, and then, perhaps, the thoughts are only of anger that the miners should have as little regard for their comforts as they have shown for the miners' own comforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This presents a new aspect to the strike, or one generally not seen. No person can claim rights without acknowledge ng-responsibilities. If we claim the right to have coal we must acknowledge the responsibility to see to it.that the miner gets a fair deal. In every strike the workers who are not directly involved in the struggle, that is* to say the public, by whatever inconveniences they may have to suffer, are helping to bear their proper responsibility for failure to s^e that economic justice has been provided for other workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Gompers, with his long experience in such matters, saw this point: for in his public answer to Governor Allen, published after the debate, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The public has no rights which are superior to the toiler's right to live and to his right to defend himself against oppression. Every strike for the improvement in the condition and standards of those engaged in industry has its relies and influence for the uplift of all,”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201110_files/g_E_19201110-6.png" alt="" style="width:38pt;height:177pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19201110_files/g_E_19201110-7.png" alt="" style="width:33pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Did we ever think of that before? Did wo ever seriously reflect that we ought to as zealous in the cause of labor when it is underpaid as we are in our own behalf when a strike shuts off the necessities of life </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> Did we ever stop to think that workers do not bring on the sufferings which are incident to strikes, and in which they themselves suffer most of all, unless they are 'forced to do so by intolerable conditions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> These observations help us to see how the interests of all are bound.up together and that the gatling-gun method of adjusting difficulties of this nature can never succeed. No majority of the people can have rights which impose upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">minority of the people intolerable conditions. The claims of justice can not be righteously fulfilled as affecting the whole public if at the same time these claims are denied to any part of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">i Now coming to the Governor’s new law we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font6">see the necessity, if it is to be a success, that it must be administered by men of the highest character, men whose sense of justice is unusually keen, for these men are assumed to represent all the people in their efforts to see that justice is done to each and every one of its component parts—surely a large order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 One can see that whatever rights the people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font6">whole have to the enforced service of miners, or other workers, they have the same rights to the services of the highest-paid and most capable men in their midst, and the ability to compel an employer to continue to pay out money to workers once employed is as real as the ability to compel workers to continue working for certain employers. The Governor’s new law is a step toward socialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Objections to the Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">MMEDIATELY after the Kansas law was passed, the movement spread to other states, Illinois, Colorado. Wyoming, Nebraska, New York and Massachusetts: and there will evidently ^e an attempt to make such legislation general. ’’ But can we be certain that the temporary success of this Court is any augury that it will prove to be a permanent remedy ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Until now the whole peorde. sitting in the Court of public Opinion, have been passing upon matters of this nature, and if the newspapers would but do their duty and tt'll all the facts, and not suppress the facts favorable to the miners, our opinion is that this informal Court would still l&gt;e better for the settlement these issues than any formal Court that could J&gt;e appointed by a Governor. If there is to be such an Industrial Court then it should be elected by the people as a whole, and not appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The living conditions of the miners are not good. Their work is very irregular, as previously shown in The Golden Age, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">report of the President's Commission has </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shown </span><span class="font6">that foi* two years they have been working </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">a wage thirty percent below the level of bare subsistence. Wien the mines are working, which is a poor percentage of the total, time they should be working, they are overcrowded with men and have insufficient cars to enable these men to make a living wage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Offsetting the condition of the miners is the fact that in 1917 all the bituminous coal mines east of the Mississippi River made an average profit of 100% to 150% on the invested capital. This profit was less in 1918, but even these large profits were still enjoyed by about one-fifth of the total number of mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Industrial Court will be liable to establish precedents which will make it increasingly difficult for the workers to progress in the direction of better wages or greater control of. the industries by which they live. Indeed, some students believe that by the delays which </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font6">intervene before revisions of rewards may be obtained this law may be the means of bringing about the very unrest it is supposed to allay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Right to Strike</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201110_files/g_E_19201110-8.png" alt="" style="width:13pt;height:16pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">HE newspapers of the country are mostly owned by wealthy men, and the uniform impression they convey with reference to almost every strike is that the men who have quit work as a protest against their low pay or excessive hours of labor, or other unsatisfactory conditions, are a band of assassins, highwaymen that must be quickly cowed by the display of force. This is not true; and Mr. Gompers has truthfully said in this connection that ‘‘American workmen, through organization and protest, through the strike, have paid back to America in fitness for citizenship a thousandfold for the sufferings strikes have caused”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely the people as a whole do not approve of the employment of children in mines and in factories or of the sweatshop in which, in order to exist, whole families for a mere pittance work sixteen hours a day in the most unsanitary </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">conditions. It was </span><span class="font6">the strike that measurably put an end to such conditions as this in America, and it is to be feared that any Industrial Court would have accomplished the same results much more slowly and less thoroughly, if at all,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. It is true that strikes are a nuisance, and that the country has had thousands of them to try its patience, yet the American people would not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tolerate a </span><span class="font6">condition such as prevails in India, China or Japan, where the workmen must accept </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ what </span><span class="font6">is given them and where many are at all times on the edge of starvation. No one will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">deny </span><span class="font6">that one or two or more human beings striving for a right have more justice on their side than a million other human beings seeking </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to take </span><span class="font6">that right away. Moreover, history has shown that the strike has repeatedly been proven to- be a measure necessary to public progress, as long as the mainspring of business </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">selfishness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an address to striking shoe workers of Worcester? Massachusetts, President Lincoln said: ‘’Thank God, we live in a country where, at the last point, the workman may stop work”. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> says that President Wilson has also declared that the right to strike is inviolate. Attorney General Palmer, however, &gt;&nbsp;admits and denies the right in the same breath ' “by the following statement, issued October 29, ■. 1919. He said, “It does not follow that every i strike is lawful merely because the right to strike is recognized to exist. Every case must stand upon its own bottom and be governed by its own. facts.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>How about the Constitution?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">K</span><span class="font6">ANSAS had its birth in opposition to slavery, but now it is alleged by some of its foes to be the champion of that condition. The Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides, &quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted;- ^Jiall exist within the United States, or any place’subject to their jurisdiction”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The legal definition of &quot;involuntary servitude” is &quot;any control by which the personal service of a human being is disposed nf or coerced foi\ another's benefit”. The American Federation 4&gt;f tabor claims that the Kansas Industrial Court law violates this constitutional</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. right, and states that the Federation will never surrender its right to strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is tacitly admitted by all well-informed and honest people that, during the war, the United States Constitution was ignored and deliberately violated by the very officers who had promised Almighty God and the American people that they would uphold it to the letter, in peace and in war. Conditions developed that made the servants of the people, sometimes mistakenly called the authorities, feel that they were justified in overreaching and assuming prerogatives never entrusted to them by the people and therefore still rightly’ in the' people’s care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Miners and others were enjoined from striking or were notified that they must not strike, and the people were content to let the matter pass unchallenged; but now that the country is at peace the right to do these things </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> chal</span><span class="font6">lenged. The right to do these things implies the equal right to issue injunctions </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">against </span><span class="font6">employers, forbidding them to reduce wages or-to lock out employes, and compelling them to submit to the workers<sup>3</sup>&quot; demands. No such rights have ever been delegated by the people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Industrial Court did not start off </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">Kansas without a hitch. On its first visit </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">Pittsburg, the Kansas coal center, two thousand miners went out on strike as a protest against the presence of the Court in their midst, and remained out for a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The leader of the miners, Alex. Howat, refused to testify before the Industrial Court or to recognize it, on the ground that it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">unconstitutional court. After a week in jail </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">gave bond, pending an appeal to the Kansas Supreme Court. While he was locked up practically all of the coal miners of Kansas left their work. The Industrial Court took no steps to lock up the twelve thousand miners that thus held it in contempt, Init the incident raises the question whether it is a good thing to have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">Court in existence that functions in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Underwood, of Tulsa, Oklahoma (whether having this incident particularly in mind or not we do not know), has made the statement that in his judgment the time will rotne when the golden rule will be followed by all men, and when courts and lawyers will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">thing of the past. That is the kind of doctrine The Golden Age believes in, and it also believes in the men that do believe in that kind of doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">A Money-Mad World</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">F THE love of money is a </span><span class="font6">root of all kinds of evil, then the tree of evil must be growing more rapidly now than ever before, for its roots </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">surely spreading with lightning rapidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The actual money of the world is not so great. If all the currency of the world were divided </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">equally </span><span class="font6">it would give each person only about </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">forty </span><span class="font6">dollars. The greater part of what passes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">money is merely </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">printed acknowledgment </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">indebtedness. There is a great deal more of this kind of money afloat now than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the World War the average indebtedness, the world over, was about $26.67; now it is six times as great. If all the money in the world were divided equally, and all the debts in the world were divided equally, we would each </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">$140 in debt until we could sell some of our other property and turn it into money, in case we happened to have any to sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early the other morning a money-mad milkman passed the house. He was driving slowly, and was slowly pouring off a large part of the cream from the top of each milk bottle, thus making up little bottles of cream which he would </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sell, </span><span class="font6">later in the day, to the damage of his em</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ployer </span><span class="font6">and his employer’s customers, for. the benefit of his own private purse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An </span><span class="font6">illustration of the lengths to which people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font6">go when they are money-mad is afforded by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">circumstance which has been brought to our attention. There is a business in New York in which two hundred fifty men and women are employed. The business has been successful and within a year has accumulated a fund of $225,000 over and above dividends, interest and surplus. Two men, the general manager and his assistant, each in the business over ten years, and each receiving over $15,000 a year salary, came to the president, representing all the employees asked a share in this special fund, and finally requested that a committee of employes be named to run the business in the place of the president of the concern. Seemingly, every person in that business, from the president down, was money-mad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Money Control of Wages</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Anaconda Mining Company, of Butte, Montana, has the reputation of being one of the most cold-blooded combinations of wealth in the country. Living conditions in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Butte are </span><span class="font6">very bad. The air is so gas-laden that nothing green can live, and the prices for necessities are out of proportion to the wages, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">$5.75, paid </span><span class="font6">to the ore diggers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In April the miners went on a strike for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">better </span><span class="font6">wages and picketed the works, a thing in itself entirely lawful, whatever may be our views </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font6">garding its abuse. In two days from the time the picketing started, other employes of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">company, in the guise of deputy sheriffs, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">in the company of their employers, shot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font6">twenty of these pickets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was done while the sheriff and members of the city police force calmly looked on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and did </span><span class="font6">nothing. Unable to face such a combination of wealth and power many miners </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have left Butte, </span><span class="font6">and the company has. imported </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">men to take their </span><span class="font6">places, but has probably not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">gained </span><span class="font6">as much </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">it has lost, owing to the lesser </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">efficiency of the </span><span class="font6">new men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">ENTS in New York and vicinity have risen to heights that are almost incredible. We know of a man who was paying $75 per month rent; his landlord at one jump increased his rent to $225 per month—another $150 to $400.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conditions like this are possible only because there is a shortage of homes, and investigations have now disclosed a permanent arrangement in New Y'ork for maintaining such a shortage indefinitely. The buildings of New York are mainly of brick; nearly all the brick is made in yards located along the Hudson River; all of the manufacturers of brick in these yards sell their product through a dealers’ association; a builder who is not a member of that association cannot get any of that Brick, and no man can become a member of that association unless his competitors admit him to membership. In other words the building business of New York is in control of the men who control the dealers’ association. As a matter of fact, persons who are not members of the dealers* association can not get cement either; for The cement dealers dare not antagonize those who now hold </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">strings of power that control the building operations and thus the rents of the great city.

<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Control of Food Production</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">F</span><span class="font6">OR more than a generation the fanners of the West have been compelled to pay extortionate rates of interest for the money needed to put in their crops. Fifteen percent was not uncommon, and much more than this has been obtained by the familiar ruse of “shaving’ notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At length, after a long battle, the farmers succeeded in securing legislation bringing about the establishment of federal farm loan banks, to loan them money at 5 percent to 54 percent. But at once the victory was spoiled by a suit brought to test the constitutionality of the farm loan bank act, the bonds of the farm loan banks could not be sold, and as a result the farmers are now paying the same old interest as formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bankers of the Farm Mortgage Bankers’ Association have now come out with a formal statement to other banks whose cooperation they court, claiming all the credit for the operation by which the farmers have been deprived of the privilege of borrowing money at a reasonable rate of interest. No doubt these bankers would be the first in the land to urge other people to contribute their dollars or their sons to be used in the defense of American honor; but where is their own honor, when they know that the Government has urged the farmers to plant more crops and they stand directly across the path by which alone the farmers can provide more food for the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The bankers need to get at it and clean out the hypocrites that are in their midst. When the Executive Council of the American Bankers’ Association met for their three-day session at Pinehurst. N. C.. in April, they discussed the need for more farm owners, longer leases for tenants and means for stopping the drift from the farm to the city. Moreover, they </span><span class="font5">listened </span><span class="font6">to a message from the Secretary of Agriculture to the effect that there is an increasing demand for food to feed the increasing population, and that this must be met by producing more food to the acre and by improved methods, as otherwise the cost of production will increase more and more. Bub how is the farmer to produce more and cheaper food, if he is deprived by the bankers of the use of capital, at reasonable figures, which every business requires if it is to live!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the meanest tricks that are played upon the workers is played by politicians who pretend to be interested in the lot of the workers, so as to take the leadership away from some man who is really interested in their welfare. They thus deceive the workers into hoping for better conditions, knowing all the time that they have no intention of aiding them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everybody knows why government management of the railroads was made </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be a </span><span class="font6">failure. It was a failure which was deliberately planned. The same men were permitted to operate the roads under government management who had everything to gain financially, ami nothing to lose except honor, if they could succeed in proving to the public that. government ownership is a failure. How well they accomplished their purpose you can readily learn by asking any railroad man to tell of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">instances that came under his own observation of how operating costs were deliberately multiplied, and the time of crews wasted, by the men who recently secured the advance in freight and passenger rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not true that transportation lines cannot lie operated successfully by the public, and it is not true that higher than five-cent fares are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">necessity for the proper operation of street-car lino? that were honestly built and financed. In San Francisco, which has public ownership of ■rreet-car lines, the passengers are carried for a iivo-rent fare, the same as formerly: the cars are clean, commodious and comfortable; and they pay a handsome profit to the city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Benevolence such as he did not show toward the Bible students that he sentenced to Atlanta, was manifested by Judge Howe toward Felix Gouled, a wealthy army raincoat contractor. This man was convicted October 18, 1918, of defrauding the government and was sentenced to seven years in the penitentiary and a fine of $10,000, but he was not locked up and denied bail, as in the case of the Bible students. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font6">the other hand he was released on $25,000 bail; and now, while his case is up before the Supreme Court, he is permitted to go to Europe for three months to undertake a large sale of ' cotton to the Polish Government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Transportation Benefits: 2?// z?. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J. Wilson</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Editor: In your April number, page 495, under the heading, “Finance—Commerce—Transportation,” I find the following: ‘ The proposition is under way in England, as in America, to raise the railroad rates so as to put the railroads on a paying basis. Those who use the railways, whether for travel or for merchandise, should pay for them.” I presume at least you endorse that sentiment or you would not give it a hearing in the columns of your publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There never was a greater economic errer promulgated than that the users of a public utility are the only ones benefited by such utility. The late James J. Hill recognized the fact that the presence of a railroad created land values second only to the presence of people upon such land; consequently, the holders of vacant land were benefited in a greater degree by such railroads than the people who used them. That being the fact (and no rational person will deny it), then the burden of upkeep and maintenance should be borne equally by all who are benefited by such utilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Without population land has no vahie, and without transportation you cannot have a prosperous community. So, to my mind, the speculator who holds vacant land out of use is of no value to the community and should ho taxed out of existence, the same as any other nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">James J. Hill uttered another vital truth when he said: “Land without labor is a wilderness, and labor without land is a mob”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At least $350,000,000 of value has heen created in vacant land in Seattle by the street-car system, and the holders of such land have never been called upon to pay one penny by taxation, to extend, maintain, and operate said system. Our City Councilmen are back numbers, and they abe^preparing to make the users of our street-cars pay all the expense that goes with the system, but they let the holders of vacant property, the operators of the great department stores, and the owners of the great office buildings in the business districts escape absolutely, nothwithstari^ling the fact that they are the greatest beneficiaries of the car svstem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to this, the rent hog has boosted rents beyond the power of endurance, and that increase also has been passed on to the ultimate consumers, so that the ordinary citizen is robbed of his birthright, and is unable to provide the necessaries to clothe, shelter, and nourish his wife and family properly. These questions are up for settlement and never will be settled until they are settled right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Please give this letter space, and thus help the people think along correct economic lines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Apostle James gave the wealthy men of his own times a rebuke in the following language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Hearken, my beloved brethren. Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats I Do not they blaspheme [misrepresent] that worthy name [Christian] by which ye are called?”—James 2:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shalhcome upon you. Your riches are corrupted. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton.”—Jas. 5:1-6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Norway’s Conciliation Courts</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font6">N 1797, by a royal edict, while Norway and Denmark were still under one sovereign, there was instituted what has proven to be the ■‘most beneficent law ever promulgated by a king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the use of the principle of conciliation procedure, an arrangement by which the parties to a suit meet a special tribunal in private, with or without attorneys, tell their stories, receive advice from’the judge as to their rights, and his advice as to what would be an equitable settlement. The plan met with immediate and permanent success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ Every village containing at least sixty fanii--iies constitutes a separate district of conciliation. The*districts are purposely made small so ■that all the parties may know one another. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font6">best men in the community are selected </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as the </span><span class="font6">peacemakers or judges of these causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ The </span><span class="font6">plaintiff states his case in writing. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">fee of twenty-five cents is charged for issuing <sup>;</sup> the’summo'ns. with fifty cents more if a conciliation is effected. No case can go to a regular court unless it is accompanied by a certificate that it has been before the conciliation court. As a general thing, lawyers are excluded. Parties who refuse to appear before the conciliation court must pay the costs when the case </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">goes </span><span class="font6">to the regular court, even if they win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Agreements of settlement are recorded and can be enforced the same as final judgment. Nothing that is stated in the conciliation court can l&gt;e used if the case goes into the regular court, except that if either of the parties was . willing to settle he receives a certificate to that effect. From seventy-five to ninety percent of the cases are-peaceably adjusted in these courts of conciliation. Any attempt to abolish them would bring about a revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one year, out of 101.669 cases submitted to this court, conciliation was effected in 81,015 » instances, and 7,866 more cases were success-fully^&amp;rbitrated in the same court, thus adjusting about nine-tenths of the cases amicably, quickly and cheaply, without loss of time or money and without severing old ties of friendship an$ go$d will.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>American Conciliation Courts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font6">N ATTEMPT was made in North Dakota, in .1893, to introduce the Norway and Denmark procedure, but the act permitted either of the parties to the conciliation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">send </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">another to </span><span class="font6">represent him at the hearings, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and made it </span><span class="font6">necessary that the hearings </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">held </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">before a </span><span class="font6">justice of the peace. These provisions </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">weakened </span><span class="font6">the effect of the act, and when it was subse* quently so modified as to require attorneys tn represent the parties before conciliators </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font6">be called in, it died an ignominious </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Cleveland, Ohio, in March, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1913, the ♦ </span><span class="font6">Municipal Court of Cleveland </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">opened a conciliation branch for causes involving not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">more than ’ </span><span class="font6">$35. Proceedings are private, defendants </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">always </span><span class="font6">appear in response to notices mailed, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">agree</span><span class="font6">ments are always reached and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">there are nd </span><span class="font6">appeals. The cost to litigants ranges from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">25 </span><span class="font6">cents to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">55 </span><span class="font6">cents. Formerly, 40,000 cases </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font6">brought annually before the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">justice courts of </span><span class="font6">Cleveland.

<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Informal Courts of Equity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">C</span><span class="font6">HICAGO has an informal court for the trying of claims amounting to less than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">$35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Contested cases are tried at an average of fifteen minutes each. During the first year </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font6">judge disposed of about 1,000 cases a month. The limit has been gradually raised to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">$200, </span><span class="font6">and a second, and then a third, judge </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">put </span><span class="font6">oa the calendar. During the first four months </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">1918 these judges disposed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of 6,863 cases. About </span><span class="font6">forty percent of all the causes which go to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">court </span><span class="font6">in Chicago are for claims of less than $200. What is saved the contestants may be judged from the fact that a jury trial in a cause involving $300 usually costs the parties .for witness and counsel $75 and the public a like amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. In the State of Washington there is now an attorneyless small claims court in which claims of $20 or less may be tried and final sentence obtained at once. Plaintiffs must pay $1.50 to enter suit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another step forward is that in several states the office of Public Defender has been created, to make sure that a poor man accused of crime is adequately defended. This is on the true theory that the State has no good interest in merely seeing a man convicted—an innocent man.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Conciliation Versus Litigation</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bb ah am Lincoln's</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> motto was</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.“Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often the realjoser, in fees, expenses and waste of time.” Compare these wise and kindly expressions of a great man with the bare fact that in some cities of the United States— notably Philadelphia, though it is doubtless true elsewhere — that there are men who make a living by watching hospitals and doctor’s offices and getting powers of attorney from persons who have been injured in accidents. These powers of attorney are subsequently auctioned off to lawyers who make a specialty of handling such cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Alex.‘Simpson, Jr., Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, is quoted in the Journal of the American Judicature Society as having said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘T happen to he president of the board of trustees of the Methodist Hospital in Philadelphia : and until that board by resolution forbade it them was not an accident case brought to that institution that there was not at least a dozen lawyers coining in to see the injured man and trying to get to represent him on a contingent fee. This is not an exaggeration; ir is an actual fact.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there are staunch defenders of right in the Bar Associations. In New York city recently a majority of the^Bar Association passed resolutions expressing the opinion that two of the judges before whom they practiced daily were unworthy of renomination. This had a'direct bearing upon the earning power of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font6">lawyers,, and required of them a considerable degree of courage and faithfulness to right for the sake of right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bolshevism: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Newton T. Harkhorn</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201110_files/g_E_19201110-13.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:16pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">VIDENTLY the meaning of the word Bolshevism, as applied in Russia, is government solely by the working class in the interest of the working class. Hence the underlying principle of Bolshevism is government by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">class in the interest of a class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years since, in London, in discussing American politics, one of the heads </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font6">greatest banking house in the world said </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">me: “You do not have popular government in the United States; the people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">do not rule; </span><span class="font6">money rules”. The New York agent of that banking house, who was also the agent of the British Government in the United States, was for fourteen years chairman of the national committee of one of the two great political parties which have elected the president of the United. States for fifty years past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Evidently the English baron afore mentioned was good'authority on the kind of government which we have in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now then, if, as before stated, Bolshevism is government by a class in the interest of a class, and if the English baron was correct in his analysis of our government, we have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">had Bol</span><span class="font6">shevistic government in the United States for these many years: the only difference between^ Russian Bolshevism and American Bolshevism being that in the United States it governs in the interest of the capitalistic or aristocratic class, while in Russia it governs in the interest of the working class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. Dr. Fisher, head of the Industrial Department of the Inter-Church World Movement, was sent to Russia by that organization to learn the facts in regard to the Bolshevist government. At the Atlantic City’ conference he reported that the Russian Bolshevist government was a sincere and successful effort by the working people of Russia to administrate the government in the interest of the working people, and that if he lived in Russia he would be a Bolshevist. I was at that Conference as the accredited representative of a leading American newspaper, and I heard (and secured a verbatim report of) Rev. Dr. Fisher’s speech. But the paper I represented refused to print the report, and it did not appear in any paper, as far as 1 could learn. Dr. Fisher stated that nothing but lies appeared in the American Dress about Russia: he also stated that Lenine was a’greater statesman than the British Premier, Lloyd George, or Clemenceau, or President Wilson. The celebrated aphorism of the last, &quot;Make the world safe for Democracy,&quot; seems to have been very generally translated into &quot;Make the world safe for Imperialism”. From such few direct reports as we have, truly Lenine seems to &quot;ne about the only one of the world’s prominent statesmen who is making a sincere effort to apph the famous slogan.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19201110_files/g_E_19201110-14.png" alt="" style="width:31pt;height:677pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Tn England ninety percent of the working people are organized in labor unions: and they notified the English Premier. Lloyd George, to quit meddling with Russia or take the consequences. And he quit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Inter-Church world move seems to have collapsed, and possibly one reason for the ™ collapse is that Dr. Fisher was telling the truth tn the American working men-too industriously to suit aristocratic Bolshevism. Dr.. Fisher, • however, is not the kind that lies down at the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">edge of the whip; and we may </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hear more from </span><span class="font6">him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American press with scarcely </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">exception (possibly the Hearst papers) is controlled by big capitalists who are in terror lest working-class Bolshevism shall get control; and their press goes into spasms at </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the bare </span><span class="font6">thought of Communism, as they call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Communism may destroy the vital spirit of industry, but if it can show worse results </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font6">have come from aristocratic class communism (rule by the few in the interest of the few) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the past few years, it must indeed be a dreadful system. But the fact is that the Soviet System is.not real communism. However,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-we need not </span><span class="font6">expect righteous government by either </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">working class, or the middle class, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or the </span><span class="font6">aristocratic class. All of them are bound </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to' </span><span class="font6">fail under the depraved conditions that obtain. The psychology of the times is peculiarly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">phe</span><span class="font6">nomenal; the old social, political, economic </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">religious world is in its death struggle, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">the birth of a new world of surpassing glory </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is about to take place—the kingdom of heaven— the Golden Age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Invention and Prophecy: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Frederick Lardent, DJF.O.A., London</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font6">NE reason why so many wonders in our midst are taken as matter of course, is the fact that invention and improvement have arisen by seemingly slow successive stages. But had they been more suddenly thrust upon the human race what an excitement would have been caused!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For instance, to change instantly as a means of transit from the horse or the camel into the long serpent-like train, which rushes and hisses over the surface of the land at fifty miles an hour, and within which are seen men quietly reading er sleeping, or surveying the quickly passing landscape, would have surely brought forth marked expressions of astonishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again to see men able to overcome the power of gravitation and to rise and soar like a bird high in the air and then quickly disappear in  the far distance—in other words to see them, as it were,/mount up with wings as eagles’’— would have been a marvellous sight in days gone by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again, to come to the edge of the glassy sea and to witness a few men disappear in a strange looking craft, which eventually glides beneath the waters like a fish; or to hear the voice of a relative or of a notable singer or the fuH r ; music of an orchestra proceeding from a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">box- । -</span><span class="font6">upon a table: or to see a man talk to his friend । who- is actually at a very great distance, by ’ simply speaking through a small funnel-like ; contrivance; or to touch a switch and find one's * vicinity illuminated by a powerful light; or to <sup>1 </sup>enter an immense vessel, equipped with many ‘ conveniences for human comfort and pleasure, and in a short time find one’s self upon another continent, the other side of the world—all these <sub>t</sub> 1 and many other such-like marvels would have <sub>s </sub>caused our friends of long ago to think they : were living in a land of endless enchantments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indeed, the fairy-fiction writers of the past . ' did not conceive of such wonders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But this is in fulfillment of prophecy; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the ' </span><span class="font6">&quot;shall'* of so many a prediction may now </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be ‘ </span><span class="font6">turned into the present tense — ‘knowledge <sub>{</sub> * has increased? ‘many </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font6"> running to and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fro? : </span><span class="font6">‘chariots </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font6"> raging in the streets? ‘they </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rfo </span><span class="font6">seem like torches' and ‘run like lightnings'. (Nahum 2:3. 4: Daniel 12:4) Also the “swift, <sup>1</sup> ; beasts” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Isaiah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">66:20 — literal, 'swaying ; </span><span class="font6">furnace’ as of a train in rapid motion—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font6"> now rushing toward Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, we are witnesses to the foretold ‘'time of trouble&quot; upon the nations, and the increasing prosperity of the Jews and their return to the land of their forefathers. (Romans 11:25) These prophecies in their fulfillment point to the fact that we are on the eve of an entirely new dispensation. Thinking men realize, too, that the present-day marvels are but in their infancy. Forogleams of greater wonders are still reaching the ears of the public, and we may rest assured that, when these discoveries and inventions are all utilized for the general welfare and happiness of mankind, the coming age will be superior in every way to any which has been witnessed in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What, then, if this new age be ushered in by the roar of thunder? What though mankind be afflicted by foreboding fears ? What though the many idols be heaved up and dashed to a thousand fragments upon the ground beneath? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If day</span><span class="font6"> is breaking—the sunlight of which will illuminate and bless the groaning millions— </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font6"> with a clarion voice ringing throng!) earth and sky let us say—let it Come !</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True are the words of the poet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an age on ages telling, To be living is sublime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Hark! the rumbling in the nations, Iron crumbling with the clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hark! what*soundeth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6"> 'Tis creation Groaning for a better day!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now there is one of these foregleanis before the notice of the writer: A London newspaper speaks of a new age—a rublier age—or the age of silence, to be made possible by the discovery of a Manchester chemist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One night, working alone in the solitude of his laboratory, Mr. S. J. Peachy, one of the lecturers of the Manchester College of Tech-nologyT^iscovered that it is possible to vulcanize rubber swiftly and perfectly by means of two cheap gases at a mere fraction of the cost of existing processes. The whole arrangement is so simple\ thet any unskilled person could manipulate it after a few hours instruction. The discovery has since been followed up with great perseverance and assiduity, and it is now recognized by the rubber experts that the Peachy process will be useful in dozens of ways in the manufacture of such commodities and necessities as boots, clothing, paving, floor covering, upholstery, tiles—in fact the whole waterproof industry will undergo a change revolutionary in character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly what a welcome change is here suggested, for we all—especially those amid the traffic and bustle of town life — realize more or less the terrors underlying the nerve-racking noises of the present time. Bible students are also among those who view this and similar discoveries with favor; for they verily believe that a certain amount of quietude, especially amid the surroundings of delightful nature, induces a calm, restful, meditative spirit, a mental concentration so essential for the exercise of the higher impulses. This they believe will be a necessary adjunct to humanity in the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophet Isaiah also tells of an age of quietude—“In returning and rest shall ye be saved, in quietness and confidence shall be your strength&quot;. Again, “The work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever: my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in quiet resting places&quot;.—Isaiah 30:15; 32:17,18, So much for this point of view. And now comes still another foregleain which we may term the 'world’s wireless concert’. To explain this we cannot do better than quote the words of the Italian, Aldo Cassuto, whose voice was flung nine hundred miles away, from London to Rome. He says: “Speaking to somebody who is nearly a thousand miles away, with nothing between us but ether, is a strange sensation. The men who are listening to me are people I know. Some of them are very good friends, and I can imagine I see their faces bearing the marks of anxiety for the success of the coming miracle. I throw my voice into the mouthpiece, and I tell them that I am the friend they know, that they should recognize my voice, that I am very glad to talk with them. But I cannot have an answer from them. The wireless stations in Rome are not powerful enough to transmit the voice to such a distance. They are condemned to be dumb: I am condemned to be deaf. Will they hear me? I must confess I did not feel quite sure of it until T saw the wireless telegram of my editor at Rona*, announcing that the message got through all right.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This recalls another remarkable incident in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">London government building, when in the presence of some members of Parliament </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">colonel entered into conversation with some air men who were travelling miles away at great speed in their machines. The voices of the air men, including one of their songs, were heard distinctly by the honorary gentlemen, who were all keenly interested in the experiment. As a further proof of the bona-fideness of the messages sent and received, the airmen were asked to assemble in the evening at a certain place to dine, which was accordingly verbally accepted and fulfilled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What a marvelous foregleam of the Golden </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">/.ge </span><span class="font6">this news becomes! Even at its birth we ere astonished, and we can well foresee that soon as such lines of communication are perfectly established, two or more individuals </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">thousand miles apart will be able to converse and reach a decision. And what a great convenience this may be for those grand worthies when they rise from their sleeping condition— Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. Joseph, Moses, Joshua, David and such like—who, as representatives </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jesus Christ and His bride the &quot;little flock”, will be the visible representatives in the glorious kingdom to be established world-wide. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus the handicap of distance will be largely mitigated;, for if David happened to be in London, Joseph in New York, and Abraham and others in&gt;Jerusalem, thoughts and reflections over any given matter could be communicated one to another immediately, and one-ness of viewpoint maintained. Thus—“BA sendeth forth his commandment upon the earth, and his word runneth swiftly.&quot; (Psa. 147:15) &quot;The glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together/’—Isaiah 40:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With such inventions before us, coordinating as they do with the fulfillment of prophecy and the Bible time-features, what reverential student can doubt that we are living in the very dawu of the Golden Age»* which is so beautifully picturecFin the Divine Word? The majority of the people are blind to this great fact. Indeed, is it not again foretold by the same Daniel— beloved of God—that 'tlm wise &lt;»nly win understand. no^e &lt;*f the wicked shall understand’ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font6">—Daniel 1^:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the present time the wise in the Lord's sight see men struggling on and on. many of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font6">selfishly grasping the benefits of each </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font6">invention as some new toy for personal aggrandizement, while many are using other contrivances in the shape of the merciless instruments of destruction on their fellows for selfish ends. But when the storm now bursting upon the human race with such relentless </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fury </span><span class="font6">and, thank God! never to be repeated, is over, then mankind will have learned somewhat of that needed lesson, 'The fear [reverence] </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. (Psalm 111:10) Chastened, distressed, and hmSbled to the dust they will perceive that no real lasting progress toward happiness and life is possible unless there is restored this disposition as the-basic principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The fear of the Lord” will then become </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d </span><span class="font6">veritable ''fountain of life”, and each heart, in consequence, will gradually become righteous. They will then learn to know God, and this knowledge will cause their hearts to pulsate with increasing affection, and the more so as they realize the unutterable goodness of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font6">displayed in providing in His plan and purpose ‘a ransom for all' through the sacrifice of the man Christ Jesus, the only begotten Son of God. And when in the Millennial day mankind will see the results of the Atoning Sacrifice— how that, in consequence, all those who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">died in Adam will awaken by power divine and be given a fair opportunity to come back into complete harmony with God — then they will realize that the “love of God is broader than the measure of man’s mind”. Then the wonderful science of human ingenuity will be of practical, wholesome utility in every homestead, as under the auspices of the best of governments nothing will be allowed for another’s detriment </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">this will mean general comfort, pleasure and edification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the precious reservoir of blessing from the dear Lord’s hand will flow freely—a congenial climate, dependable seasons, fertility of soil, and more important still, His spirit will be poured on all flesh. Thus gradually mental, moral and physical health will be restored. Pain, fear, headache, heartache and sorrow will vanish like mists before the sunrise; and the last enemy to be destroyed will be death. No wonder we are told through the beloved Apostle John that every creature who will choose the way of wisdom, love and life will say with gratitude: &quot;Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and forever”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Blasting Out Stumps:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">H</span><span class="font6">AVING in my first article told how to make primers and what kind of dynamite to use for stump blasting, I will now try to describe the best way to make and load the holes for removing stumps, and in my next I will take up the simpler subjects of boulder-breaking and subsoil ipg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are two classes of stumps to be considered, viz., tap-rooted and lateral or spreading rooted; and an entirely different method of procedure must be adopted in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tap-rooted stumps have one large root running straight down into the earth for a considerable distance, and the idea is to remove this root to a depth that will permit cultivation without interference: and two or three feet is none too deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to find out just what your stump is like belpw the surface, you must feel the roots out in some way: and for this purpose a probe of three-eights inch steel, four feet long is about right. Buy five feet of steel; and when your handle is turned on, your probe will be about four feet in length. Sharpen to a pencil point. By using this to probe about your stumps you can tell to a nicety the kind of roots that hold the stumps, and how and where they are located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having found that your stump is a tap-rooted one, remove a few shovelfulls of earth from one side of stump so as to expose top of main root. Now with auger bore a hole not less than inches in diameter (2 inches is better), slanting the hole downward at an angle that will bring the point of your hole about three-fourths through the root when you are down the desired depth. Having completed the hole and prepared your primer, you are now ready to load the hole for blasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a stump one foot through at the cut, use about one and one-half sticks of by 8 inch dynamite, 40 percent strength for load. Take whole $tick and with a sharp knife slit same lengthwise in two or thn<sup>i</sup>e places, being sure to cut whole length of stick each time. Now slip slit stick into hole and with a wooden tamping stick (an (dd r.ake or fork handle cut off square on the end is &amp;&nbsp;very good one) press, not ram, tightly inter hole. Then using the half cartridge for your primer place it on top of the stick already in hole and set the primer by pressing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By C. E. Raij</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">uh</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">down gently with the tamping stick. Do not slit the primer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now throw a little fine dirt into hole and press down gently with tamper, continuing this until you are four inches from dynamite, when you can ram tamping solidly: and the better your hole is tamped the better results you* will get. Damp clay makes an excellent tamping; but almost any </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">damp</span><span class="font6"> earth can be used to advantage. When tamping is completed, throw back the earth around top of root and tread it firmly into place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be very careful when loading not to cut-, kink or bruise the fuse, as this will make trouble for you. Now split the end of fuse protruding from top of hole, light and retire rapidly; and soon you will have one less stump on your farm to vex and annoy you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For stumps larger than one foot through at the cut, use one more stick of dynamite for each six inches extra at cut until you are up to thirty inches, and above this use two sticks extra each six inches. These rules apply to sound stumps on heavy soils which have been cut long enough for the small fibrous roots to be rotted off. For green stumps increase loads about one-third over and above table. If tap roots are hollow, do not try to blast with fuse but wait awhile and I will tell you how to do it electrically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When blasting lateral-rooted stumps, first find which side of stump has the heaviest roots and where they are located. Having done this, start your hole on opposite side of stump, out from stump about two feet, and punch hole at an angle that will bring the point of your hole somewhat past centre of stump and looking toward heaviest roots when about two feet and a half or three feet deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a stump one foot in diameter at cut use about three sticks of 1J by 8 inch dynamite, 40 percent strength. For stumps larger than this, use one more cartridge for each extra six inches at cut up to two feet, and then use two more, or say seven sticks for a thirty-inch stump. Don't try anything larger with one hole, as it will not be profitable. For smaller stumps you must experiment a little to get the right load, but if it is necessary to blow a stump at all, I never use less than two sticks or one pound under it. Some of the booklets issued by. powder com- •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">panies advise lighter loads than I advocate, but I have found by hard experience that the above charges are none too heavy for sound stumps on heavy soil. But if blowing green stumps or working in light soil you had better increase the load one-third. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If stumps are quite rotten and hollow, clean rubbish out of center and tamp full of earth before loading. Do not lighten up much on the charge: for hollow stumps come hard. The directions I have given- you for loading apply in all cases except when holes are wet or muddy. In such cases thoroughly soap, or grease your fuse with leaf tallow, being sure to fill it in well around cap where it crimps onto fuse. Do not use any light grease or oils for this purpose, as they will penetrate fuse and cause hangfires or misfires; and if holes are not to be fired at once do not load wet holes with fuse. If a shot does not explode in due time it is called a hangfire, and if it does not explode at all it is a misfire; and both these are caused by damaged, kinked or broken fuse, or by grease, oil or dampness penetrating to the train of powder contained in fuse, and retarding or extinguishing the spark traveling in it. When a hole hangs fire, do not be in a hurry to investigate unless you are tired of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never go near a shot that fails to explode for at least one hour, and it is better to leave it alone over night if possible. I will tell you how to handle a misfire later on. Now a few general suggestions and this article is ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be careful with your dynamite and supplies for blasting. Don’t get excited if everything does not work together just right: and. if far enough away from buildings to insure safety, do not be afraid to load your first holes heavy enough to do the trick the first time: for if you fail to destroy your stump the first shot, you have a hard problem, as the dirt is so loosened by the first shot as to make the placing of a second one almost an impossibility. If stumps are broken up and thrown too much, and if large holes are left in the ground, you are loading too heavily. Beech and maple stumps come out pretty well: elm and hickory are tougher, and basswood and pine are very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After lighting your fuse, run in such a direction that when you turn to watch the blast you will have the sun at your back and not in your eyes. Do not watch the stump, but look up into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the air </span><span class="font6">and watch flying pieces; and do not be in a. hurry to rush hack as semetimes a piece is thrown high in air and remains there several</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark40"><span class="font6">seconds. If you hurry you may get back in time</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark41"><span class="font6">to meet it, with disastrous results'; and at very</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark42"><span class="font6">least, if you inhale the smoke you will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have a</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark43"><span class="font6">headache. Therefore do not hurry </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">back, but</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark44"><span class="font6">wait a minute or two.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark45"><span class="font6">If you wish to light several holes at one time,</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark46"><span class="font6">stick a wad of cotton-batting soaked in gasoline</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark47"><span class="font6">on the split end of each fuse and light with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a .</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark48"><span class="font6">torch, or simply split fuse and touch with hot</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark49"><span class="font6">iron. I prefer the latter method. Count your</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark50"><span class="font6">holes as you light them, and also count them as they explode so as to make no mistake </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as to </span><span class="font6">whether or not all went off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">As to tools, you will need the probe before ! mentioned, and for boring tap-roots you will ; need a two-inch* auger on which you must have ? welded a shank long enough to lengthen the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark51"><span class="font6">hole out to about four feet. On one end of shank</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark52"><span class="font6">there must be an eye through which to pass the 1 handle. If you use an auger for dirt holes, you</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark53"><span class="font6">can use this same one: or you can make one</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark54"><span class="font6">specially for dirt by using an old two-inch wood .</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark55"><span class="font6">auger, and saving your good one for boring 1 roots.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you wish to punch holes, you can use a common crowbar if you have only a few holes ' to make; if you have many holes you will find a T bar about the thing. For,this take a piece of inch P<sup>l</sup>P<sup>e</sup>&gt; and weld a piece of 1| inch octagon steel into it at one end, and sharpen the steel to a pencil point. Onto the other end</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.of pipe screw a inch T and into each side of this screw a piece 'of IJ inch pipe about six__</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">or eight inches long, and your bar is complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By keeping a little water ahead of bar in hole, you can- punch holes rapidly in almost any soil, but you will he spattered somewhat. A good way is to punch as far as you can handily, and then finish help with auger. Now a long spoon (made by any blacksmith) to remove any loose dirt from hole, and your outfit is complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whole thing will cost about $10.00, one half this being needed for a wood auger. Now go ahead, and remember that the suggestions as to loading, etc., nre to give you an idea of how to start. Watch results of first shots, and increase or decrease your charges as necessary. Use your head, and remember that stump-blasting is your hardest proposition. Boulder breaking and subsoiling are easier, and I shall treat on them next</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Castile Soap:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HE Revision Committee of the U. S. Pharmacopoeia meets this year to make such changes in that august volume as experience in medicine and pharmacy of the past decade seems to indicate. Members of medical, pharmaceutical and related bodies are invited /to make such suggestions on improvements as they have found to be of practical value. In this connection, E. V. Kyser, in a paper read at a recent meeting of the American Pharmaceutical Association, suggests that (dive oil be replaced by other oils in the manufacture of both hard and soft soaps. He savs: “The purpose for which a soap is to be used should determine its composition. The ingredients used in the soaps of the Pharmacopoeia and the methods of manufacture directed are not economical to use and do not produce the best finished products.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The official soap of the IL S. Pharmacopoeia, familiarly known as “castile soap,” is made from olive oil and sodium hydroxide. The term castile soap, which signifies a pure olive oil soap, means very little today; for this once highly recommended soap has been replaced by other soaps which are superior in quality and which can be produced more economically. While olive oil fs a non-drying oil, it is composed of a large proportion of unsaturated glycerides, as evidenced by its high iodine value, which is undesirable for soap-making* purposes. Olive oil soap, as well as other soaps made from unsaturated oils,readily decomposes, and quickly becomes rancid. In the manufacture of soaps for the toilet, the use of corn, cotton seed, soja, peanut or any other oils of low titer and high iodine value is objectionable; for the resultant soaps become rancid very readily. Yet olive oil, which is similar in chemical composition to the oils named, is used and recognized by the Pharmacopoeia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This preference for olive oil soap no doubt originally arose from the fact that olive oil was the only oil suitable for soap making which was not native, in suitable quality and quantity, when this manufacture of soap was in its infancy. A‘fter the industry was established, this preference was, of course, fostered by interested manufacturers for their own profit. The general public has long since been won away from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr, W, (J. Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">preference for olive oil soap, by the substitution of other and better soaps. But the conservatism of the Pharmacopoeia makers has prevented any change in this authority. Olive oil soaps are neither chemically nor physically adapted for general use. They have a disagreeable odor, are unsightly in appearance, do not produce a good lather, and have loss value as detergents than soaps made from other oils and fats. Moreover, they are generally made by the semi-boiling method, which at times fails to insure complete saponification. This process is also open to the objection that any impurities present in olive oil are retained in the finished soap. Olive oil soap also contains a high proportion of water, the Pharmacopoeia allowing thirty-six percent of moisture in the soap in hars, and ten percent in the powdered soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The U. S. Pharmacopoeia is the only place where olive soap (castile soap) is given the preference. £n aff the purchases of soap made by the L United States Government, State and -Municipal Governments, except in the' cases where the L. S. P. soap is named, the specifications stipulate that the soap shall be a milled soap, with eighty percent tallow and twenty percent cocoanut oil as a base.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>The Barrier of Disease</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">ACCORDING to Dr. Hugh S. Cumming, Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service, disease and famine are forming an effective barrier to a resumption of normal world trade. His report, after two years ’study, on the ground, of Conditions in Europe and Asia, throws light on the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of the world have, on account of suppression of the news by the press little idea of the havoc being wrought by disease. The man-power of the world is woefully short. War casualties account for some of this, but influenza killed off more than war did. Hardly a spot on the face of the globe escaped the ravages of this pestilence. War and disease are responsible for an enormous shortage in labor. Furthermore, the production of large quantities of raw materials and foods in Asia and in central and eastern Europe is reduced by the direct and indirect effects of the epidemic diseases now sweeping these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Complete statistics are not available for the suffering countries; but as the effects there are many times those of disease in this country, American statistics will do for comparison. Here, for each person gainfully employed there is a normal loss each year from sickness of nine days away from work. Most of this is preventable. In 1918 290,000 died from pneumonia, each case representing 125 days of sickness. Typhoid killed 13,000, each losing 450 to 500 days from work. Tuberculosis cost the patient 500 sick days, and there were 150,000 deaths from this disease. The number of days’ work lost through these diseases was: .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Pneumonia............... 36,250,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Typhoid ................. 6,175,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tuberculosis ............. 75,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Malaria.................. 42,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, Total.............. 159,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Malaria is added to the loss-producing diseases; for while seldom fatal, each of the 7,000,000 estimated cases of malarial fever causes a six-day stoppage of work, besides a general lowering of efficiency for weeks. If malaria were eradicated from the South, and other preventable diseases prevented throughout the nation, the increased efficiency in man power would far more than offset any losses , experienced from war and influenza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a number of Old World countries, production has ceased, or become inadequate as a result of disease. Since the war — which militarists and the clergy heralded as such a boon to mankind—large fertile areas have not been cultivated for several years, and industries are idle or partly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world is also facing an extensive spread of pestilential diseases, although these diseases could be controlled through proper treatment, if effective aid could he rendered in the areas afflictedS-Typhus fever is spread by the body louse: bubonic plague by the flea-infested rat: malarial fever by the mosquito. Enough is known to prevent such diseases from becoming a serious inrerjace, wherever the knowledge can be applied?- Nevertheless the diseases are spreading &quot;rapidly and creating enormous economic losses, to say nothing of the suffering and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">tropical countries malaria is much more prevalent than in the South, and is more deadly, in some of the West Indies causing twenty . percent of the deaths. The work at Panama <sub>9</sub>’ and elsewhere has demonstrated how completely malaria can be controlled by properly conducted sanitary operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Philippines a survey convinced experts . that the efficiency of labor might be increased thirty percent by the eradication of the hookworm disease, a condition fairly indicative of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a * </span><span class="font6">similar state of affairs in other parts of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark57"><span class="font6">world. This disease is spread by an </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">improper -</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font6">In 1917 in India there died from various preventable diseases:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cholera................... 267,002</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark59"><span class="font6">Smallpox ................. 62,277 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark62"><span class="font6">Total..................... 5,321,536</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">The doctors hope that under </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">League </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">j Nations a vast economic saving may be accomplished by a joint attack from the nations of ' ; the world upon the sources of disease. Perhaps j there might. But if the League is not more sue-cessful in preventing nations from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">making war </span><span class="font6">4 on one another than it is—one of the chief aims ■ of the proposition—there is not much hope of a successful attack upon the germ armies of the j world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Camming says that there is another </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">more important reason why this world disease situation concerns the United States-. We must be constantly alert to prevent some of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">these . </span><span class="font6">highly conununicable diseases reaching this country. The typhus fever that is raging in Asia and eastern Europe is filtering through ■ into western Europe. It will require the exer- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">cise of every precaution to prevent it from becoming epidemic in some of the European nations. If this should occur, it would be a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">gigantic task to keep the typhus from reaching the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even more dangerous, because more infec- ; tious, is the spread of bubonic plague from one ■ European port to another. During the past few <sub>y</sub>, years the plague gradually invaded one Medi- ' terrauean port after another, so that at present</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">there is probably no important port in that sea which does not harbor plague infection. This is regarded by the medical fraternity as a very serious situation, in view of the great increase in commerce which the United States will soon be carrying on with all the European ports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The defense of the United States against the world pestilence situation consists of the regular quarantine officers at the various ports ' of entry into the country, and a number of experienced quarantine officers in various points in Europe, who maintain a close watch on all important diseases ami keep the United States Public Health Service posted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pestilence danger confronting the nations is directly attributable to the World War and to the individuals and classes that plunged the nations into the war—the kings, kaisers and nobles, the militarists, the concerns that sought to make money out of war. the profiteers, and the war-loving clergy of al] countries who, had they stood like a rock against war instead of urging it on. might have prevented the deep misery and the further distress and trouble that attend the steps of a world now on the brink of immeasurable disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, the Great Healer is at hand and shortly will heal the wounds of war, pestilence and trouble: for the Golden Age is about to open under the hand of Christ, the Great Physician. God has known all along what men have been doing, and has permitted the evil, in order to bring in on a sounder foundation the letter times to come, as it written, “Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath smitten, and he will bind us up*'.—Hosea 6:1.</span></p>

The indispensable organic* salts remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All dried fruits should he thoroughly washed in several waters, then placed in cold water to soak over night. The water in which the fruit </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">been soaked should be used in cooking the fruit. The best way to cook dried fruit is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">turn the soaked fruit and die water in which it has soaked into a saucepan, bring the water to the boiling point, and then set it aside to simmer gently until done. Then lift out the fruit with a skimmer. Boil down the liquid and pour over the fruit. Sugar is not really necessary; but then, of course, tastes differ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Soak one-half cup of gelatine in one-half cup of cold water. Pour two cups of boiling water on one-third pound of prunes. Let them soak a little while, and then' wash and cook. When tender, remove the stones and chop the prunes; To the juice formed add enough boiling water to make two cups. Add this liquid to the gelatine with two-thirds cup sugar and one orange cut up. When thoroughly mixed, put in the prunes and oranges. Serve with whipped cream.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Color and Its Maker</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">P</span><span class="font6">ERFECT character is perfect balance, or nicety of poise between the qualities of a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">perfect being. Jehovah’s character is not only </span><span class="font6">the perfect standard but also the fountainhead of all character qualities. Some animals lower than man have certain items of character plainly marked; and these qualities are made use of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">inspired and uninspired literature as illustrations of desirable traits, often too lacking in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fallen man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wisdom, justice, love and power have long </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;been </span><span class="font6">recognized by careful students of the Bible as being the cardinal principles or characteristics of God, the Ruler of the universe. Some students have magnified His justice in such a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">way </span><span class="font6">as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">imply a dearth of wisdom and love. Others have talked of His love,as though justice were not coexistent. And still others, by intimating failure of His 'efforts/ slander His wisdom and power. None can fully sense His power, though some minds can believe that it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">exists and </span><span class="font6">that it is continually manifest in the works of Nature, both animate and inanimate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wisdom, justice and love are readily recognizable as being abstract principles, but power seems just a little different. It is more like the thumb to a three-fingered hand, or the base pole of an electric controller. Without it not one of the character elements can function. The honest difficulty in seeing black as a symbol of divine power is the statement of St. John:<sup>Cf</sup>He is light; and in him is no darkness at all”. Nevertheless, He made “thick darkness” to be swaddling clothes for the earth. The only solution seems to he that His personal, -subjective self knows no darkness, as light contains no black, but that the character picture which He has chosei^to give us is exemplified through TIis works rather than immediately. Though in light there is neither black nor white, yet in pigments there is black: and in Nature black is certainly indicative of strength — especially of.character strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each of^hese elements has an abstract and a concrete, a theoretic and a practical phase. The inert phase of wisdom is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hnou'leflge:</span><span class="font6"> but when wisdom is called upon to consider a single problem it cannot do so without the cooperation of power. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Discretion</span><span class="font6"> is applied wisdom, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">the very application calls for effort, is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">possible without it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font6"> is the precept of justice; but its practice becomes </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">righteousness </span><span class="font6">—for the practice power must lend a helping _ hand. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Benevolence</span><span class="font6"> is passive love, the very minimum of that noble trait; but an active love we call </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beneficence.</span><span class="font6"> Even power itself may </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">latent, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">might,</span><span class="font6"> or kinetic, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is also interesting to note not only that power is necessary for the exercise of the character elements, but also that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font6">-one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of these ’ </span><span class="font6">principles can be brought into action without measurable contributions from the. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">remaining two, as well. </span><span class="font6">Wisdom would </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not be wisdom that </span><span class="font6">were deaf to justice and love; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">love cannot </span><span class="font6">exist in all its fulness in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">presence of injustice and folly; justice cannot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ignore either </span><span class="font6">wisdom or love, for a man is not just at all until he loves his neighbor as himself. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In this con</span><span class="font6">nection it is appropriate to observe that rarely, if ever, does Nature display a primary </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">color— </span><span class="font6">rarely indeed a true binary. It is practically always found that some percentage of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">other </span><span class="font6">two primaries is discernible, even </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">where one </span><span class="font6">primary is in decided predominance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Jehovah all the cardinal principles work in perfect balance and accord. If </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">man were </span><span class="font6">perfect, as at the beginning, his </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">character, too, -</span><span class="font6">would be in perfect balance, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">true </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">image of </span><span class="font6">the perfect pattern. Even as it is there is enough fragmentary testimony in unbalanced man to enable him to appreciate these qualities and their beauty. IN the perfect life love prompts, wisdom devises, justice directs, and power performs every act. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As yellow is the illuminating color, so wisdom is the illuminating quality in a character. Hope is the outgrowth of w isdom, and joy is the outgrowth of hope — and yellow is the cheerful, happy color. Wisdom, therefore, may be called the yellow, the pleasant sunshine, of character. Blue is the cool, the shadow color: and justice is the reserved, the restrictive, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">directive </span><span class="font6">phase of character. Nothing else than justice could “mark the bounds </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of habitation” and say </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6"> the sea: &quot;Thus far shalt thou come, and no further<sup>7</sup>’. Would it be incongruous to speak of justice as the blue, the true blue of character? Faith is inseparable from justice; for faith is belief in integrity. As red is the color of action so love is the moving or motive principle among the others. Love is the thing hoped for, of which faith is the foundation. All the warmth there is in the world comes from love, all theV?heer and light from wisdom, and all the dependability and uprightness from justice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">OL'NDED as the result of a wager less than a year ago. with a capital of seventy pounds, all the money its eight backers could raise, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail,</span><span class="font6"> Jerusalem’s new Hebrew daily, now has a weekly English edition, is planning a similar weekly Arabic edition and has a steadily growing circulation which has already passed the three-thousand mark, according to Miss Rivka Aaronsohn, who recently visited New York to secure modern equipment and printpaper for the newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No successful newspaper has probably ever had such a strange line-up of editors and has been managed as is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Doar Hayom”, and Daily Mail.</span><span class="font6"> None of the board of eight editors is a newspaper man. One is a lawyer, another works with the English Occupied Territory Administration, the rest are in business in Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Each evening after their regular duties are ended, the board meets at the newspaper office and gets out the next morning’s edition,&quot; Miss Aaronsohn related. “Most of the men stay on the job until two and three o’clock in the morning. We have never missed a day yet, although sometimes we bandy had enough paper to print the edition and many times Ittamar Ben Avi got back from Egypt just in time with a supply of paper or with enough advertisements sold to continue operations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The newspaper has now become so prosperous than the families of its forty employes are living comfortably off it, according to Miss Aaronsohn. It is operated entirely on a cooperative basis, but the earnings received by the board of editors are placed hack in the treasury sy thet more modern equipment may be purchas'd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The strange beginnings of this little paper were told by Miss Aaronsohn as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;For many years the pioneer Jewish colonists of Palestine had been dissatisfied with the one Hebrew daily in Jerusalem. We wanted freedom of expression in our press; we wanted </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">paper with a broad policy looking to the future welfare of all Palestine. We wanted a good feeling among all the various classes in* </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pale</span><span class="font6">stine. But we couldn't express our views in the paper. Its editors wouldn't permit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;One day less than a year ago, Asher Saphir, a young Jewish colonist, who fought four years with the French, complained to one of the backers of the paper about its policy. ’Start another paper, why don’t you?’ retorted the editor. ’We will,’ answered Saphir. 'Ten pounds you can’t,’ rejoined the editor. Saphir took the bet and called us seven together. We combined our capital of seventy pounds, and on the additional credit we were able to get, together with seven-hundred pounds on advance payments of advertisements secured in Egypt and Palestine, had the paper running in a month/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Any one in Palestine can contribute to the paper,&quot; Miss Aaronsohn continued. &quot;No one is barred because his views differ from the editors'. We are working for the future upbuilding of Palestine and that can be accomplished only by freedom of expression. We started the English edition because there are so many English in Palestine now. We will start the Arabic edition so that all races and creeds will be brought closer together.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• Miss Aaronsohn claims that their paper, founded at first merely as a volunteer bit </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">work for the good of Jewish settlements </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">Palestine, bids fair to lie one of the best paying enterprises in the Holy Land. Their greatest handicap, she explained, was in. securing newsprint: and she was greatly surprised to learn that the shortage is just as acute in America, although there is no Egypt close at hand here, where an editor can run and bring back enough for the next day’s edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Great things are ahead of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Doar Hayom</span><span class="font6"> as Jerusalem increases and the capitals of the present great nations decrease in importance; for when the divine promise is executed, &quot;The Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep his commandments; and to make thee high above all nations which ho hath made, in praise, and in name and in honor’’ (Deuteronomy 26:18,19) Jerusalem is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">become the capital of the world forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">15.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> While *'darkness covers the earth. and gross darkness the people'’ what class among men is privileged to walk in the light of truth. /</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Those who will turn away from the mere speculations of men, and devote time to searching the Scriptures, not excluding reason, which Cod invites us to use (Isaiah 1:18), xv’ill find that a blessed bow of promise spans the heavens. It is a mistake to suppose that those without faith, and consequent justification, should be able to apprehend clearly the truth; it is not for such.—Psa. 97:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the child of God a lamp is provided whose light dispels from his pathway much of the darkness. “Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&quot; (Psalm 119:105) But it is only “the path of the just” that “is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day”. (Proverbs 4:18) Actually, there is none just, “none righteous, no, not one” (Romans 3:10); the class referred to is “justified by faith”. It is the privilege of this class only to walk in the pathway that shines more and more—to see not only the present unfoldings of God's plan, in the things to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While it is true that the path of each individual believer is a shining due, yet the special application of this statement is to the just '(justified) as a class. Patriarchs, prophets, apostles and saints of the past and present have walked in its increasing light; and the light will continue to increase beyond the present—“unto the perfect day”. It is one continuous path, and the one continuous and increasing light is the divine record illuminating as it becomes due.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">16. U'Ay </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">are many still sitting in darkness when they might walk in the light?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">The spirit of God, given to guide the church into truth, will take of the things written and show them unto us; but beyond what is written we need nothing; for the Holy Scriptures are able to make wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.—2 Timothy 3:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18. What </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Scriptural assurance have we that even the world shall not always remain in darkness?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">While it is still true that “darkness covers the-earth, and gross darkness the people,” the world is not always to remain in this condition. We are assured that “the morning cometh”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Isaiah </span><span class="font6">21:12) As now God causes the natural sun to shine upon the just and the unjust, so the Sun of Righteousness will, in the Millennial day, shine for the benefit of all the world, and “bring to light the hidden things of darkness”. (1 Corin-, thians 4:5) It will dispel the noxious vapors of evil, and bring life, health, peace and joy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">19.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> What was the nature of. the divine promises in past ages., and how has the “path of the jus?’ been progressive with respect to knowledge?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Looking into the past we find that then the true light shone hut feebly. The promises made to Abraham and others, and’ typically represented in the law and ceremonies of fleshly Israel, were only shadows and gave but a vague idea of God's wonderful and gracious designs. As we reach the days of Jesus the light increases. The height of expectancy, until then, had been that God would bring a deliverer to save Israel from their enemies, and to exalt them as the chief nation of the earth, in which position of power and influence God would use them as His agency for blessing all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The offer given Israel of heirship in the kingdom of God was so different, in the conditions demanded, from what they had expected, and the prospects of the class being selected ever attaining the greatness promised were, outwardly and humanly considered, so improbable, that all but the few were thereby blinded to the message. And their blindness and hostility to </span><span class="font5">ir </span><span class="font6">which naturally increased when, in the process of God's plan, the due time camp for extending the message, and making the invitation to share in the promised kingdom applicable to every creature under heaven who should by the exercise of faith be reckoned a child of faithful Abraham and an heir of the promise made him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20. TF/iaJ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">was the special light brought by our Lord Jesus at His first advent ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">But when the gospel which Jesus taught came to be understood after Pentecost, it was seen by the church that the blessings for the world were to be of an enduring character, and that for the accomplishment of this purpose the kingdom would be spiritual, and composed of Israelites indeed, a “little flock” selected from among both Jews and Gentiles to be exalted to spirit nature and power. Hence we read that Jesus brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. (2 Timothy 1:10) And since Jesus' day yet more light shines, as He foretold it woiild, saying, “I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now; howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth, . . . and he will show you things to come.”—John 16:12,13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">There came a time, however, after the apostles fell asleep, when the majority of the church began to neglect the lamp, and to look to human teachers for leading; and the teachers, puffed up with pride, assumed titles and offices, and. began to lord it over God’s heritage. Then by degrees there came into existence a special class called “the clergy”, who regarded themselves, and were regarded by others, as the proper guides to faith and practice, aside from the Word of God. Thus in time the great system of Papacy was developed by an undue respect for the teachings of fallible men and a neglect of the Word of the infallible God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">22. How </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">was the nature of the Reformation movement, and why hare Protestants made *o little pioaress since the days of the reformers ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Serious indeed have been the evil results brought about by this neglect of truth. As all know, both the church and the civilized world were .almost wholly enslaved by that system, and lechCp worship the traditions and creeds of men. From this slavery a bold and blessed strike for liberty and the Bible was made, in what is known at The Reformation. God raised up bold champions for His Word, among whom were Waldd, Wycliffe, Luther, Zwingli, Melamdi-thon, and others. These called attention to the fact that Papacy had laid aside the Bible and substituted the decrees and dogmas of the church, and pointed out a few of its erroneous teachings and practices, showing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that they were </span><span class="font6">built upon tradition, contrary to truth, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">opposed to God's Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These reformers and their adherents were called Protestants, because they protested against Papacy, and claimed the Word of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font6">as the only correct rule of faith and practice. Many faithful souls in the days of the Reformation walked in the light, as far as it was then shining. But since their day Protestants </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">made little progress, because, instead of walking in the light, they have halted around their favorite leaders, willing to see as much as- they saw but nothing more. They set boundaries to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font6">progress in the way of truth, hedging in, with the little truth they had, a great deal of error brought along from the “mother” church. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font6">the creeds thus formulated many years ago^ the majority of Christians have a superstitious reverence, supposing that no more can be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">known </span><span class="font6">of God’s plans now than was known by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">reformers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This mistake has been an expensive one; for, aside from the fact that but few great principles of truth were then recovered from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rubbish </span><span class="font6">of error, there are special features of truth constantly becoming due, and of these Christians have Iteen deprived by their creed fences. To illustrate: It was a truth in Noah's day, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">one which required the faith of all who would walk in the light then, that a flood was coming, while Adam and others had known nothing of it. It would not be preaching truth now to preach </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">coming flood, but there are other dispensations! truths constantly becoming due, of which, if walking in the light of the lamp, we shall know; so, if we have all the light which was due several hundred years ago, and’that only, we are measurably in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God's Word is a great storehouse of food for hungry pilgrims on the shining pathway. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font6">is milk for babes, and strong nieat for those more developed J Peter 2: 2; Hebrews 5:14); and not only so, but it contains food adapted to the different seasons and conditions; and Jesus said the faithful servant should bring forth meat </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in due season</span><span class="font6"> for the household of faith—“things new and old,” from the storehouse.—Luke 12:42: Matthew 13:52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would he impossible to bring forth such things from any sectarian creed or storehouse. We might bring forth some things old and good from each, hut nothing new. The truth contained in the creeds of the various sects is so covered and mixed with error that its inherent beauty and real value are not discernible. The various creeds continually conflict and clash; and as each claims a Bible basis, the confusion of thought, and evident discord, are charged to God's Word. This has given rise to the common proverb, ‘‘The Bible is an old fiddle upon which any tune can be played”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How expressive is tbi<sup>4</sup>* of the infidelity of our times, occasioned by misrepresentations of God’s Word and character by human traditions, together with the growth of intelligence, which will no longer how in blind and superstitious reverence to the opinions of fellow-men, but demands a reason for tho hope that is in us. The faithful student of the Word should be able always to give a reason for his hope. The Word of God alone is able to make wise, and is profitable for doctrine, instruction, etc., &quot;that the man of God may be perfect. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">thoroughly furnished’. </span><span class="font6">—1 Peter 3:15; 2 Timothy .3: 15 - 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only this one storLmw contains an exhaust-less supply of things high now and old—meat in due season for the household. Surely no one who believes the Scripture statement that &quot;the path of the just sh.ineth more and more unto the perfect day’’ will claim that the perfect day came in Luthers time: and if not, we do well that we take heed to our lamp as unto &quot;a light that shineth in a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">drd: place</span><span class="font6"> rxTii- the day dawn”.—2 Petcr 1:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">25. - </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">If ire believe that perfection of knowledge is not a litifty of the past but of the future, why do we go back to the words of the apostles and prophets for all our knourt-ftige of the present aaid future !</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Perfection of knowledge is not a thing of the past, but of the future—the very near future, we trust; and until we recognize this fact we are unprepared to appreciate and expect ftesh unfoldings of our Lather's plan. True, we still go back to the words of the prophets', and apostles for all knowledge of the present and future : not. however, because they always understood God’s plans and purposes better than we, but because God used them as His mouthpieces </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">tu communicate to us,</span><span class="font6"> and to all the church throughout the Christian age, truth relative to His plans, as fast as it becomes due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This fact is abundantly proven by the' apostles. Paul tells that God has made known to the Christian’ church the mystery (secret) of His will which He had purposed in Himself, and had never before revealed, though He had it recorded in dark sayings which could not be understood until due, in order that the eyes of &lt;«ur understanding should be opened to appreciate the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“high calling&quot;</span><span class="font6"> designed exclusively for believers of the Christian age.—Ephesians 1:17, 18: 3:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This shows us clearly that neither the prophets nor the angels understood the meaning of the prophecies uttered. Peter says that when ’ the prophets inquired anxiously the meaning, God told them that the truths covered up in their prophecies were not for themselves, but for us of the Christian age. And he exhorts the church to hope for still further grace (favor, blessing) in this direction—yet more knowledge of God's plans.— 1 Peter 1:10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">28. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Although the Lord promised that the church slioald hr guided into all truth, in what manner evidently was the truth tn hr ttuf'ddrd .*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is evident that though Jesus promised that the church should be guided into all truth, it was-to be a gradual unfolding. While the church, in the days of the apostles, was free from many of the errors which sprang up under and in Papacy, yet we cannot suppose that the early &lt;&nbsp;hnrch saw as deeply or as dearly into God’s plan as it is possible to see today. It is evident, too. that the different apostles bad dififerent degrees of insight into God’s plan, though </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their u ritiitrjs</span><span class="font6"> wore guided'and inspired of God, as truly as were the words of the prophets. To</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">illustrate differences of knowledge, we have but to remember the wavering course, for a time, of * Peter and the other apostles, except Paul, when the gospel was beginning to go to the gentiles. (Acts 10:28; 11:1-3; Galatians 2:11-14) * Peter's uncertainty was in marked contrast with Paul’s assurance, inspired by the words of the prophets, God’s past dealings, and the direct <sub>t</sub> revelations made to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">27. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">What was the special value of the Apostle Paul’s ' visions and revelations, since he was not permitted tn * make them known either to the other apostles or to the ; church in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Paul evidently had more abundant revelations </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font6">any other apostle. These revelations he * was not allowed to make known to the church, nor fully and plainly even to the other apostles <sub>#</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2 Corinthians 12:4; Galatians 2:2) yet we can</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see a value to the entire church in those visions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font6">and revelations given to Paul; for though he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">not, permitted to tell what he saw, nor to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6"> particularize all he knew of the mysteries of God relating to the “ages to come”, yet what he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’ saw gave </span><span class="font6">a force, shading and depth of meaning to his words which in the light of subsequent * facts, prophetic fulfillments and the spirit’s * guidance, we are able to appreciate more fully </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' than </span><span class="font6">could the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">early </span><span class="font6">church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As corroborative of the foregoing statements, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">call to mind the last book of the Bible—Reve-, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lation—written about A. D. 96. The introductory</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">words announce it as a special revelation of things not previously understood. This proves conclusively that up to that time, at least, God's plan had not been fully revealed. Nor has that . book ever been, until now, all that its name implies—an unfolding, a revelation. So far as ' the early church was concerned, probably none understood any part of the Book. Even John, who saw the visions, was probably ignorant of , the'Mgnificance of what he saw. He was both a ■ prophet and an apostle: and while as an apostle he understood and taught what was then &quot;meat in due season”, as a prophet he uttered things <sup>1</sup> which would supply &quot;'meat&quot; in seasons future for the l\ous^hold.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">• has it been Jul fitted.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the Christian age. some of the saints sought to understand the church’s future by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">examining this symbolic book, and doubtless allwho read and understood even a part of its ' teachings were blessed as promised. (Revelation » J : 3) The book kept opening up to such, and iix ’ the days of the Reformation was an important ‘ aid to Luther in deciding that the Papacy&quot;, of . which he was a conscientious minister, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was . </span><span class="font6">indeed the “Antichrist” mentioned by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">apostle, the history of which we now see fills so large a part of that prophecy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus gradually’ God opens up His truth and * reveals the exceeding riches of His grace; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and ■ </span><span class="font6">consequently much more light is due now than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at * </span><span class="font6">any&quot; previous time in the church’s history.

<p><span class="font6">Even from the standpoint of the skeptic, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a : </span><span class="font6">reasonable and candid search into the unknown, by the light of what is known, will guide the unbiased, intelligent reasoner in the direction of the truth. Yet it is evident that without </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a . </span><span class="font6">direct revelation of the plans and purposes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">God, men could only’ approximate the truth, and arrive at indefinite conclusions. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But let us </span><span class="font6">for the moment lay aside the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible and look at </span><span class="font6">* i things from the standpoint of reason alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He who can look into the sky with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a telescope, </span><span class="font6">or even with his natural eye alone, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">see there </span><span class="font6">the immensity of creation, its symmetry, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">beauty, ■ </span><span class="font6">order, harmony&quot; and diversity, and yet </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">doubt </span><span class="font6">that the Creator of these is vastly his superior in both wisdom and power, or who can suppose for a moment that such order came by- chance, without a Creator, has so far lost or ignored the faculty of reason as to be properly eon-sidered what the Bible terms him, a fool (one who ignoresorlacks reason) : ‘The fool hath said * in his heart. There is no God”. However it happened, at least that much of the Bible is true, ■ as every reasonable mind must conclude; for it is a self-evident truth that effects must be produced by competent causes. Every plant and (‘very’ flower, even, speaks volumes of testimony on this subject.

<p><span class="font6">Some who deny the existence of an intelligent Creator claim that nature is the only God, and that from nature all forms of animal and vegetable developments proceeded without the ordering of intelligence, but governed, they say, by “the law of the survival of the fittest’’ in a process of evolution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This theory lacks proof; for all about us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">see that the various creatures are of fixed natures which do not evolve to higher natures; and though those who hold to this theory have made repeated endeavors, they have never succeeded either in blending different species or in producing a new fixed variety. No instance is known \Vhere one kind has changed to another kind.* Though there are fish that can use their fins for a moment as wings, and fly out of the water, and frogs that can sing, they have never been known to change into birds; and though there are among brutes some which bear a slight resemblance to men, the evidence is wholly lacking that man was evolved from such Creatures. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font6">the contrary, investigations prove that though different varities of the same species may be produced, it is impossible to blend the various species, or for one to evolve from another/For the same reason the donkey and the horse, though resembling each other, cannot be claimed as related; for it is well known that their offspring is imperfect and cannot propagate either species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Surely if unintelligent nature were the creator or evolver she would continue the process, and there would be no such thing as fixed species, since without intelligence nothing would arrive at fixed conditions. Evolution would be a fact today^nd we would see about us fish becoming birds, and monkeys becoming men. This theory we conclude to bo as contrary to human reason as to the Bible, when it claims that intelligent beings were created by a puwer lacking intelligence. V \ ----</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">that the grandest thing created is. not superior </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">y to its </span><span class="font6">Creator; hence -we must conclude that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">greatest </span><span class="font6">manifestation of benevolence and just-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’ ice </span><span class="font6">among men is inferior in scope to that of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Creator, even as </span><span class="font6">man’s wisdom and power are inferior to His.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> But </span><span class="font6">further: having reached this reasonable </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">conclusion </span><span class="font6">relative to the existence and char-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">!

The answer comes, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that the </span><span class="font6">possession of such attributes reasonably argues their exercise, their use.

<p><span class="font6">What could be more reasonable than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">such * '<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font6">exercise.of power as we see manifested in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">file </span><span class="font6">creation of countless worlds about us, and in the wonderful variety of earth?

<p><span class="font6">We may reason that in creating man, had divine wisdom decided it inexpedient to grant </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">knowledge of his future destiny, and his share in Iiis Creator's plans, then surely divine justice, as well as divine love, would have insisted that * the being should be so limited in his capacity that he would not continually be tormented and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'ll</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">So, then, in view of these considerations, even </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">if we </span><span class="font6">were ignorant of the Bible, reason would lead us to expect and to be on the lookout for some such revelation as the Bible claims' to be.

If of (rod, its teaching, when fully appreciated, will accord with his character, which reason assures us is perfect in wisdom, justice, love and power.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Bible is the torch of civilization and liberty.

<p><span class="font6">Admitting that while he lived </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus was ar </span><span class="font6">remarkable person, in both his life and his </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">teach</span><span class="font6">ing, what motive could there have been for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font6">to espouse his cause after he was dead! — especially when his death was so ignominious</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">t </span><span class="font6">And if we suppose that these writers invented their narratives, and that Jesus was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font6">imaginary or ideal hero, how absurd it would be to suppose that sane men, after claiming that he was the Son of God, that he had been ■ begotten in a supernatural way, had supernatural powers by which he had healed lepers, restored sight to those born blind, caused the deaf to hear, and even awakened the dead—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font6">very absurd to suppose that they would wind up the story of such a character by stating </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">a little band of his enemies executed him as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">felon, while all his friends and disciples, and among them the writers themselves, forsook, him and fled in the trying moment!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that profane history does not agree in some respects with these writers should </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not ' </span><span class="font6">lead us to regard their records as untrue. Those who do not thus conclude assign and prove some motive on the part of these writers for making • false statements. What motives could have prompted them? Could they reasonably have hoped thereby for fortune, or fame, or power, or any earthly advantage? ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT ASTONISHES THOSE WHO TERM THE BIBLE A MANUFACTURED HISTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the contrary, if such had been the object of those who preached Jesus, would they </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">speedily have given it up when they found that it brought disgrace, persecution, imprisonment, stripes and even death? Reason.plainly teaches that men who sacrificed home, reputation, honor and lite: who lived not for present gratification; but whose central aim was to elevate their fellow-men. and who inculcated morals of the highest type, were not only possessed of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">motive, but that their motive must have been pure and their object grandly sublime. Reason further declares that the testimony of such men, actuated only by pure and good motives, is worthy of ten times the weight and consideration of ordinary writers. Nor were these men fanatics: they were men of sound and reasonable mind, and furnished in every case a reason for their faith and hope; and they were perse-veri ngly faithful to those reasonable </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">convic</span><span class="font6">tions.</span></p>
