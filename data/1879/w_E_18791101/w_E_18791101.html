<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Babylon is Fallen.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.&quot; `Rev. 18:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The word &quot;Babylon&quot; means </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">confusion.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It is here used symbolically, since the literal city by that name was at the time of this writing &quot;a mass of ruins.&quot;  The literal city was doubtless a figure or type of the symbolic city, and much of the threatening of `Isa. 21`, and `Jer. 50`, and `51`, is unquestionably of two-fold application and fulfillment: first, upon literal Babylon, the type and more fully upon symbolic Babylon, the antitype.  Both are called &quot;Babylon the Great.&quot;  Both rule over the kings of the earth.  The literal was built upon the river </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Euphrates</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and derived wealth and splendor from this source.  &quot;O thou that dwellest upon many waters.&quot; `Jer. 51:13`. The symbolic is said to be &quot;seated upon many waters--peoples, nations &amp;c.,&quot; from which it derives its support.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The fall of the literal was by the turning aside of the waters, and the drying up of the Euphrates.  And the symbolic river Euphrates is said, in connection &quot;with the fall of symbolic Babylon, to be dried up.&quot; `Rev. 16:12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Each is compared to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stone cast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">into the water.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise.&quot; `Jer. 51:64`. &quot;Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down.&quot; `Rev. 18:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now let us inquire what is represented by the symbol.  As originally planted by Jesus and his apostles the church was a &quot;chaste virgin espoused to one husband, even Christ.&quot; For some time she maintained her purity and suffered persecution of the world, but gradually became enamored of the world and the prospects it offered, and finally united with it, constituting the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">system</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Papacy.  This </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">system church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> living in union with the world constitutes &quot;the abomination&quot;--&quot;the harlot,&quot; and the name Babylon, meaning </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">confusion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is applicable because the world is called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a beast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the church </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a woman.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This then was the union of the woman and the beast which is expressly forbidden in type. (`Lev. 18:23`. &quot;It is confusion.&quot;)  We feel sure that we have the name Babylon properly applied since in `Rev. 17` we see the church seated on the beast--i.e. supported by and controlling the world.  &quot;And in her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and abomination of the earth.&quot; `Rev. 17:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The `following verse` shows that in her apostate condition she was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anti--</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (against) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for she was drunken with the blood of the saints and of the martyrs of Jesus.  Mark me--I do not say that all the members of the Catholic church became abominations to the Lord, but that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Papacy as a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> SYSTEM--church-state organization is here pictured.  And we must go further and implicate, (not the individual members, but the church systems) other churches united to the Empires of earth. Every church claiming to be a chaste virgin espoused to Christ, but in reality united to and supported by the world (beast) we must condemn as being in scripture language a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">harlot</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  To illustrate: The Episcopal is the established church of England--the Greek church, of Russia --the Presbyterian church, of Scotland--the Lutheran, of Norway, &amp;c.  The true church composed of all who love the Lord Jesus in truth and sincerity whether in or out of these organizations, who wait for the coming Bridegroom, he recognizes; but she that is joined to another he calls an abomination--a harlot. These are off-shoots from the Papacy.  She was a harlot and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mother of harlots</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we mean no disrespect to fellow christians when we term their church systems the daughters, and therefore parts of the system of confusion--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Babylon.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But you will say--Our churches in this country particularly, are not parts of the Babylon, because they are not church-state organizations. Wait a moment; Let us inquire: Is our church--Baptist, Methodist or which ever, is it a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chaste virgin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or not? Does she live with the world, or separate from the world?  We believe that every true church member loyal to the coming Bridegroom, feels with shame and pain that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is unfaithful to her espousal and is locked in the embrace of the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">She still bears the name of Christ and claims to be his.  She claims to be desirous of knowing and doing what would please the Lord, but actually studies and does what will please the world.  She has a form of Godliness but really is far from God-like-ness. Who studies as carefully, or obeys more implicitly the world's dictates as to propriety of dress and etiquette than professors of Christianity? Everything is done with an eye to the world's approval.  The sermon must be such as will please and entertain carnally minded men of the world, for they give tone and character and backing to the organization. These must be trustees and stewards and be made to feel an interest in her and give largely of their wealth. No matter how obtained, wealth she wants and wealth she must have. She has commenced the adaptation of herself to the ideas of the world, and cannot go back.  She felt that she must erect a grand church building with the tallest spire, and that every inch she added to the spire and every dollar added to the cost of building would help draw to her bosom some of the world's children with bags of gold. She lives luxuriously with the world, and is supported by the world.  Her homage to the world becomes almost a necessity when it is remembered that he really built the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">temple of fashion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in which she professes to worship God but really bows to mammon. The world though caressing and flattering, wants the interest on the church mortgage, and if the church cannot think of a way to get it scripturally, he has plans for festivals, grab games and church theatricals. She hesitates for a moment only, to thus disgrace and prostitute herself.  The money must be raised. It would be useless to ask the Lord for it since she disregarded his wishes by contracting the debt.  Necessity knows no law, and though the pure ones rich in faith, protest and weep for her condition, yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are the poor of this world, and the poor of the worldly church seldom occupy a church office of any influence, and their protests and entreaties are drowned by the exultant songs and shouts of the gay company who &quot;glory in their shame.&quot;  Enjoying the world's smile they exclaim: &quot;We are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing, knowing not that they are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.&quot; `Rev. 3:17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;O that thou hadst known even in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes we believe the nominal church of to-day to be the Babylon of our text, which falls.  It commenced to be a condition of confusion with the mother and it continues to the end of the age.  The church, anxious for numbers and money, has offered every inducement to get members, particularly those of wealth.  Socials are arranged at which the wives and daughters are expected (even though followers of Jesus) to so dress and act as to decoy and captivate worldly and carnally minded men.  Soon such a one is called brother and urged to join the church.  At first he feels shocked at being asked to become a church member.  He has heard of people being converted, having a change of heart &amp;c., but soon settles down to the thought that he is as good as others, that morality is the needed thing, and finding it to be a passport to the best society and an aid to business he does not long refuse. Now he is a member of church in good and regular standing; perhaps begins to like and feel interested in church affairs; becomes an officer in the Sunday school.  Now he is looked upon as one of the principal</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R45 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">members, a bell sheep, a representative of the flower of the flock. Who shall measure the baneful influence of this wolf in sheep's clothing upon the true sheep and lambs, supplanting truths with errors, ignoring true faith and trust and fostering and encouraging pride and worldliness, to say nothing of the effects upon the world when, it may be after having been years with the flock, this influential member is discovered to be a thief, who for years has systematically stolen from his employers, who had the utmost confidence in him because of his church connections?  So the whole flock becomes suspected of being hypocrites, until now very few business men consider it any recommendation to an employee, to know that he is a christian.  Nor should this be wondered at when we reflect that if any large defalcation or financial irregularity occurs you will find yourself as well as the infidel inquiring--Of what church is he a prominent member?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In this way the church--&quot;Babylon&quot; --has become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird,&quot; as shown in our text.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus prophesied of this in parable when he said--&quot;The kingdom of heaven (church) is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field, which, when grown, is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.&quot; `Matt. 13:31`. `Verses 4 and 19` show us that the birds represent the devil.  The church had a small beginning but afterwards spread out into many branches, and the representatives of the devil--hypocrites--wolves in sheep's clothing--came and lodged among the branches.  But our text says: &quot;Babylon is fallen.&quot;  What is the fall and when will it occur?  The fall we believe, will be from her exalted position of control and respect with the world, to one of ignominy and contempt.  The fall we expect will not be instantaneous; it will have a beginning and will gather momentum as it falls until it is dashed to pieces.  As to when her fall is due, we can perhaps learn something by examining the parallels between the Jewish and the Gospel church.  As has been shown heretofore, the Law was a shadow of the Gospel, and the Jewish</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R46 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">church under the law, a pattern of the christian church under the gospel; the one on the fleshly, the other on the spiritual plane, each called Israel.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We know how their age ended with the advent of Christ in the flesh, so he is to be present in the end of this age, a spiritual body.  We know that he called the end of that age a &quot;harvest&quot; to the fleshly house and that He also says: &quot;The harvest is the end of this world&quot; (age).  You will recollect that their age from the death of Jacob (Israel) to Christ's baptism--the beginning of their harvest --was 1841-1/2 years, and that the parallels show that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">harvest</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of this age and Christ's presence (a spiritual body) was due to commence in the fall of 1874, or 1841-1/2 years, from the spring of A.D. 33</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">when Jesus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(our Israel)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> died.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the proclamation of Jesus as the present king and bridegroom was made to fleshly Israel for three and one-half years from his baptism to his crucifixion but heeded by but few of that church, so we believe a similar work was done in the midst of the Gospel church with similar results.  As had been foretold by the prophet: &quot;He shall be a stone of stumbling to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">both houses</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Israel.  Both stumbled at the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manner</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his coming.  The Jew expected splendor and majesty, overlooking the fact that he must first be the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and by the grace of God taste death for every man.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Gospel church expected to see him coming in all his glory, whereas scriptures teach that when he appears in glory </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be with him and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">appear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with him; that &quot;The Lord my God shall come and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all thy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saints</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with thee.&quot;  They overlooked the fact that he taught that he would first harvest the earth and separate wheat from tares--true children from hypocrites--before he would cause them to &quot;shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&quot;  Many have stumbled, only a few recognize that we are living &quot;in the days of the son of man.&quot; (`Luke 17:26`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R46 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As at the end of his three-and-one-half year's ministry, Jesus wept over that church, gave them up and said: &quot;Your house is left unto you desolate,&quot; so we believe that at the parallel point of time--the spring of 1878, the nominal gospel church was given up and their house left desolate. Until the harvest of their age, all outward Jews--&quot;wheat and chaff&quot; were spoken to and of as Israel but Jesus did a separating work--&quot;His fan is in his hand&quot; to winnow the chaff from among the wheat and when the work of separation is accomplished the wheat only is recognized. So here true and false grow side by side in the church and together they are nominally &quot;The kingdom of Heaven&quot;--&quot;Let both grow together until the harvest&quot;-- but in the harvest of this age &quot;He will gather </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">out of his kingdom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all things that offend,&quot; &amp;c. `Matt. 13:30,41`. But since the spring of 1878 we believe that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> church is cast off and now only the wheat--&quot;the little flock&quot;--is to be considered the church and we believe this to be the date of the beginning of the fall of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Babylon church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the parallel to the date of the fall of the church of the Scribes and Pharisees--hypocrites, who encompassed sea and land to make one proselyte.&quot;  Their fall was gradual, so is Babylon's.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This rejection of the nominal-- Babylon church--by the Lord seems to be illustrated in the picture of the church in its seven stages. `Rev. 3:16`. The seventh or last boasting of her being rich, increased in goods, &amp;c., is pronounced by the Lord poor, naked, miserable, wretched and blind, and is spewed from his mouth. Once she was the mouth-piece of God; he spoke and taught through her, but now she is spewed out, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Babylon is fallen.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Who cannot recognize that Babylon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is now falling</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the esteem of the world, which points to its children as more honorable, honest and faithful than the many Pastors and great ones in the church, of whose fall into great sins we hear almost daily.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The public press now takes every advantage to sneer at, and compare the lives and acts of christians with infidels--thus saying--&quot;How is the mighty fallen?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There was much wheat in the Jewish church, when given up, so too there is much wheat among the chaff and tares of the Babylon church. As God cared for and separated every true grain of wheat in that given up church (among them was Paul) and called them out into the true Gospel church, so now in this harvest he cares for every grain and now calls to them by his word--`Rev. 18:4`. &quot;COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE, that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do you advise us to disconnect ourselves from the church?  I advise you to be separate from the world. If the church with which you are connected, lives in adulterous union with the world, you must, if you would keep your garments white, leave her, &quot;hating even the garments spotted by the flesh.&quot; `Jude 23`. With her condition, you can have no fellowship nor communion and the words of Paul `2 Cor. 6:15,18`, would apply to you: &quot;What concord hath Christ with belial? What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?  For ye are the temple of the living God.&quot;... &quot;Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord and touch not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unclean thing,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and I will receive you.&quot;  If on the contrary you associate with a company who live separate from, and endeavor to keep themselves unspotted from the world and bearing the fruits of the spirit--meekness, gentleness, patience, Godliness, brotherly-kindness &amp;c., be assured it is no part of Babylon.  &quot;Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching,&quot; but, &quot;building up yourselves in the most holy faith ...keep yourselves in the love of God.&quot;  But we have a standing as individuals aside from our church standing.  As individuals we have become joined to Christ and recognize him as our head and director. We have professed to have died to the world and to have become alive toward God through Jesus.  Is our life conduct in harmony with our covenant with Christ?  Are we entirely his?  Is it our meat and drink to do his will?  The profession is vain unless it is true.  &quot;His servants you are, to whom you render service.&quot; Our day is one of peculiar temptation from the world.  If in business, it seems to require every moment and every energy, and we are in danger of being swallowed up by the cares of this life which press upon us every moment.  Remember Jesus' words: &quot;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.&quot;--&quot;Be not overcharged with the cares of this life.&quot; Living in the world be not of it.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bro. G. W. Stetson.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Death has laid our brother low. He died at his home, Edinboro, Pa., Oct. 9th, 1879.  Though an event not entirely unexpected, since he has been seriously ill for some time, yet his death is a heavy blow to his many friends abroad as well as at home.  He was beloved and esteemed by his fellow townsmen of all denominations as well as by the congregation of which he was pastor. He had been a faithful under-shepherd, ever holding before his hearers, as the great incentive to holiness and purity of life, that which filled his own soul with joy and peace and helped him to live &quot;above the world&quot; --viz: The appearing of the Heavenly Bridegroom--The King of Glory, and our gathering together unto him.  Our brother was a man of marked ability, and surrendered bright prospects of worldly and political honors to be permitted to preach Christ, when the glories and beauties of the word of God dawned upon his heart.  The truth cost him much yet he bought it gladly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The funeral services (Sunday following) were held at &quot;Normal Hall,&quot; it being more commodious than any of the churches of the place, which through respect were closed, the pastors taking part in the services of the occasion.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The brother's dying request, that the editor of this paper should preach his funeral sermon, was complied with.  About twelve hundred persons attended the funeral services, thus giving evidence of the high esteem in which our brother was held.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His family and congregation will feel keenly their loss, yet sorrow not as those who have no hope.</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">IF thou art a vessel of gold, and thy brother but of wood, be not high-minded. It is God that maketh thee to differ.  The more bounty God shows the more humility he requires.  Those mines that are richest are deepest.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Why Did Christ Die?</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who oppose the vicarious offering of Christ, admit, of course, that he died, and to give an explanation of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cause</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of His death falls upon them, and it is attempted. They deny that in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">any sense</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He died in our stead, and one statement made in explanation is: Christ became </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of us,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to share </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us the ills of life, and die </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same reason</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> die, because being flesh, and the flesh life being forfeited, he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> die.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same teacher says: &quot;A little Scripture is worth more than a great deal of reasoning.&quot;  We accept this as true, because God's word is based on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">infinite philosophy,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is not always revealed, and even if it were stated in words would be so far above the grasp of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">finite</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> minds, that it would still remain unrevealed. He withholds the philosophy of some facts which are clearly revealed. If it be true that Christ died as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> merely, we must infer that it was as necessary that he should die for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">himself,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as that we should die for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ourselves,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the principle of the same philosopher (?): </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Each one must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer his own penalty.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Against such reasoning we are willing to set the word of the Lord and abide the issue.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cut off</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> BUT NOT FOR HIMSELF.&quot; `Dan. 9:26`. It has been attempted to make it appear that Christ's sacrifice consisted in giving up his glory with the Father, in becoming a man.  But even if it could be proven (which it cannot) that the Word becoming flesh was a cutting off, or a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> still that imaginary death could not be the one referred to in the above text.  Those weeks, as has often been shown, reached to the baptism of Jesus, where he being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ-ened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or more properly, in English, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anointed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he was manifested as the Messiah. And </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the weeks Messiah shall be cut off.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cut off</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> out of the land of the living: (not for himself) for the transgression of my people was he stricken.&quot; `Isa. 53:8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;For His life is taken </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">from the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Acts 8:33`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His voluntary condescension in laying aside His glory and riches, to become a man, or to take the body prepared for sacrifice, is an important fact, and as an expression of the love of Christ, one which we delight to see and present to others; but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">taking</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the body </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to be offered,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is surely not to be confounded with the &quot;offering of the body of Jesus Christ.&quot; `Heb. 10:10`.  &quot;Being found in fashion as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he became obedient unto death even the death of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cross.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Phil. 2:8`.  We are lower than the angels, &quot;And we see Jesus made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death,... that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man&quot; (but not for himself). `Heb. 2:9`.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> died, he became a man for that purpose.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;There is one God and one Mediator between God and men--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> MAN Christ Jesus, who gave </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">himself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the man) a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom for all,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c. (but not for Himself). `1 Tim. 2:5,6`.  The ransom or price of anything always takes </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the place of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the thing bought, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in that sense</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ gave his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the deliverance of man from death. `Heb. 2:14,15`.  In the same sense that He is our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Price,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He is our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Substitute.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If a man knows not in what sense He was our Ransom or Price, he cannot see in Christ our Substitute.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Adam is the natural man.  He lost his life, the natural life.  When he forfeited his life, we being in him forfeited ours, and &quot;so death passed upon all for in him all have sinned.&quot; To redeem Adam, secures the recovery of all.  Christ takes Adam's place, and thus the place of all, for Adam represents all.  As Adam was a natural man and lost his natural or flesh life, the Redeemer must become a man in order that he might have a flesh life to give as Ransom. Hence He took our nature, and for the purpose named. `Heb. 2:14,16`. Here is the point where Christ needed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than Adam.  Adam had but one nature--the human, while Christ had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the human and Divine. In Christ's earth life the human was manifest in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the Divine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">indwelling</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;glory</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as of the only begotten of the Father.&quot; `John 1:14`.  In Christ's risen and glorified life He wears the Divine form or image of His Father. The flesh </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ satisfied the claim as a Ransom, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> secured the resurrection and change to a spiritual body or form.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Had Christ been merely human his death would have been as Adam's, but a Mighty One is provided who could give away all that Adam, and all in him, had lost, and yet have an infinite fullness of life. &quot;He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit.&quot; `1 Pet. 3:18`. The Ransom secures man's recovery or reconciliation, but Christ's Divine life imparted to us secures eternal salvation.  &quot;Reconciled by His death, saved by His life.&quot; `Rom. 5:10`.  Thus Christ is the Redeemer, and also the second Adam, or head of a new and Divine race.  Oh the fullness of Christ! Man's life lost, if not redeemed must have been lost eternally, and man's life is redeemed, but Christ's flesh life was not redeemed, it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> given up forever.  He gave </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as man's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Substitute.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But was not Christ's flesh preserved and made alive?  Yes, but not made alive by the flesh </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but by the Spirit as shown above.  When it was raised it was made spiritual, for He was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;First Born</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the dead.&quot;  &quot;And that which is born of the spirit is spirit.&quot; `Jno. 3:6`.  As of Him so are all who are made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partakers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of His Divine nature, their mortal bodies will be made alive, but like His, &quot;it is raised a spiritual body.&quot;  If a mortal body quickened is of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">necessity mortal still,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> then indeed an enemy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reconciled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> may be an enemy still, (`Rom. 5:10`) as is claimed by some.  But if that is true then a vile body changed must be vile still, and when God converts the unconverted, they will be unconverted still.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Where then is our hope?  How strange that men will reason so strangely.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same writer who says Christ died because He was mortal, also says He died to get rid of His flesh, and show us the way into the holiest and that He went through as the First and our Forerunner, the last of which is true; but if as the same writer assumes Christ and the Saints are all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised in the flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">afterward,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> then how much does </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dying</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> help them to get rid of the flesh? Are such inconsistencies the marks of a &quot;clean theology?&quot;  Why do men continue to die if Christ is Substitute. He died to make men alive.  He found them counted dead.  Practically the work of Christ converts death into a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleep,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all who die.  Sleep implies waking. Absolute death knows no waking. We have the word of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that &quot;The maid is not dead but sleepeth,&quot; and &quot;Lazarus sleepeth.&quot;  They were to wake.  In the statement &quot;Man does not die,&quot; the word die is used in the same sense as Jesus used it, and those who cavil at the statement </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> what is meant, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same themselves.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Let them settle it with the Master.  He gained the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">deliver</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from death when he died. `Heb. 2:14,15`.  But he does not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">use</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that power (only in a few special cases) until the &quot;Times of Restitution.&quot;  The plan is to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">save</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and bring them to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the truth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">afterward.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  So in &quot;due time&quot; the fact that Christ gave himself a Ransom for all will be testified. `1 Tim. 2:4,6`.  Men born in that age will not even &quot;fall asleep&quot; for Adam's sin, and it will not be so difficult for them to believe in Substitution.  They will realize that the Ransom paid is what prevents the original sentence </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">passed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">upon all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">executed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon them.  Now, because we are exceptions to the rule, i.e. get the light or the knowledge of the truth before the &quot;due time,&quot; it seems more difficult to catch the idea of the Ransom. As we are now counted dead in Adam before we die, so we are counted redeemed in Christ, and we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dealt with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in regard to the truth as if we had actually been dead and raised again.  This is why those who now become partakers of the Divine nature are not raised in the flesh, like the rest of mankind, who have not heard the Gospel, but having here, like their Head, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">voluntarily</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts, are raised a spiritual body, and to a share in His work of restoring and enlightening the world.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of mankind will be raised in the same kind of life that Adam lost, and by the knowledge of the truth be begotten to a higher life.  If they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obey the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">law</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of that higher life, they will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but will be changed into the immortal state.  If they disobey they must die--the second death. Some talk of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">necessity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of death as if a change from mortality to immortality were death.  An egg is not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that develops into a chicken; a grub does not die that changes into a butterfly; &quot;Enoch was translated that he should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not see death.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who die in the future age will be as an egg with a germ of life implanted and begun to hatch, and then removed from proper heat and moisture.  No man will die eternally for Adam's sin.  Christ hath redeemed us once for all.  And he has redeemed all.  This salvation by Christ's death does not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">secure</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spiritual life for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">any,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it makes it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all.  The knowledge of the truth, which is the begetting power, is the gift of God to all.  But when the new life by the Spirit of Truth is begun, man is held responsible to obey.  The salvation by Christ's death is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;foundation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for repentance,&quot; because it is the goodness of God that leadeth men to repentance. Hence to ignore the value of Christ's death, is to belittle God's love and saving power.  For God commendeth His love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us. `Rom. 5:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are glad now this subject is agitated, as it is to us an additional evidence that the &quot;due time&quot; is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dawning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in which God's love in giving Christ as a Ransom for all, is to be made known.  Oh that those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">oppose</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it may not be of those who have known and then rejected.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Name of Jesus.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;What's in a Name?&quot; is often asked, implying insignificance, and it may make but little difference to a man whether he be called Peter, James, John, Moses, Aaron or even Joshua (Jesus) in times when these and other names are used without any reference to their signification. But in Bible study we are impressed with the idea that names are full of meaning.  They were given with reference to time, place or circumstance, past, present or future.  Some names were as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">monuments</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to remind of some special dealings of the Lord, and others were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prophetic.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The qualities, work or destiny of an individual was often expressed by his name.  When the direction of a life was changed it was sometimes indicated by a change of name.  Adam, indicates man's origin--&quot;of the earth, earthy.&quot;  Cain, is &quot;acquired,&quot; and the woman was mistaken in the value of the man she had gotten of the Lord.  Abel, is &quot;feeder,&quot; a shepherd, and fitly represents the great Shepherd of the sheep, who gave His life for them.  Abraham, means &quot;father of a great multitude,&quot; or &quot;of many nations.&quot;  His name was changed from Abram to Abraham when God made him the promise. (`Gen. 17:5`.)  And in reference to the same great plan Sarai was changed to Sarah, i.e. Princess (`ver. 15`.) These are prophetic in their character and point to the grand success of the gospel in bringing the nations to God, the Father of all, through the agency of the &quot;seed&quot; of promise--Christ and the Church-- the antitypes of Isaac and Rebekah. David, means beloved, a type of Christ, the true King of Israel. David as a prophet personifies Christ, and God makes promises to him as if he were Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The excellent language of David-- &quot;Thou wilt not leave </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">my</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> soul in the grave, neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption,&quot;--was fulfilled in the triumphant resurrection of Christ from the dead.  The name given is made to refer to position or official relationship, so that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">position is meant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when the word &quot;name&quot; is used.  Even in this sense &quot;a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.&quot;  The success of the Lord's work is to Him &quot;for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--an honor. `Isa. 55:13`.  To the obedient the Lord promises &quot;an everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`56:5`) &quot;but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the wicked shall rot.&quot; `Prov. 10:7`. To receive a prophet in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of a prophet certainly refers to his official character.  &quot;Thou shalt call his name Jesus because He shall save His people from their sins.&quot; Jesus, means Saviour, and we are carried forward from the mere </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">word</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the Exalted Official Position, on account of which He can &quot;save to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him.&quot;  His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">position</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is contrasted with that of men and angels, as He is Lord of both, having &quot;all power in heaven and earth.&quot;  Hence it is said, &quot;Let </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the angels of God worship him;&quot; [that must include Michael, the chief angel, hence Michael is not the Son of God] and the reason is, because He has &quot;by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inheritance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> obtained a more excellent </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than they.&quot;  Michael or Gabriel are perhaps grander names than Jesus, though Jesus is grand in its very simplicity, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">official character</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of God as Saviour and King is the inheritance from His Father, which is far superior to theirs, for it pleased the Father that in Him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all fullness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should dwell. He has given Him a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is above every name, that at the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Jesus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every knee should bow</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> both in heaven and earth.  And there is &quot;none </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">other</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With this view before our minds that the name refers to His official position, the importance of taking from among the Gentiles a &quot;people for His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be appreciated. As the wife takes the name of her husband, so the church takes the name of her Head.  The two made one is the fact of importance.  Not one in name merely, but in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fact,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as represented by the name--one in spirit, position, aim and work.  The difference between the terms Jesu-it and Christian may illustrate a point. The first relates to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">letter,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as Jesus is a proper name; the second relates more nearly to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as Christ means </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anointed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and refers to His official position.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are not here pleading for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but for what appears to be an important </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">idea.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  There is doubtless as much danger in using the name </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christian</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the name of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as in using other names.  The One Body knows </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> divisions.  All who have the spirit of Christ are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whether they fully realize it or not; one in spirit now and when glorified--married --one in every </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sense, even as the Father and Son are one. (`Jno. 17:22,23`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To be baptised into the name of Jesus (or Father, Son and Holy Spirit,) as in Him all fullness of the Godhead dwells, means far more than a baptismal </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">formula.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It is by the apostle expressed as being baptised by one spirit into one body (`1 Cor. 12:13`.)  There is letter and spirit in the subject of baptism as in almost every other part of God's plan.  We would not ignore or belittle either.  The letter </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represents</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the spirit, as a symbol or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;likeness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his death,&quot; and &quot;resurrection.&quot; `Rom. 6:5`.  Those who can appreciate the spirit need not and are not most likely to ignore the letter, but it seems important that we should guard against mere formalism.  In </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be baptised involves a death to sin, a rising into a new life of obedience, and a consequent formation of a character;--having &quot;your fruit unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holiness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the end everlasting life.&quot; `Rom. 6:22`.  &quot;As many of you as have been baptised into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">put on</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ.&quot; `Gal. 3:27`. &quot;Into one body!&quot;  &quot;Ye are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">members</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ,&quot; as in the figure used, bone of His bone and flesh of His flesh, (`Eph. 5:30`).  Do not confound the figure with the reality, do not imagine we will lose our individuality.  The body of Christ is a body corporate, each individual acting in harmony with each other and under the direction of Christ for the manifestation of God's love in the salvation of men.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The human body is used to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the church, but in this as in all other figures the reality is but dimly foreshadowed.  As Jesus is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anointed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so are we, and for the same purpose.  He is both King and Priest, so we are to be Kings and Priests--Kings to rule and Priests to bless.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To be baptised into His name is to become sharers in His spirit, His character, His official position and his work.  The power given to Him will be manifested through His saints.  He is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Saviour, but the body corporate will save the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He will continue to be our Head, but the church will be the Head of the world.  Adam was the head of his wife, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were the united head of the race.  The natural is the shadow of the spiritual.  Our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">position</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be higher than the highest angel.  We, like them, will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but as we for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little while</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lower</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than the angels, and in an important sense under their influence, they in this world being ministering spirits to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heirs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of salvation, so in the world to come, the church being then exalted to the throne of Him who is Lord of both angels and men, the &quot;saints will judge (rule) angels,&quot; and &quot;judge (rule) the world&quot; too.  In that day when every knee shall bow to the highest manifested authority--before the Messiah's throne--the Queen as well as the King will be there. Is it a false ambition, to look for such royal honor?  The voice of our coming husband sounds sweetly upon our ear as we struggle on amid the trials of this life.  The overcomer will sit with me </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in my throne.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Will he allure us on by such a hope to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">deceive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us?  Are the crown, throne and kingdom promised but unmeaning words?  Are our hopes in vain? Will they vanish in fulfillment? Away with the doubt, it is Satan's snare; our Lover is true and faithful, and He has &quot;all power.&quot;  Call it an unworthy ambition and selfish withal, do you?  Then God never would have given the inducement. If this hope of ours is selfish, then our Saviour is selfish.  For the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> set before </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">endured;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">benevolent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> selfishness.  His power is exercised to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bless.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The greater </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">serves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the less.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How else could we enter into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of our Lord than by reaching a position from which we can pour blessing on the needy?  He hath given Him a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> above every name.  Oh that we may realize our privilege of sharing it!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Baptised into the Saviour's death,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       With him we rise again;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  His spirit moves our every breath,</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Day of Judgment.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One great reason for the perverted views respecting the Messianic age, is the failure to understand the Bible meaning of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judgment.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It has several significations. Sometimes it means simply an examination or investigation of certain facts, testimony or arguments, in order to ascertain truth, or to reach a just decision.  We also use the term to express that quality of mind which enables one to correctly grasp the true conclusion; as we speak of a person having </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good judgment.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It often means the determination arrived at in the mind; also the results flowing from the trial and decision in the distribution of the rewards or punishments.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have been taught to associate the word, when found in the Scriptures, with the last mentioned meaning, i.e. the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">executive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> judgment, which signification it certainly has; nevertheless, it also and frequently refers to the trial itself while in progress. Notice the first occurrence of the word in the New Testament, `Matt. 7:1,2`, would clearly bear this rendering: &quot;Test not, that ye be not tested.  For with what judgment</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R49 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">[justice] ye test, ye shall be tested.&quot; The same word [Greek, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">krimati]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> here translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judgment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is used in `1 Cor. 6:7`, referring to law suits. &quot;Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">krimati</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [trials] one with another.&quot; During the Gospel age, the church have been having their trial. `1 Pet. 4:12,17`. And, in the millennial age, those who have stood the test and are accounted overcomers, shall share the throne with Jesus Christ our Lord, and shall rule over the nations during their trial; and having subdued all opposition will inaugurate the reign of peace, as it is written:</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Give to the King thy judgments, O God,</font><br />
<br />

This is not spoken of natural, but of spiritual light.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the people are in darkness; they &quot;stumble at his word,&quot; and murmur at his dealings.  But, says the prophet, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In that day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">see</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> out of obscurity, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">out of darkness.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.&quot; `Isa. 29:18,24`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">This spiritual light is no longer confined to the few; it is universal.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Wedding Garment.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No. Two.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the king came in to see the guests (assembled for the wedding), he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness.  There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  For many are called but few are chosen.&quot; `Matt. 22:11,14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the parable of Christ relates the history of the living phase of the gospel church, this closing scene must refer to the condition of those who are &quot;alive and remain&quot; and are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">expecting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to share the glory promised to the church.  All who were thus gathered by the servants, were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">supposed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be ready for the marriage, but the great Inspector, who knows even the thoughts and intents of the heart detects the lack and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sifts out</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the unfit.  The &quot;chosen&quot; are those who have that qualification represented by the &quot;wedding garment.&quot; The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who is without it, doubtless represents a class who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they were ready for the marriage, and were bitterly disappointed; their great sorrow may be expressed by the &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth.&quot;  As the wedding garment represents readiness, we can not be indifferent as to what it is.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two views of this subject which we wish to consider. Some believe that the wedding garment is a &quot;clean theology,&quot; and others that it is a &quot;holy character.&quot; Now we confess that the latter view strikes us as more in harmony with the spirit of the gospel and the teachings of the apostles.  We do not, however, ignore the importance of the knowledge of what our Father has been pleased to reveal in reference to His plans.  The apostle exhorts to &quot;grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&quot; `2 Pet. 3:18`.  Men are in danger of being extremists on this as on almost all other Bible themes--some making too much and others too little of the importance of knowledge of theory or correct theology.  But we are quite sure that the relation between knowledge of truth and character is not lost sight of by the apostles.  It is believed by some that it is not possible to have a right theory or theology, without its producing the right condition of mind and consequent obedience.  And such ones endeavor to be consistent with their theory by never talking or writing on practical themes, and never exhorting to obedience.  There is, however, a marked difference in this respect between the writings of such brethren and the writings of the apostles. There has been a time in the past when the writer of this was inclined to the extreme view that knowledge was sufficient of itself to produce practical results, and therefore, that it was necessary only to preach the right theory, and that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exhortation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was of very little importance.  But the reading of the inspired letters to the churches aroused us to the consciousness that in taking such ground we were contradicting the Holy Spirit. No one can read carefully the apostles' writings and not be impressed with the fact that a large portion of such writings are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exhortations to practical</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holy living.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Knowledge does not always produce obedience or all such exhortations would be in vain. We cannot resist the inference that the Holy Spirit does nothing in vain.  But we are not left to inference. Paul tells us of some who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;hold the truth in unrighteousness,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 1:18`,) which would be impossible if the view presented were correct. The wrath of God is revealed against the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ungodliness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unrighteousness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of such men.  &quot;Because that when they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knew</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they glorified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as God, neither were thankful.&quot; (`Ver. 21`.)  &quot;Wherefore God also gave them up to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">uncleanness.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Ver. 24`.)  If knowledge is righteousness Paul should not and would not have written as he did. The nature of the unrighteousness is apparent in the context.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">John gives us a definition of a righteous man which is worthy of our attention.  &quot;Little children let no man deceive you; he that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doeth righteousness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is righteous, even as he is righteous.&quot; `1 Jno. 3:7`.  &quot;In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil; whosoever </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doeth not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother.&quot; (`Ver. 10`.)  Who can fail to see that the object sought in giving men the truth, is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">character</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- to bring men into a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Godlike</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> condition, and that if men do not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obey</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the truth, and fail to realize and to express </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their lives, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all is vain.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R50 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obeyed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will prove the savor of life unto life, but disobeyed, the savor of death unto death.  Knowledge is power either for good or evil; and the greater one's knowledge the greater his responsibility.  &quot;To whom much is given much is required.&quot; &quot;This is the condemnation, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is come, and men loved darkness rather than light because </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their deeds</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">were evil.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If knowledge is righteousness, how could any man sin willfully after having come to the knowledge of the truth, and how could any human being be lost? for God has arranged that &quot;all men shall come to the knowledge of the truth,&quot; because he is the &quot;True light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.&quot;  We have the unmistakable testimony of Paul that though a man &quot;have the gift of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prophecy,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">understand all mysteries,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and though he have all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so that he could remove mountains, and have not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">charity (love),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he is nothing.&quot; `1 Cor. 13:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are referred to the statement of Paul: &quot;Abraham </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God and it was counted to him for righteousness,&quot; as proof that faith </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> righteousness. With this idea James is made to contradict Paul, for he says Abraham was justified by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not by faith only (`Ch. 2:24`); and John contradicts Paul when he tells us that &quot;all unrighteousness is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as we have seen already, that righteousness is doing right.  And Paul is even made to contradict himself in what we have quoted from him.  But these men do not contradict each other, and their harmony will be apparent when we remember that Paul commends the &quot;faith that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works by love.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Gal. 5:6`.  That Abraham's faith, and that of all other bible worthies was of this type --i.e. a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">working</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> faith--will be seen by reference to their history.  They were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by faith, when their faith led them to do what God required of them.  &quot;By faith Abel </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">offered sacrifice.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Heb. 11:2`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;By faith Noah...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prepared</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">an ark.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Ver. 7`).  &quot;By faith Abraham ...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obeyed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and went out&quot; &amp;c. (`Ver. 8`.)  &quot;By faith Abraham ...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">offered up Isaac.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Ver. 17`. They </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">acted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by faith, so says James of Abraham.  By works his faith was made perfect. `Ch. 2:22`.  The woman's faith saved her, but not till it led her to touch the Saviour.  It existed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> she was healed.  So we see that faith alone or separately considered does not save, and is not righteousness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have no doubt that the &quot;wedding garment&quot; is the &quot;fine linen, clean and white&quot; with which the Bride is clothed, and &quot;the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.&quot; `Rev. 19:8`.  But we can not believe that it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">limited</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to her </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">theology,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but that it must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">include</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> her </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">character.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It is the righteousness of her heart </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manifested</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in her life.  The garment </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">expresses</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> her condition--her loyalty, her purity and her fellowship with God.  Her righteousness is that to which she is called: &quot;God hath not called us to uncleanness, but to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holiness.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `1 Thess. 4:7`.  The garment expresses the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">effect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sought and gained, rather than the means God uses to bring it about.  &quot;This is the will of God even your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sanctification,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that ye should abstain from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fornication.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Ver. 3`.  To sanctify is to set apart for holy use, or to make holy or free from sin.  Merely to &quot;set apart&quot; for any purpose is not to sanctify.  &quot;Now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fruit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">holiness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the end everlasting life.&quot; `Rom. 6:22`.  &quot;Herein is my father glorified that ye bear much </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fruit.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me.&quot; &quot;If ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">keep my commandments</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ye shall abide in my love.&quot;  &quot;This is my</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R50 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">commandment, that ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love one another.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `John 15`.  &quot;He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.&quot; &quot;He that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">loveth not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> knoweth not God, for God is love.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The object of our union with Christ is to develop his life and love in us, and that by his spirit the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">deeds</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> might be mortified.&quot; `Rom. 8:13`.  A garment spotted with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shows that the carnal or fleshly nature is not wholly subdued. &quot;If ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if ye, through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If any one will take the trouble of examining the New Testament with the help of a concordance on this subject of purity, spotlessness, holiness and kindred ideas, they will be surprised that any one should even think of applying them to anything else than purity of heart and life. Get your theology corrected as fast as the truth is made plain to you, but do not let any one think that theology is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">garment.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We must be clothed with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">righteousness.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;He that hath clean hands and a pure heart&quot; shall ascend into the hill of the Lord. `Ps. 24:3,4`.  &quot;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.&quot;  The wedding garment is the divine nature developed and manifested.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That those who live late in the dispensation should have more light than those who lived further back in the shining path, is true, but the same overcoming of the flesh and loyalty to God was required of those who fell asleep as of us.  They were tested in their life, as are we and found the character which fitted them for the kingdom before they slept.  If a perfect theology were the wedding garment, then none but the last generation (even if they) could be the Bride.  But the Bride made ready evidently refers to the whole company, whether waking or sleeping who were in Christ Jesus and consecrated to God's will. He has become the author of eternal salvation to all them that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">obey</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him.&quot; This spirit of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">loyalty</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to Christ is one of the most essential qualities of a true disciple, or learner, and will be of great assistance to us all in perfecting our theology, and getting the victory over every element or characteristic of the beast.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If any should inquire of us what was the leading and controlling &quot;mark&quot; or quality of the beast, we would write in large letters: DOGMATISM AND INTOLERANCE. It is no proof that a doctrine is false because the Catholics believed it. Neither is it proof that a doctrine is true because a reformer, one whom God has used and led, promulgates it.  Let us beware what we receive from any one; and &quot;prove all things&quot; by the word of the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And above all may we be able to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">adorn</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our lives with holiness: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Add</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to faith,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> virtue; to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, CHARITY.  Last the greatest!  If we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">these,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we shall have the &quot;abundant entrance.&quot; `2 Pet. 1:5,11`.  To such the king will not say, &quot;Why camest thou in hither;&quot; but, &quot;Well done, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.&quot; Amen.                   J. H. P.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sons of God.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Have we ever fully realized what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God?  While the sons are being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfected,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is not expected that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will understand it, for it is declared that the world knoweth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not, because it knew </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not.  But it is expected of the professed &quot;followers of God as dear children&quot; to understand their relationship to the Father, and to receive instruction from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when he shall appear we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.&quot; `1 John 3:1,2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;As many as are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">led</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&quot; `Rom. 8:14`.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sons, waiting for the adoption--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sonship.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The relationship to God as sons, was little, if at all understood, prior to the advent of Jesus Christ in the flesh.  &quot;Now this I say, that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all; but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father; even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world; but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.  And because we are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.  Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.&quot; `Gal. 4:1,7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household--family--of God; and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into a holy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">temple</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Lord; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in whom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ye are also builded together for a habitation of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through the Spirit.&quot; `Eph. 2:19,22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We see then that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evidence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of sonship, is being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">led</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the Spirit; having the spirit of truth to guide us into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> truth, bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God; and if children, then </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heirs;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;heirs of God, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joint</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> heirs with Christ; if so be that we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him, that we may be also glorified together.&quot; `Rom. 8:16,17`.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Questions and Answers.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. If Christ laid down his natural life, to redeem the natural life of man I can see how Christ's death might benefit the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who are to be brought back in the natural or flesh-life, but how in that case could his death be any benefit to the Christian who is to be raised a spiritual body?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. As we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">counted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dead in Adam before we actually die so are we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">counted alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> again in Christ, before it is actually brought about. The object of counting the church redeemed now is that they may be on trial for eternal life, which they could not be if they were still counted dead.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The plan of God is to redeem from death first and bring to the knowledge of the truth afterward as has often been shown.  That is the rule, but with the church there is an exception.  As they get the knowledge before the time, for special reasons --that they may be developed as the Bride to assist the Husband in the future work--so they are dealt with as if they had already been redeemed.  An unredeemed man has nothing to give to, or use for the Lord.  All was lost in Adam.  But the Christian is always counted free from the claims of the Law and the Devil, in the word, hence he is expected to live for and use ALL for the Lord.  &quot;Ye are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (redeemed, ransomed) with a price, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are his.&quot;  We quote on this point a short extract from a letter of one who appreciates the value of Christ's death even to the Christian.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;If a man wished to bestow a title of honor and an inheritance on a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">slave,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would he not first make him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  How could a single soul be converted if not first </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">counted alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in God's sight? 'Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light.' Our freedom, so that we may choose eternal life, is based on the death of Christ.&quot; `Rom. 5:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ is both our ransom to redeem us, and our example of voluntary obedience.  He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consented</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the crucifixion.  &quot;Wherefore God hath highly exalted him&quot; &amp;c. `Phil. 2:9`, and if we by the same Spirit, &quot;crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts&quot; we like him will be raised</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R51 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">a spiritual body.  In the successful life--&quot;faithful unto death&quot; the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">object</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of redemption is attained. The world being raised in flesh will then have the flesh to crucify. Christian, you are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> enjoying the benefits of Christ's death, you are also made partaker of the Divine Nature by the Spirit.  &quot;Therefore ye are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">debtors,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not to, the flesh, for if ye live after the flesh ye shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">live.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  When the work begun in you is perfected, then &quot;mortality will be swallowed up in life.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Do you believe Christ came in the character of a Bridegroom at the beginning of both the Jewish and Gospel harvests?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. I do.  I understand that he came in that character at the beginning of the Jewish harvest as a part of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pattern,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and at the beginning of the gospel harvest as a parallel. `John 3:29`, is a clear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">statement</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fact</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in relation to the first.  The second depends on a number of evidences drawn from the prophetic periods and the parallelism of the Two Dispensations including the application of the parable of the &quot;Ten Virgins.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To deny that he came as Bridegroom at the beginning of the Gospel Harvest in 1874, is to ignore the proper parallelism between the thirty years of tarrying at each Advent.  He is revealed as both Bridegroom and Reaper in both harvests.  The first is the type--the second the antitype. He did </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> come at the first to be espoused to the gospel church and go away.  His espousal to the gospel church did not take place until the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, (the antitype of Eleazar, meeting Rebecca at the well where she received the bracelets and earrings--the &quot;Earnest&quot;) and all know that this was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">gone</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> away.  His ministry in the flesh was not to the sons but to the servants --the Jewish church.  &quot;I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&quot;  Hence his command: &quot;Go not in the way of the Gentiles,&quot; &amp;c.  It is true the natural seed in some sense belonged to God, but when Christ became a Son, God became a Father, and the Son </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represented</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his Father, hence &quot;He that receiveth me receiveth Him that sent me.&quot;  Christ's work in the flesh was to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">finish</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the work of God, with the typical seed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His coming as Bridegroom like all other features was a part of the pattern. Christ as his Father's representative could say: &quot;All mine are thine, and thine are mine and I am glorified in them.&quot; `Jno. 17:10`. This was of the disciples.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Though the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seed belonged to God, yet of Christ it is said: &quot;He came to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his own</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and his own received him not.&quot;  He came as Bridegroom and was rejected.  They were bidden but were found unworthy, hence the turning to the Gentiles-- &quot;the highways and hedges.&quot;  And </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">those</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> murderers he destroyed and burned up their city.  See `Matt. 22:1-14`. We hope all will continue to search carefully and prayerfully until they find the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true relation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> between the work of the Father and the Son. Truth is what we want.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Why do you not admit the distinction made by the Savior between the work of the Father and the Son? `Jno. 5:21,22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. We do admit the distinction if we understand what it is.  We have failed to express our thoughts correctly to any who suppose we make no distinction.  We will try again.  The coming of Jesus in the flesh, we regard as the dividing line between the two works referred to by the Saviour.  &quot;My Father worketh HITHERTO (i.e. before I came) and (now that I have come) I work.&quot; `V. 17`.  There is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sense</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in which all things were made by Him, as the Pre-existent One, but we do not find any scripture which speaks of Christ as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Son</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until the coming in the flesh, and that is the standpoint of Jesus when he used the above language.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;My Father worketh </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hitherto,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c., we use as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">key</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to unlock the rest. &quot;For as the Father (hitherto) raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, EVEN so the Son (now and henceforward) quickeneth whom he will,&quot; and the reason given is that the Father has given the work into his hands.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;All</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> things&quot; (`ver. 20`) which includes &quot;Judgment&quot; (`ver. 22`) and &quot;raising up the dead.&quot; (`ver. 21 and 29`.) The tense of the verb &quot;raiseth&quot; (`ver. 21`) is the same as &quot;worketh&quot; (`ver. 17`), and yet the</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Saviour puts it in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">past</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the word &quot;hitherto.&quot;  When Christ says: &quot;I work&quot; he does not mean that he does a work </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;distinct</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the Father,&quot; for he says: &quot;The Son can do nothing of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Himself&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`ver. 19`) and &quot;The Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the work.&quot;  Even of the work of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">judgment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> committed to Christ he says: &quot;I can of mine own self do </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nothing,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as I hear, I judge,&quot; &amp;c., (`ver. 30`.)  &quot;And if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not alone,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but I and the Father which sent me.&quot; `8:16`.  Before Jesus came, God did the work, but since the Son came the Father works by Him.  It is not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> true that God works by Christ since the resurrection than it was before.  If the Divine hidden </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was able to express itself in acts of power, surely the fully developed Son of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">should have</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> just what he claims, &quot;All power...in Heaven and Earth.&quot;  &quot;The Father judgeth no man,&quot; we must understand as teaching that he does not judge &quot;distinct from the Son&quot; for he had committed the work unto the Son--&quot;Immanuel.&quot;  We have already shown that Christ so taught, and Paul expresses the same thought; &quot;God hath appointed a day in the which HE will judge the world, by that man whom he hath ordained.&quot; &amp;c. `Acts 17:31`.  God judges, and yet Christ &quot;will judge the living AND THE DEAD at his appearing and kingdom.&quot; `2 Tim. 4:1`.  &quot;The Father judgeth no man&quot; and yet &quot;God (is) the Judge of all.&quot; `Heb. 12:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the prophecy of the invitation going to &quot;all the ends of the Earth&quot; God says: &quot;There is no God beside me; a just God and a Saviour, none beside me.&quot;  &quot;I am God....I have sworn by myself, that unto me every knee shall bow.&quot; `Isa. 45:21-23`, and yet God hath exalted Jesus and given </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Name at which all shall bow, and Christ is the Saviour. `Phil. 2:9,11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We trust in the living God who is the Saviour of all men, especially of those that believe.&quot;  Here Christ is not mentioned, shall we therefore conclude that God does it all &quot;as distinct from Christ?&quot; or shall we believe that Christ is the mediator by which God does the work?  God raises the dead, but Christ is his Agent, so to speak.  He will quicken the mortal bodies of his saints, but by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Christ in you.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Compare `Rom. 8:9,10,11`, where &quot;Spirit of God,&quot; &quot;Spirit of Christ&quot; and &quot;Christ in you&quot; are used interchangeably. The distinction Christ makes is between what was done before he came and since.  And we understand him to teach that since he came His work and the Father's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not distinct one from the other.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If any can not see it thus, we still pray for Heaven's blessing on you all.                     J. H. P.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Verbal Accuracy of God's Word.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Every word of God is pure--He is a shield to them that trust in Him--add thou not unto His words, lest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.&quot; `Prov. 30:5,6`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul sharply criticised some ignorant persons who came into the church indulging in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">strifes of words,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we frequently find misunderstandings and divisions caused solely by a lack of knowledge of the meaning of important words and phrases. In fact there are sects in the Christian world to-day, as we all know, who are cut off and separated from other parts of the body simply by a difference of opinion as to the exact meaning of perhaps a single word. The Psalmist said: &quot;He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?&quot;  Surely we can also say: He that made the tongue, and who gave us his law clothed in human language did he not know what words to select?  It is evident that the Holy Spirit inspired--not simply the broad ideas--but, in many cases at least, the exact phraseology.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So fully did the Jews believe this, that the penalty of death was imposed on the Scribe, who, in copying the law, dared to alter a single word.  So fully did Paul rest on the verbal accuracy of the Scriptures, that, relying on a single letter, he, at one bold stroke, cut away the main stay--so to speak--of the proud hopes of the whole Jewish nation.  A hope which had been cherished for ages; that they, and they alone, were the chosen seed of Abraham, and the heirs to all the promises.  Said he: &quot;Know you, certainly, that those of faith, these are the sons of Abraham.... Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, even for his SEED.  He does not say 'And to the SEEDS,' as concerning many, but as concerning one; 'and to thy SEED'--who is Christ. ...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">If ye are Christ's,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.&quot;*</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Only the knowledge of this fact, we think, could enable the Master to say so confidently, &quot;Till Heaven and Earth pass away, one iota [smallest letter in Greek alphabet] or one fine point [of a letter] shall not pass from the law till all be fulfilled.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That God's Word is perfect, is above controversy; we have indeed the oft repeated and divinely inspired assurance of the fact.  That our English translation is perfect, is by no means as certain; in fact, we have abundant proof to the contrary. The truth is, howsoever faithful or capable the scholar may be, it is still simply impossible to make of any extended portion of the Word a concise and perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">translation.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  For this reason: If each of the nations of earth possessed exactly the same sets of ideas, expressed in exactly the same manner, one word for each division of thought, the work of changing from one language to another would be comparatively easy. But, as we know, this is not the case. One Greek word may express a thought embodied in several English words, again, it may take a number of Greek words to cover all that is contained in a single English one. If words were made of India Rubber, they might be stretched as occasion required; and indeed, there are those who so use them; but they are really more like a piece of hardened steel; which, while it may have different shapes, as viewed from different sides, is still unyielding and unchanging.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is sometimes expedient in composing to use synonymous words when no change of sense is intended, in order to avoid repetition; but if this be done in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">translating,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is likely to cause--if not obscurity-- at least doubt and uncertainty.  But the translators of our version of the Bible did this very thing, and willingly acknowledge it.  In the preface they say: &quot;We have not tied ourselves to an uniformity of phrasing or to an identity of words.... That we should express the same notion in the same particular word, as for example, if we translate the Hebrew or Greek word by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">purpose,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> never to call it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">intent,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It had been better many times that they had been more strictly literal, even to the charge of producing a monotonous repetition. Our modern taste, we know, prefers a change in the sound, but we sometimes lose in force and power in obtaining that object.  Paul was peculiarly fond of repetition.  He is sometimes, as Paley says: &quot;off at a word.&quot;  When he strikes an expression that pleases him, he--like a child with a sweet butternut--turns it over and over, picking out at each fresh position some dainty bit, and refusing apparently, to lay it down until the last rich morsel has been extracted.  We have a specimen in `2 Cor. 1`.  &quot;Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comforteth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them which are in any trouble, by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wherewith we ourselves are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comforted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God.&quot;  Here our translators tired of the repetition.  Not so Paul.  He had not yet extracted all the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> out of the blessed word, and so he</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R52 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">goes on thus: &quot;For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> also abounded through Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and salvation... or whether we be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comforted,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is for your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and salvation,... knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comfort.&quot;*</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some original words have been translated by so many English ones, and the rendition has been in certain cases so arbitrary, that there is blind confusion and an utter failure to perceive the true import of the Divine Word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are not fault finding.  The translators of King James' version, so called, probably did the very best they could under the circumstances. We of 1879 are living more than a quarter of a Millennium nearer the perfect day.  Indeed we fully believe that that perfect day is already dawning upon us.  We have light, let us have truth.  Truth at any price.  Truth, if it overthrows long cherished errors.  Truth, if it sweeps away musty cobwebs, once gossamer filaments of fancy, enshrined in our hearts.  Truth, if the heavens fall: but they cannot fall, they rest on truth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let not a superstitious reverence for the old, take the place of a holy veneration for the pure, although it may seem to be new.  Error may be old: TRUTH IS ETERNAL.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LIFE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bible student is often puled with the question, How many kinds of life are there; and what is the difference between them?  Our authorized version answers the question vaguely, if at all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as found in the New Testament, is, in most places, a translation from one of the two Greek words, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Psuchee.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The rendering of both by the one English word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> covers up a clean-cut difference of meaning between the two.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has several significations. When it refers to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and is so translated in our New Testament, it invariably alludes to the natural, fleshly, or blood-life.  Liddell and Scott, in their lexicon, give the meaning as follows: &quot;Psuchee, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">breath;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Latin, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anima--life--spirit.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It leaves the body with the blood.  Periphr for the man himself.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of animals, &amp;c.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> refers generally, in the New Testament, to the spiritual life, either in this age, or after the resurrection. Liddell and Scott give, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zoee, a living,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e., means of life; life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> opposed to death.  It sometimes, at least, as in the definition, &quot;means of life,&quot; seems to indicate an inherent or independent life power; thus opposed to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is dependant on the breath.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the New Testament, we find </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternal,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">everlasting,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(zoee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> over forty times.  Also, endless </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> word of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> book of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> water of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> crown of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c.  Also, our Lord is called the Prince of Life; Author of Life; Bread of Life, &amp;c.--All from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Psuchee is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> found in any such connection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In reference to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and its corresponding Hebrew word, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nephesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an able critic remarks: &quot;Perhaps it may be worthy of notice, that in all the seven hundred times in which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nephesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occurs, and the one hundred and five times of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not once is the word immortal, or deathless, or never-dying, found in connection, as qualifying the terms.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We will quote as samples the occurrences of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wherever translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in Matthew: &quot;They are dead who sought the child's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;Take not thought for your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> what ye shall eat;&quot; &quot;He that finds his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall lose it, and he that loses his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for my sake, shall find it;&quot; &quot;For whoever will save his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall lose it; and whoever may lose his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for my sake, shall find it.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These last two passages are made still clearer by `John 12:25`, where, apparently, the complete remark of Christ is given, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are brought into direct contrast: &quot;He that loves his life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psuchee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall lose it; and he that hates his life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psuchee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in this world, shall keep it unto life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(zoee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> eternal.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We reserve last occurrence of life --from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--in Matthew, for the present.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are never taught to hate the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to be held in comparatively low estimation.  For instance: &quot;If anyone comes to me and hates not his father,...and even his own life&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psuchee),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c. Barnabas and Paul were called &quot;men who have hazarded their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lives</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the name of Jesus.&quot;  Paul said, &quot;neither do I count my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dear to myself&quot; &amp;c.  When Eutychus fell from the third loft during Paul's preaching, and was taken up insensible, the apostle said: &quot;His life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psuchee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is in him.&quot;  It is applied to beasts: &quot;The third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psuchee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> died.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We will look at a few passages in which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occurs.  &quot;Straight is the gate, and narrow the way, which leads to life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(zoee).&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;If thou desirest to enter into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> keep the commandments.&quot; &quot;He that believes on the Son has everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and he that believes not the Son shall not see </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Ye will not come to me, that ye may have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In `John, chapters 5` and `6`, every occurrence of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From Psuchee we obtain the adjective, Psuchikos; which occurs six times in the New Testament, is twice translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sensual,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and four times </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as follows:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him.&quot;  It is sown a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body, it rises a spiritual body.  If there is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body, there is also a spiritual...but the spiritual is not first, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (psuchikos) and afterward the spiritual.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In perfect harmony with this last scripture we find in relation to the two Adams, the corresponding heads of the natural and spiritual planes: &quot;The first man Adam was made a living psukeen (natural man); the last Adam a life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(zoee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> giving Spirit.&quot; We have probably quoted sufficient to render clear the distinction between the two Spirit inspired words, let us now look at their force and bearing on the question of the atonement, which has been agitating our people lately.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been asserted that the life which Christ laid down for the world was not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but that which he had with the Father; which-- spiritual life--he laid down at his incarnation and took up at his resurrection; Wresting `John 6:63`.  &quot;The flesh profits nothing,&quot; from its true position, the sacrificial death of Christ has been degraded, and the blood of the covenant counted an unholy [Greek </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">koinon,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> common] thing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The original Greek settles the question of the kind of life, clearly and unmistakably.  While it is continually taught that in Christ we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> everlasting, it nowhere says that he laid down his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for us.  On the contrary it plainly and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">invariably</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> states that the life he gave was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [natural, or blood life.]  We will quote a few texts.  &quot;The son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (psuchee) a ransom for many.&quot; `Matt. 20:28`, `Mark 10:45`. &quot;The good Shepherd lays down his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the sheep.&quot; `John 10:11`.  This declaration is stronger when we notice that in the `verse previous` Christ says, &quot;I came that they may have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c.  Following, he reiterates &quot;I lay down my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the sheep....For this my Father loves me, because I lay down my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that I may receive </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(a)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it again, no one forces </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(b)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it from me, but I lay it down of myself.  I have authority </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(c)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This commandment I received from my Father.&quot;  Although Christ here speaks of receiving it again, it does not of necessity mean that when he rose from the dead he took again the blood life.  Simply, he had authority, or an arrangement with the Father to live again.  The nature of his resurrection life we learn from other scriptures.  The passage in this respect is similar to `John 12:25`.  &quot;He that hates his psuchee in this world, shall keep </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> eternal: when mortality shall be swallowed up by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have a strong contrast in the following.  &quot;We know that we have passed out of death into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because we love the brethren.  He that loves not his brother </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">abides in death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [During the enjoyment of the blood life (psukee,) mankind are under the dominion of death.]...In this we know love, that he laid down his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for us; and we ought to lay down our lives </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psukas)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the brethren.&quot; &quot;Greater love hath no one than this, that one lay down his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for his friends.&quot;  No one is ever supposed to lay down the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What each of his lives (psuchee and zoee) do for us we have in `Rom. 5:10`. &quot;For if being enemies, we were reconciled to God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his Son, [the laying down of the blood life or psuchee] much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved [by the impartation of his spiritual nature, and the benefits that follow,] by his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  As to the origin of this higher life, and how it comes to us we have `John 5:26`, &quot;As the Father has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in himself, so he gave also to the Son to have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in himself.&quot;  &quot;For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c.  By the arrangement above noted, Jesus our Lord has become &quot;Author of zoee,&quot; &quot;Prince of zoee,&quot; &quot;Bread of zoee,&quot; and mark it, &quot;The resurrection and the zoee.&quot;  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to all, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to believers.  &quot;Marvel not at this; for an hour is coming, in which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that are in the graves shall hear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">voice,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and shall come forth; they that did good, to the resurrection of life (zoee,) and they that did evil, to the resurrection of judgment.&quot;-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Am. Bible Union Version.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;These are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ (anointed,) the Son of God, and that believing ye may have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his name.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Remarks by the Editor.  This is very satisfactory and we think should and will, end controversy as to what life Jesus gave for our ransom from death. Our natural life </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(psuchee)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is forfeited.  Our Lord became our substitute and gave his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for ours and then </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as a gift</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> offers believers his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zoee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> eternal.</font><br />
