<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Antichrist.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`2 THESS. 2`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B.--Good evening, brother A., I have wanted for some time to inquire your views of the &quot;Man of Sin&quot;--&quot;The Antichrist.&quot;  Who is he, what is he, and when will he come; or has he already come?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A.--I shall enjoy a conversation with you on this subject; it is one deserving of careful thought and is mentioned by Jesus himself, as well as by his apostles and prophets.  I presume I need not make mention of the various theories held by bible students on the subject.  Many believe that Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt soon, and that some literal man will oppose and exalt himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he, as God, will sit in the temple of God showing himself that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is God. (`2 Thes. 2:4`.)  He is expected to be able to perform </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;signs and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lying wonders&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--to deceive all the world into the idea that HE is God, and to have them give homage and worship to him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are various conjectures as to who may be this &quot;Man of Sin.&quot; It has been claimed for Napoleon Boneparte and each of his successors to the title to the throne of France, and now for Prince Jerome Boneparte.  Others quite recently have given up expecting so much of a development of power from a broken down dynasty, and claim, with positiveness, that it is the present Pope.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B.--It would be a very remarkable thing to have occur in this nineteenth century.  It might have been possible in some heathen land, hundreds of years ago, but I could not make myself believe that such things are even possible now.  No, the tendency of the press and of science is to ignore God altogether, and in the face of the wonderful evidences of His creative power and might, to deny, entirely, the Lord, in whose praise &quot;Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. `Ps. 19:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A.--I fully agree with you.  It would be much easier to turn the world to Atheism than to Idolatry. This is one reason why I could not look for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">personal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;Man of Sin.&quot; Paul had always exhorted the church to look and wait for &quot;The day of the Lord, yet here (`2 Thes. 2`.) he tells them &quot;That day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that Man of Sin be revealed.&quot; As I believe the word to teach that we are now living in &quot;the day of the Lord,&quot; you see it is both natural and consistent in me to look back for the &quot;Man of Sin,&quot; and to expect to be able to recognize him, for Paul says he must be revealed, or his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real character</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shown and seen before the &quot;day of the Lord.&quot;  He referred to a false system which would develop in the church.  As one error after another crept into the church, they gradually brought about the &quot;falling away.&quot;  The church fell from her position of trust in, and support on the promises of her absent Lord, and began to love the world and the things of the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The narrow path was too steep and rough; she coveted the world's ease and abundance, and the more bold element formed the plan of so arranging the customs and laws, that the world's affections were captured, and instead of persecuting, the Roman Empire embraced the church and seated her in power.  Doubtless she thought to use the power and influence of her new friend--Rome --to the honor of the Lord to whom she was betrothed, but soon she began to &quot;glorify herself and to live deliciously with the kings of the earth,&quot; and &quot;her sins reached unto heaven.&quot; `Rev. 18:5-7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. You speak of it as the woman, &amp;c.; if this is the same referred to by Paul, why does he call it &quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Sin?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. It requires </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to make </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as Adam and Eve became </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;God called their name Adam.&quot; And as Jesus and his bride are to become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and together be known as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (anointed)--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--so with this case: The virgin of Christ became untied to the World--They twain became </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- &quot;The Man of Sin.&quot;  Since she pretended to be the true bride and heir with Jesus to the throne of kingdoms, so when united to the World, she claimed the union to be valid and lawful, that she </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sat a queen.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> She ruled over the empire of earth, claiming the various titles and honors due to the true Lord and his bride.  And that system--Papacy --being a falsifier which sought to take the honor of the true anointed, is emphatically the opponent of the true Christ, or, as the name signifies, Antichrist.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. But, can we say the Papacy denies God or Christ?  Is the language --&quot;Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped,&quot;--applicable to that system?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. Yes; as Paul said of some: &quot;They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him.&quot;  I refer to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Papal system;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not to individual Roman Catholics.  If you are not familiar with</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE CLAIMS OF PAPACY,</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">you cannot so well understand how it exalts itself, and opposes God. Papacy claims that its representative, the Pope, is &quot;King of Kings and Lord of Lords,&quot;--&quot;The Prince of the kings of the earth.&quot;  As Christ's vice-gerent, he is the Pa-pa --Pope--Father, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;The Everlasting Father,&quot; &quot;The Prince of peace,&quot; &quot;The Mighty God.&quot;  All of these, and every other title announced by the Prophets, is considered as proper and applicable to the Pope, since </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he is Christ's vicar,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">instead of Christ.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Did the prophets declare the reign of Christ for a thousand years over the nations, and that he should reign until he should put all enemies under him? Papacy claims that when exalted to power, it did put down all enemies, and that for a thousand years it did reign over the kings of the earth. (Generally dated, I believe, from A.D. 792 to 1792.)  And they claim that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">millennial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reign of Christ and his saints, of `Rev. 20`, took place, is now in the past, and that the period since the overthrow of Papacy's dominion (1798) is the &quot;little season,&quot; mentioned in `vs. 3,7 and 8`, during which the &quot;Devil is loosed.&quot;  (Protestantism and all infidelity to the church.)  During her reign over the earth's kings, she did &quot;Rule with a rod of iron,&quot; and claimed Divine authority, and that it was the fulfilment of `Psa. 2:6-12`. Read it.  To `vs. 10-12` were given emphasis, especially &quot;Kiss the SON.&quot; Actually the Kings of the earth did kneel down before the Pope, kiss his great toe, receive his blessing and their crowns from his hands. (Sometimes the crown was placed by the Pope's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">feet</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon king's heads.)  And for centuries no king reigned in Europe without this blessing and appointment of the Pope.  To offend or disobey was to forfeit their titles and thrones.  Thus, by claiming God's honor, Papacy exalted itself and opposed the true God.  To illustrate the claims of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Papacy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> let me quote a few of its &quot;great swelling words.&quot;--Pope Martin: &quot;The greatness of priesthood began in Melchisedec, was solemnized in Aaron, continued in the children of Aaron, perfectionated in Christ, represented in Peter, exalted in the universal jurisdiction, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manifested in the Pope.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  So that, through this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pre-eminence of my priesthood,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> having all things subject to me, it may seem well verified in me, that was spoken of Christ, 'Thou hast subdued all things under his feet.'...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> am all in all and above all, so that God Himself, and I, the vicar of God, have both one consistory. ...Wherefore, if those things that I do be said not to be done of man but of God: WHAT CAN YOU MAKE OF ME BUT GOD?  Again, if prelates of the church be called and counted of Constantine for Gods, I then, being above all prelates, seem by this reason to be ABOVE ALL GODS.  Wherefore, no marvel if it be in my power to</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R54 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">change time and times, to alter and abrogate laws, to dispense with all things, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yea, with the precepts of Christ.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Pope Gregory II. boasted that: &quot;All the kings of the West reverence the Pope as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God on earth.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  An oft accepted title was, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Our Lord God the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pope.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  At the Lateran Council the Pope was addressed: &quot;Thou art another God on earth.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. It would appear that in olden times the Popes had made great pretensions.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. Yes, brother; and you will remember that the late Pious IX. promulgated the dogma of his own </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Infallibility.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And the present Pope, &quot;Leo XIII. claims to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Lion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of the tribe of Judah.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This, like other titles belonging to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ, is claimed by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anti-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ, as you will see by this extract from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pittsburg Dispatch</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of June 14, 1879: &quot;A rich American, now residing at Rome, desiring to possess the bust of Leo XIII., engaged the services of the celebrated sculptor, Tadolini. The latter, not content with the simple portrait of the Holy Father, went to the Vatican and asked permission of Leo XIII. to reproduce his features from the original.  The Pope consented.  When the work was finished, Leo congratulated the artist, who asked him to trace a word on the still fresh clay.  His Holiness took the burin from the sculptor, and wrote with a smile, 'Leo de tribu juda.'&quot;  [&quot;The Lion of the tribe of Judah.&quot;]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. It does seem very clear when so put together; but how about the `remainder of the verse`,--&quot;Who sitteth in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">temple</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, showing himself that he is God.&quot;  How could Papacy fulfill this?  The temple at Jerusalem had been destroyed hundreds of years before Papacy's rule.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. The temple of God is the dwelling or abode of God.  Once He dwelt in the Jewish temple, but at the death of Jesus the vail of the temple was rent in twain and the glory of the Lord departed, and from that time it ceased to be, really, the temple of God.  For</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R55 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">fifty days there was no temple on earth; but, &quot;When </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pentecost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was fully come,&quot; the Lord descended by his spirit, and his glory and presence filled </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">His New Temple,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the gospel church.  &quot;Know ye not that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are the temple of God?&quot; `1 Cor. 3:16`; `Eph. 2:21,22`.  There has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">other temple</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> since, and there never will be another, for this one is an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">everlasting habitation.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Any building which men may put up at Jerusalem might be called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> temple, but it would not be THE </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">temple of God.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The &quot;Man of Sin,&quot;--Papacy--did take his seat in God's church (temple), and used in a blasphemous manner the titles and honors of the &quot;King of Kings.&quot;  Paul tells us that the errors which led to this falling away from the truth had begun to operate in the church even in his day.  It increased more rapidly when the churches' &quot;candlestick&quot; was removed,--the special gifts of the Spirit in healing, discerning of spirits, etc., ceased. These let, or hindered the more rapid development of error in the Apostolic days.  (Another hindrance was the pagan empire, and not until its decline could Papacy be exalted.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. It does seem to be a wonderful counterfeit of the true Kingdom of God, and I see some force in the Spirit's calling it (`vs. 11`) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">strong delusion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that they should believe a lie.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. We find a clearly drawn</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Picture of the Counterfeit of God's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kingdom. (`Rev. 12`.)</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. This chapter is quite peculiar, and is generally thought to be a picture of the establishment of the true kingdom.  However, this view involves a contradiction.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. It does, and for this reason it has been considered one of the most difficult chapters of this difficult book.  Let us examine carefully:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Woman, clothed with the Sun,&quot; is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gospel church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> covered with the precious promises of God and the glorious light of truth. The Moon is the reflection of the Sun's brightness, so the Law or Jewish age was a shadow of the Gospel.  It was light, but not the real, only reflected light.  The woman had the Moon under her feet.  She had reached a higher plane, and yet she rested upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.  The diadem of twelve stars, representing the Apostles (`vs. 3`). The Roman Empire having seven heads (Rome's seven successive and distinct </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forms of government),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and ten horns (divisions of power).  &quot;The red dragon,&quot; Pagan Rome, persecuted the church.  &quot;His tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth.&quot;  &quot;Stars of heaven,&quot;--the bright ones or ministers and teachers in the church.  The dragon's tail draws them, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> these become followers of Pagan Rome in hopes of having favor with the empire and escaping persecution.  As a result, they lose their position as stars in the true church, and are &quot;cast to the earth.&quot;  Persecuted and reviled, she was pained to be delivered, and longed for the completion of the promised &quot;Seed of the woman which should bruise the serpent's head.&quot;  Her anxiety and desire in this direction produced a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pre-mature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> birth--&quot;The Man of Sin&quot; (the papal hierarchy) being the offspring. This &quot;male child,&quot; at first a weak one (A.D. 314), was gradually &quot;caught up unto God and to his throne,&quot; or exalted to the position and titles, homage and praise of the true &quot;seed,&quot; so that &quot;He as God sat in the temple (church) of God, showing himself that he is God.&quot;  And within three hundred years he did &quot;Rule the nations with a rod of iron.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Vs. 7`: &quot;And there was war in heaven;&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there was a conflict or controversy between the two elements --the church and the empire --when this son of the church attempted to take the ruling position. (This conflict and casting down continued for several hundred years, or until about A.D. 752, when &quot;In the pontificate of Zachary, the German court decided that no Metropolitan could enter upon his functions without the approval of the pontiff.&quot;  &quot;In the same year, Pepin asked the sanction of the Pope to ascend the throne of France.&quot;) &quot;Michael and his angels&quot;--the papacy and its supporters--fought against the dragon--pagan rulers, etc.,-- and the great dragon was cast out of heaven.  This conflict between Papal and Pagan power resulted, as we have seen, in the overthrow of the latter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. But does it not seem a forced construction to suppose Michael to symbolize the &quot;Man of Sin?&quot;  Is not this the same Michael referred to in `Dan. 12`?  If it is a symbol in one case, is it not in the other?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. No; the account in `Dan. 12` is a literal statement.  The resurrection and other matters there mentioned are literal, but not so `Rev. 12`. The woman, dragon, tail, stars, horns, etc., are all symbols, and it would be out of order to have a real Michael fight a symbolic dragon. However, it seemed puling at first to know why this name should be given to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Antichrist,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but on turning to a dictionary we find that the meaning of the word Michael is-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Who as God.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It is quite remarkable that the meaning should be in such close accord with Paul's description --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He as God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sitteth in the temple of God,&quot; etc.  When the dragon was cast out of heaven (out of the ruling position) it left this one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(&quot;Who as God,&quot;)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in control, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the heavens,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and from him issues the &quot;loud voice&quot; (great proclamation) of `verses 10,11 and 12`; that is, Papacy claimed that when it assumed control &quot;the kingdom of God and the power of his anointed,&quot; had come to the world. They claimed that they had overcome by the blood of the Lamb, their lives and testimonies.  &quot;Therefore, rejoice ye heavens.&quot;  (Let Papacy and all connected therewith rejoice.)  &quot;Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, etc.&quot;  As the church had once been persecuted when Paganism reigned, so now when she reigns she makes the Pagans and heretics suffer.  This, papacy claims as the millennium, during which it broke in pieces the kingdoms with the rod of iron.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">B. But it is the dragon that causes the woe, not the church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A. Remember that the dragon represents Rome, and that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dragon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has various heads.  (See `Rev. 17`.)  Here it had fully taken on its fifth head--Papacy.  It was the same Rome under a new ruler, or head, and the same power which had previously persecuted the church,--the Empire and its army. Under the new ruler it persecuted pagans and heretics.  Remember, therefore, that hereafter the dragon represents the empire or military power, under the control of its ecclesiastical head.  This military power must be made use of by its new head, and its force was directed against the woman and against the remnant of her seed [not of the apostasy], which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">keep the commandments</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and have the testimony of Jesus.&quot;  [&quot;The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&quot;] These, Waldenses, &amp;c., doubtless knew from the prophetic word, not only that the &quot;same Jesus&quot; would come again &quot;to be glorified in his saints,&quot; but also that there should &quot;first come a great falling away,&quot; and &quot;That Man of Sin be revealed --the son of perdition,&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the day of the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Vs. 14`.--To the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness [lit., the place deserted] into her place. The two wings are probably the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;two witnesses,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the word,--which now showed the true church from which papacy had sprung, her true condition--ON </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instead of, as at first, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">above</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the earth, with the moon under her feet.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These two witnesses assist her, not only to mount upward again, but to return to &quot;the place deserted,&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to a condition of harmony with God, not with the world.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Building of Zion.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.&quot; `Psalm 102:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have no doubt that Zion as used in scripture is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">double,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> aside from its being the name of a literal mountain.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It represents &quot;the city of the Lord&quot; (`Isa. 60:14`)--Jerusalem. But which?  There are two Jerusalems: the old, and the new: the earthly and the heavenly, and two nations or churches corresponding-- the Jewish and the Gospel.  Some apply the text wholly to the restoration of the earthly Jerusalem, and others apply it wholly to the success, in some way of the gospel church; perhaps it is most commonly applied to what is familiarly called a &quot;revival of religion.&quot;  We believe such prophecies apply </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">primarily</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the building up of the old Jerusalem, by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restoration,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and in a higher sense, to the building up of the New Jerusalem by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glorification,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that both will be accomplished in one and the same day, i.e. &quot;the day of wrath,&quot; or the 37 years on which we have entered reaching to A.D. 1914.  We do not believe that a revival of religion fills the prophetic picture in any proper sense.  The New Testament clearly locates the appearing in glory after the resurrection of the saints, for, says Paul: &quot;When Christ who is our life shall appear we also shall appear with him in glory.&quot; `Col. 3:4`. That it is associated with the Christian's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reward,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not with his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work in this life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is evident, because Peter speaks of our trial when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ended</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as being &quot;found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.&quot; `1 Pet. 1:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;manifestation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the sons of God,&quot; (`Rom. 8:19`) the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">appearing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in glory, and the descent of the New Jerusalem, may be the same great fact under different names.  The same glorious results are clearly foretold as coming from each.  When the New Jerusalem comes down &quot;having the glory of the Lord,&quot; it is said &quot;The nations shall walk in the light of it;&quot; to its flowing river &quot;whosoever will&quot; are invited to come and drink, and the leaves of its tree are &quot;for the healing of the nations.&quot; `Rev. 21:10,11,24` and `22:1,2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a result of the &quot;manifestation of the sons of God,&quot; it is said that &quot;the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.&quot; `Rom. 8:21`.  Compare these results with what is stated in the connection of our text as to the great benefits to earth's inhabitants, of the Lord's appearing in glory, and two things must, we think, be impressed on the reader's mind: first, that the three things mentioned above are one and the same; second, that the appearing in glory is an event greatly to be desired for the benefit of mankind.  Certainly the manifestation, or descent, are not due until after the church is glorified, hence the building up of Zion must precede the time when a perfect theology will prevail among men on earth.  It is when the &quot;Lord shall bring again Zion&quot; that &quot;the watchmen shall see eye to eye.&quot; Then, the veil being removed the knowledge of the Lord shall prevail,&quot; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.&quot; `Isa. 52`. It is during a period of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imperfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> theology, when we know only in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">part,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the stones of the heavenly building are selected and hewn to fit their places; but when the temple is built and filled with the glory of the Lord, &quot;Then it will shine forth as the sun, and the nations will be enlightened, and they shall turn to the Lord.&quot; `Ps. 22:27`.  Some object to the double application of the term Zion, who are believers in the restoration of the earthly Jerusalem, and yet believe in the same general results as to the world's conversion in the dispensation to come.  They believe that the Jew restored will be God's agency in the great work.  To this we agree, and with them we would quote: &quot;It shall come to pass in that day that ten men shall lay hold of one that is a Jew and say, we will go with you, for we have heard that the Lord is with you.&quot; That the earthly Jerusalem restored is to be capital of the earthly nations, and center of earthly service, does not as we see it, militate against the idea that the New Jerusalem in glory, will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> manifested through restored Jerusalem. Satan's invisible kingdom has acted largely through the visible city and government of Rome, and by the same law of correspondence, the Roman Empire, the Beast with seven heads and ten horns, is &quot;called the Devil and Satan.&quot; `Rev. 12:3,9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In this sense we believe the restored Jerusalem will be called the kingdom of God, but the real, the heavenly kingdom will be as much higher than the earthly, as Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> higher than he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The Jews restored will be natural men, bearing the image of the Earthly, and such can neither see nor inherit the real kingdom of God. `John 3:3`, and `1 Cor. 15:44,50`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That not only the earthly Jerusalem is called Zion, but also the Heavenly is evident, from `Heb. 12:18,22`: &quot;Ye are not come to the mount that might be touched... but ye are come to Mt. Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem.&quot;  A </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">literal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mountain could be touched and stands associated with literal or earthly things.  The earthly is but a symbol of the Heavenly, which is therefore called a mount which could not be touched.  None we think can object to the double application, who see that in God's plan nearly every thing is double; the two standing related to each other as the natural and the spiritual.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two Adams, their two wives, and two families; two births and two lives; two covenants, two laws, two sanctuaries, two circumcisions, two temples, two seeds, two nations and two lands for inheritance. Abraham, to whom the promise was made, saw through the earthly, and so looked for a &quot;better country, that is, an heavenly,&quot; (`Heb. 11:16`) and so also he looked for a &quot;city whose builder and maker is God.&quot; (`Ver. 10`.)  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could build an earthly city, but not the heavenly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">build up Zion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> implies a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">process,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and so far as relates to the earthly Jerusalem, includes the restoration of the Jewish nation of Israel according to the flesh, in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all its parts;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we believe in its application to the Gospel church, the same must be true.  That from 1878 to 1914 is the last half of the last trump, has often been shown, and also that this is the period during which Jerusalem is to be restored.  &quot;The last, or seventh trumpet covers the day of wrath, angry nations and the time of reward for prophets, saints and them that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fear God's name, small and great.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rev. 11:18`.  All Christians, whatever their grade of development, are thus included.  Some occupy a position with Christ in his throne, as a reward of their faithfulness, while many serve him before the throne. But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are included in the heavenly city, and that city descending in its completeness and glory; as the light of the nations, is called the Bride, the Lamb's wife.  As the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jewish church was the Bride in type, so the antitype includes the whole gospel church.  This does not shut out the idea of order and variety in the city of God, nor lessen the motive of seeking by faithfulness a high position, even a place in the throne, but it does preserve the idea so clearly taught in the New Testament, of the Unity and indivisibility of the One Body of Christ.  Some are to be counted worthy to escape the tribulation, as like Aaron in the mount</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R57 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">with Moses, execute the judgments written, while others are left to pass through the fire, wash their robes, and come up out of the great tribulation. But as the body would not be complete without </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> its members, so the church or city of God would be incomplete without its citizens, as servants before the throne.  &quot;They shall be mine saith the Lord </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in that</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when I </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">make up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my jewels.&quot; Even them that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">think</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on his name are dear in the sight of the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The day of this building is here and both the earthly and heavenly will be built up.  Then indeed the Lord in his temple will appear in his glory, and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.                  J. H. P.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Joseph and Christ.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The history of Joseph the son of Jacob, as given in the book of `Genesis`, is one of considerable interest. Taken just as a true story of a life, there are but few like it.  &quot;Truth is stranger than fiction;&quot; and it is certain that many, both young and old, have read this history with thrilling interest and lasting profit.  The exemplary conduct of Joseph is worthy of admiration and imitation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His relation to the history of God's cause and people, in their early stage of development, is important. As an example of the over-ruling Providence of God in the affairs of men and nations, showing how man, seeking his own selfish ends, and to a certain degree succeeding, may yet have his plans thwarted, and the seeming evil turned to good account, the history of Joseph is most remarkable.  For many reasons his history has been justly valued by</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R57 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">many; but to us the most important feature of his case is its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">allegorical</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> character.  This feature of bible history, though overlooked by many, and denied by some, is becoming more and more apparent.  The story itself, though true, as we fully believe, sinks into comparative insignificance when its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> import is seen.  The greater eclipses the less, and the spiritual is greater than the natural, but while this is true, there can be no doubt that those who appreciate the spiritual, value the letter, because of its deeper import, even more than those who see only the letter; just as men who expect to be changed from the natural to the spiritual body in due time, value the natural body because it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a stepping stone to the higher, more than do they who ignore the spiritual, and who act on the epicurean principle: &quot;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.&quot;  We regard Joseph's history as representing in its general features the life and work of our Lord Jesus Christ.  In a type proper, as in the law, we would expect &quot;every jot and tittle&quot; of it to be fulfilled, but in an allegory we look for a picture only on general principles.  The case of Abraham's two wives, and their sons, Isaac and Ishmael, which is declared to be &quot;an allegory,&quot; (`Gal. 4`) will illustrate. Every feature of their lives is not mentioned, but there is a most remarkable correspondence between the facts in their history, and the facts in relation to the two Jerusalems; to which Paul makes the application. We do not intend to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">make</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> parallels, or to force into use any feature of Joseph's life, and say this and that must have a parallel; but using as a basis what is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">revealed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ elsewhere, we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">find</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the parallels, and by these, as illustrations, confirm the truth.  We regard these correspondences as strong evidence that the same mind that created the gospel plan, superintended the lives of the ones of whom the history is given, and inspired in his own way the writers.  The evidence seems all the stronger in view of the fact that many features of this correspondence have not long been seen.  They have been hidden away as jewels in the earth, to be uncovered for the encouragement of the faith of the disciple in this hour of bold and defiant infidelity.  &quot;He that hath ears to hear let him hear.&quot;  It seems as if no Christian could have any difficulty in tracing the many features of our Saviour's life and work in the life of Joseph, when their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">attention</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is called to them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Joseph was the well beloved son of his father: &quot;Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,&quot; `Gen. 37:3`. For this fact, his reproving of sin, and for his ambitious dreams of coming glory, his brethren hated him.  So Jesus, the &quot;beloved Son&quot; of his Father, on account of his condemning their wickedness, and because of his royal claims, as one born to be their king, was hated by his brethren--the Jews.  The words are almost identical.  &quot;Shalt thou indeed reign over us?&quot; said Joseph's brethren, when he had told them of his dream of their sheaves making obeisance to his sheaf.&quot;  &quot;We will not have this man to reign over us;&quot; We have no king but Caesar;&quot; said Jesus' brethren.  In both cases the malice became so intense that death was determined on.  They both went down into the pit, and were both delivered from death.  It is true Joseph did not actually die, but neither did Isaac, who in another case prefigured Christ, and it is said &quot;Abraham offered his son Isaac,&quot; and also &quot;Received him from the dead in figure.&quot;  The pit was a figure of the death state into which Christ descended.  Joseph was counted dead, and his resurrection was thus in figure; but Christ's death and resurrection were both in fact.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The events do not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occur in the same order in both cases; but both were severely tempted and yet resisted; both occupied for a time the position of a servant, and were shamefully abused; both were favored of God in their sufferings and their cause miraculously vindicated; both had a price set upon them by their enemies in certain &quot;pieces of silver;&quot; and both gained a glorious victory, being exalted to the &quot;right hand of power.&quot;  Pharaoh committed all power of his kingdom into Joseph's hand: &quot;Thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.&quot; `Gen. 41:40`. He was royally robed and enthroned, and before him went the cry &quot;Bow the knee.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What Pharaoh did thenceforward was done through Joseph, and the only way to obtain the blessing of Egypt was by the &quot;way&quot; or mediation of Joseph.  So Christ was exalted to the right hand of God; &quot;sat down with the Father in his throne;&quot; had all power given unto him in heaven and earth; &quot;that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow;&quot; and it is said of him, &quot;Let all the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">angels</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God worship him.&quot; &quot;He is Lord of all,&quot; &quot;the way the truth and the life,&quot; and &quot;no man cometh unto the Father except by&quot; him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One grand feature of the work of Joseph is that of giving the needed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bread,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and there was no where else to go; so it clearly represents Christ's work as Life-Giver.  &quot;I am the bread of life;&quot; &quot;I am the truth;&quot; &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.&quot;  &quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">words</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Well may we say as did Peter: &quot;To whom shall we go; thou hast the words of eternal life.&quot;  Oh, that all our readers might realize that we are as fully dependent on the Lord Jesus for Immortality and Eternal life, as were the Egyptians dependent upon Joseph for the support of the natural life.  Eternal life only in Christ, is the essence of the Gospel. The first man did not have it, and so did not lose it.  He was natural; and the flesh was tried and failed that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">need</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Second Man might be appreciated.  Let us remember that in order to get the Bread we must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">apply</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for it as did the hungry to Joseph.  &quot;He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&quot;  Oh, ye hungry ones, feed upon his precious truth and be filled.  We would not overlook the realization of Joseph's youthful dreams.  His brethren that scorned him and cast him out had at last to come to him for bread, and they gladly bowed before him.  He whom they rejected and counted as dead became their benefactor and saviour. They looked on him whom they had pierced (in figure), and they mourned and were ashamed, but he fed them and even excused them-- &quot;It was not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">you</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that sent me hither, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Now, therefore, be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither; for God did send me before you to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">preserve life.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --`Gen. 45:5-8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let God's mercy be praised!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R58 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When Christ left the Jewish house desolate it was not eternally, but &quot;until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&quot;  In the coming day of restitution, the Lord says: &quot;I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and supplication (favor and prayer), and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and shall mourn.&quot;-- `Zech. 12:10`.  Yes, they will mourn and be ashamed of themselves, when in prayer before him whom they despised, even as did Joseph's brethren when they discovered their brother.  But it is the mourning of penitence, and not of despair; it is caused by the spirit of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">favor</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is shown them by the long lost brother now restored.  They find him exalted as a King and Life-Giver, and he cares for them.  They give themselves to him and he gives them a home and all they need. Thus we see that Joseph in many ways represents Christ, and confirms our view of God's plan of the ages.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truly, God is good, and &quot;his mercy endureth forever.&quot;  Well may we say, &quot;how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out.&quot;  What we cannot discover he can uncover or reveal; and &quot;thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift,&quot; and the glimpse he has given us of his plan and his love. &quot;We love him because he first loved us.&quot;  We love one another because &quot;he hath given us of his spirit.&quot; &quot;He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.&quot;    J.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Wedding Guests.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son.&quot; `Matt. 22:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Jews were first invited to the great feast, but they made light of the matter, were more interested in the farms and merchandise, and a remnant even persecuted and slew the servants who carried the invitation; in consequence of all which &quot;he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.&quot; (`Ver. 7`.)  Then the command is given: &quot;Go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage.&quot; (`Ver. 9`.)  This seems clearly to refer to the work of the Gospel among the Gentiles; and by people gathered from among them &quot;both bad and good, the wedding was furnished with guests.&quot; (`Ver. 10`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The parables of Jesus about the &quot;kingdom of heaven,&quot; seem always to refer to the &quot;church militant,&quot; or to the living mortal phase of the church; as soon as a man dies he is no longer represented in the parables, so the last part of the movement represented by the parable would include only the generation that are &quot;alive and remain.&quot;  So the &quot;harvest&quot; of the parable of tares and wheat (`Matt. 13`) relates to those that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;grow together</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until the harvest,&quot; which &quot;is the end of the age.&quot; (`vs. 30 and 39`.) And in the parable of the virgins, the going in to the marriage, refers to same act of the last generation. (`Matt. 25`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea of a wedding is often referred to by the Saviour, but it is somewhat remarkable that in such parables the believers are represented in the attitude of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">guests,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bride.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This fact has puled some, as Paul speaks of the church as the &quot;espoused&quot; virgin or prospective bride; and the Revelator speaks of the bride made ready as clothed with &quot;the righteousness of saints.&quot; (`Rev. 19:7,8`.)  The bride is therefore composed of saints, (holy ones); but why then should the last generation be called guests?  It is certain that the &quot;wedding garment&quot; is spoken of as properly belonging to the &quot;guests&quot; with which the wedding was furnished.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We suggest a solution, but as disciples we would gladly receive light from others.  1st. We understand the bride is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dead and living, raised and glorified.  2d. That the marriage is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">process</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of raising and glorifying the church, or the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">process of making up his jewels.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Mal. 3:17`.)  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">making up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> suggests a gradual and not an instantaneous work; as also, &quot;when the Lord shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">build up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Zion he shall appear in his glory.&quot; `Ps. 102:16`. This doubtless refers </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">primarily</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the restoration of the earthly Jerusalem during thirty-seven years, or from 1878 to 1914, which, according to the prophetic arguments, is the last half of the sounding of the seventh</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R58 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">trumpet.  But there are two Jerusalems --an earthly and a heavenly; a mount that could be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">touched,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and a mount Zion that could </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be touched. (`Heb. 12:18,22`.)  We believe these are related to each other; the one outward and Jewish, the other inward and Christian; and that both are to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">built up during</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the same period,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the last trump.&quot; According to the parables of the &quot;two Dispensations,&quot; Christ was due to enter or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">come</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> into the office of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">king</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the spring of 1878, the parallel of his riding into Jerusalem in fulfillment of &quot;behold thy king cometh;&quot; and the same king who has the power to restore the natural Jerusalem, has the power to build up the spiritual Jerusalem; and it is declared that he will reward the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--prophets, saints and them that fear his name, small and great&quot;--during the seventh trumpet, (`Rev. 11:18`)--the same period in which it has often been shown that the earthly Jerusalem will be restored.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">3d. To be in the light when this process is due is the privilege of the living generation, and because of this they are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">guests.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They understand when he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">takes to himself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his great power.  &quot;When he had returned having received the kingdom he then </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspects</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">guests</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rewards</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them.&quot; `Luke 19:15,27`. It is evident that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a work done in reference to the living, while they are yet mortal, for two reasons, first, the reward </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">follows</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the inspection, and second the unfaithful was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cast out.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea of being cast out of immortality seems absurd, as the immortal &quot;cannot die.&quot;  The case of the unfaithful servant cast out seems the same as the one found among the guests without a wedding garment, who shares the same fate. (Comp. `Luke 19:26` and `Matt. 22:13`.) From this it appears evident that &quot;going in to the wedding&quot; is not the translation of the living into immortality, but is coming into a position of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">expectation,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which may be lost on account of lacking certain qualifications, represented by the wedding garment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The servants gather, but they are not infallible, they do not know the heart, and the king </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sifts out</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> those unfit for the kingdom.  This inspection and sifting out we again remark is after the king comes, and yet before the &quot;power over the nations&quot; is given.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;dead in Christ&quot; have no part in this light, and therefore not guests, neither are they subjects of this inspection or sifting--their case was decided before they fell asleep. Hence Paul could say: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Henceforth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there is laid up for me a crown.&quot; When the dead in Christ are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and when the living are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they will be immortal too, both alike sharing in the position of the glorified church-- &quot;The Bride, the Lamb's Wife.&quot;  If it be kept in mind that the living are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">guests</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there can be no objection we think to our being guests now and yet in due time constituting a part of the Bride, when we put on immortality.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">After the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">king</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> comes, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is due, it should not be surprising if the subject of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">garment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should be uppermost in the minds of the guests; neither should we be surprised if there is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sifting out</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instead of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">gathering in.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  That many have passed through a strange test during the past year is known by them all, and the work goes on.  Let none be in haste however to judge their brethren, the Lord is judge, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will decide who is or is not possessed of the wedding garment.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Judgment Day.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what...?&quot; `1 Pet. 4:17`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the popular mind the day of judgment is after the end of the Gospel dispensation.  As regards the world, so it is; but as regards the church, as quoted above, it is now, in the present time, and has been all through the dispensation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of the christian who has seen God's truth clearly, we may say, in the words of another, written many years ago, &quot;He is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now on trial,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the investigating judgment is in actual session at this moment, and every individual [Christian] during his life is on trial before God, the righteous &quot;Judge of all the earth;&quot; and each one is, day by day, not only at the bar of the investigating judgment, but is himself the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">witness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for or against himself, and is every hour giving testimony on which the judge decides the case.  Solemn thought! And here let it be remembered that &quot;God will bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.&quot;  How solemn the consideration that each one of us is, every hour, testifying before Jehovah's court for or against ourselves!  Every word we utter is a part of our testimony; every act of our lives is but our own testimony in our own case; every temper of mind indulged or cultivated goes to make up the chain of testimony, and all our motives in life are so many links in the chain. What a life we are then living!  Always in court--always on trial--always giving evidence by which the Judge is to decide.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">What an awful thought!  Thank God we are not standing in the filth and rags of our own righteousness under the searching gaze of the All-seeing One.  We have a friend at court who has thrown his own royal mantle over us.  We have an Advocate, too--an intercessor at the throne of justice.  Besides all this, the Judge himself is &quot;Our Father;&quot; and &quot;as a father has compassion on his children, Jehovah has compassion on them that fear him.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Opposition.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Is it right to oppose what we believe to be error?  We think it is our duty to guard the flock against heresies, as truly as it is ours in any degree to &quot;Feed the flock&quot; with &quot;Meat in due season.&quot;  Christ warned his followers to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Beware</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the leaven (doctrines) of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.&quot;  And the Apostles are found not only teaching the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but warning against the entrance of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">error.  &quot;Shun</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.  And their word will eat as doth a canker, of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus; who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.&quot; `2 Tim. 2:16-18`.  What is true of one error is true of another, and it is the duty of teachers to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">defend</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as to teach,--Defend the hearers by defending the truth.  The inspired word &quot;is profitable for doctrine&quot; (teaching), not only, but also, for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reproof,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">correction,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and for instruction in righteousness.  It is clearly taught in the word that God has set watchmen on the Watch Tower, who are made responsible to the people to warn them against the approach of danger, and if the watchmen fail to do their duty the people's blood is required at the watchman's hand.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pleasant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> duty to preach the gospel, and also to present to the household of faith the many beautiful truths concerning the plan of salvation which we may have learned, but it is not so pleasant to defend the truth against errors.  If the first elements of the gospel introduced at the beginning of the age, have served so good a purpose during nearly two thousand years, it seems as if the abundant light of millennial dawn might serve, at least in part, for the age coming on.  But we still are on the watch for more, and will gladly accept </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through old channels or through new ones, if our Father sends it to us.  But we cannot accept as true whatever is presented by others regardless of our own judgment of what the word teaches, &quot;Prove all things and hold fast to that which is good,&quot; is an inspired statement of both duty and privilege.  It is our duty to learn, but it is also our duty not to learn. Gather truth, but reject error.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our object is two-fold,--to learn and to teach.  We believe God has called us to both.  If in our effort to teach we find it necessary to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">oppose</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the teachings of others, we purpose with the Lord's help to do so. Sometimes in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anxiety</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to get things new and startling, there is danger. And when our faith in its &quot;first principles&quot; is assailed, we find it necessary to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">defend</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The doctrines of Atonement and Resurrection, as we teach them, we regard as fundamental elements of the Gospel and of these we stand in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">defense.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">             J. H. P.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A Beautiful Temple.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The bible may be compared to a magnificent edifice that took seventeen centuries to build.  Its architect and builder is God.  Like this beautiful world, the work of the same Author, it bears on it everywhere the impress of a divine hand.  This majestic temple contains sixty-six chambers of unequal size--the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments. Each of its 31,173 verses is a stone, a beam, a panel of the building, which is a temple more glorious by far than that of Solomon or of Zerubbabel, with their hewn stones from Lebanon, their pillars of cedar, their doors of olive, their floors, walls, and ceiling overlaid with fine gold of Parodim, their holy places, their courts, their porticoes and gates. Would you have fellowship with the Father?  You will be sure to find him within the precincts of his holy house.  Shall we take advantage of the King's permission and step inside? We approach by the beautiful Garden of Eden, with its innocent flowers, its groves and lucid streams.  The first of the building, that of highest antiquity, bears the name of the Chambers of Law and Justice.  These are five in number-- the Books of Moses.  One of these is a sort of vestibule to the others, and resembles a long gallery hung with portraits and pictorial scenes of surprising interest--mementoes of persons and events that had place before a stone of the building was laid: such figures as those of Abel and Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Hagar, Sarah, Jacob, Esau, and Joseph; and such scenes as Paradise and the Flood, the departure from Ur of the Chaldees, the Tent-door of Mamre, the Flaming Cities of the Plain, the Offering of Isaac, Rebecca at the Well, and the Governor of Egypt weeping over the neck of his brethren.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thence we pass through an extensive range of imposing apartments-- the Chambers of Historic Record. These comprise the Library of the edifice, and in them are laid up the Church's archives for more than a thousand years.  These rooms are twelve in number, and stretch from Joshua to Esther.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then we come to a wide space called the Gymnasium of the building, or the saints' exercising ground --the Book of Job.  Entering right of this we find ourselves in the Music Gallery of the Psalms, the orchestra of the house, where dwell all the sons and daughters of song,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R60 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">with cymbal, trumpet, psaltery and harp.  Issuing thence we pass at once into the Chamber of Commerce --the Book of Proverbs; not far from which is the Penitentiary of the place, where sorrowful bankrupts and other defaulters may remain for a time with profit--the Book of Ecclesiastes.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A little further on we enter into a tiny parlor in the midst of larger rooms--the Chamber of Sympathy with Mourners--the Book of Lamentations.  Interspersed among all these the eye is regaled with such delightful conservatories of flowers as the Books of Ruth and of the Song of Solomon.  And next we come to a noble suite of lofty apartments, some of which are of great capacity, and are laid out with extraordinary splendor--no less than seventeen in number.  These are the Halls of Ancient Prophecy, and follow in grand succession from Isaiah to Malachi.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thence we pass to the portion of the edifice of more modern construction, and we enter four spacious chambers of peculiar beauty.  These are of marble fairer far than was ever taken from the quarries of Paros or Carrara--chambers of which one knows not whether the more to admire the simplicity or the exquisite finish.  At once the walls arrest us. On them we see not golden relief of palm-trees, lilies, pomegranates, and cherubim; but four full-length portraits of the Lord of the building himself, drawn by the Holy Spirit's inimitable hand.  These are the Books of the four Evangelists.  Stepping onward our ears are saluted by the loud sounds of machinery in motion; and entering a long apartment, we find ourselves face to face with wheels, and shafts, and cranks, and pinions, whose motive power is above and out of sight, and which will bring on changes all the world over.  This is the Chamber of Celestial Mechanics--the great work-room of the building--the book of Acts.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Leaving it, we are conducted into the stately Halls of the Apostolic Epistles, no fewer than twenty-one in range.  The golden doors of fourteen of these are inscribed with the honorable name of the Apostle to the Gentiles, those of the seven others with the names of James, and Peter, and John, and Jude.  Within these halls the choicest treasures of the Lord are stored.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And last of all we arrive at that mysterious gallery where brilliant lights and dark shadows so curiously interchange, and where, in sublime emblems, the history of the Church of Jesus is unveiled till the Bridegroom come--the grand Apocalypse. And now we have reached the utmost extremity of the building. Let us step out on the projecting balcony and look abroad:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yonder, beneath us, is a fair meadow, through which the pure River of the Water of Life is winding its way; on either side of it stands the Tree of Life, with its twelve manner of fruits and its beautiful leaves for the healing of the nations.  And in the distance, high on the summit of the Everlasting Hills, the city, all of gold, bathed in light and quivering with glory --the New Jerusalem; its walls are of jasper, its foundations of precious stones, its angel-guarded gates of pearl--the city that needs no sun, no moon, &quot;for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Oh! let us make this beloved house OUR HOME.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord, open Thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Selected.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Desire of All Nations Shall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Come.&quot;--`Hag. 2:7`.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the interpretation of prophecy, it is important that we should recognize the perspective principle on which it is based.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Several trees in the distance, in the same direction, appear near to each other, though quite a distance apart.  The space between them becomes apparent only as you approach them.  The eye of the prophet is permitted to see future events on the same principle, and though events may be centuries, or even millenniums, apart, unless there are prophetic periods given to locate them, it is impossible for us to determine how far apart they will be in fulfillment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Isa. 9:6,7`, relating to the birth, development, reign and final triumph of our Lord, is a clear case of the perspective.  Though written nearly eight centuries before the birth of Christ, the present tense is used: &quot;Unto us a child </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> born,&quot; &amp;c., and though the fulfillment requires ages, the prophecy is but a few words, without even a hint of the long time required.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another case in point, is the prophecy of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Messiah. `Isa. 61:1,3`. This work among other things both before and after is: &quot;To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,--and the day of vengeance of our God.&quot;  Christ himself &quot;rightly divided&quot; this scripture, not reading the latter part, because it was not yet due, and of what he read, added: &quot;This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.&quot; `Luke 4:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The day of vengeance was an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">age</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the future when he spoke.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The coming of Christ is on the same principle foretold as if it were a single event.  The phrases &quot;First Advent&quot; and &quot;Second Advent&quot; are not scriptural.  And though we do not object to their use, and will use them by way of accommodation, we nevertheless believe that the impression made is often </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anti-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">scriptural. Our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aim</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to remove misapprehensions as far as possible.  We believe that the coming of Christ is properly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> great and comprehensive manifestation; but that the process includes several lesser comings or manifestations as parts or stages of the whole.  This fact was made the stone of stumbling to the Jew, and it probably will prove to be such to many Christians.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That the prophecies of Christ's glory and kingdom were not fulfilled when he came in the flesh, is true, and as that was what the Jew had in mind, he failed to see the sufferings of Christ (`Isa. 53`), and so he was rejected by them.  It seems strange that any now should claim that in his incarnation and humiliation he came as &quot;The Desire of all nations,&quot; in face of the fact that he did not come to any but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The limited commission: &quot;Go not in the way of the Gentiles,&quot; found its sanction in Christ's own words: &quot;For I am not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&quot; Will any one in the face of this say he came then to all nations?  The first thing Christ did for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for them and that not until he had given up the nation to whom he was sent.  He was not desired even by that nation.  He was &quot;as a root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, no beauty that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">should desire him.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He is despised and rejected of men,&quot; &amp;c.  No clearer pen picture could have been given, than `Isa. 53`, of the estimate his nation placed on him and the manner in which they treated him.  &quot;He came unto his own and his own received him not.&quot;  &quot;The foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head.&quot;  &quot;We will not have this man to rule over us.&quot; &quot;We have no king but Caesar.&quot; &quot;Away with him; crucify him.&quot; These and many other facts prove conclusively that Christ in the flesh was not the Desire of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">any</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is evident that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shaking</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the nations and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overthrow</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">kingdoms</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> referred to in our text and context are to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">precede</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his coming as the Desire of all Nations.  Therefore Paul's reference to the language and his location of it in the future in his day (`Heb. 12:26-7`), confirm our conclusion that this scripture was not fulfilled at what we familiarly call &quot;The First Advent.&quot; Then will it be fulfilled when he appears the &quot;Second time?&quot;  Perhaps nearly all would answer, &quot;Certainly.&quot; But we are compelled to think differently. `Heb. 9:29`, is, we believe, the only place in the bible where the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occurs in connection with Christ's coming. And certainly nothing in this makes it impossible that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">other</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> comings should follow.  Mark, we do not affirm that what is here called the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not elsewhere referred to, but that when the coming is referred to, it does not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">always</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> refer to the second.  We wish to be distinctly understood as claiming that some of the prophecies of Christ's coming will be fulfilled </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he has appeared the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our question is, Is he the Desire of all nations at the second appearing? If not, there will be another coming, for God's word will be fulfilled. Paul's statement is: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;To</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them that look for him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will he appear the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> time.&quot;  Do the nations look for him?  Do they desire him? No.  Not even the professed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> desire his coming.  They </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">say</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they love him, but do not want him to come </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;in our day.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They say they care not if he comes not for &quot;ten thousand years,&quot; or even if he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> comes, for they expect to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">go to him;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but they DO NOT WANT TO GO?  God has given us the love of life, and the instincts of men are often better than their theology. Brethren, you ought to know that you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">can not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be with him till he comes.  He said, &quot;I will come again and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">receive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you to myself.&quot; At his coming the dead in Christ rise and the living are changed and caught away to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meet</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  Comforting words! `1 Thess. 4:13-18`.  These are doubtless in reference to his second coming,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R60 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">because it is to them that look for him.  There is a company who want him to come.  The little flock, the chaste virgin espoused, want to see the Bridegroom.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">They</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> love his appearing, and Paul says that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as himself, will receive a crown of righteousness in that day. `2 Tim. 4:8`.  There is no promise that he will come to them that do </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> look for, or who do </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> love his appearing.  And there is no promise that any </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> eye will see him at his second coming. Those to whom he then appears are to be changed, made like him, and shall see him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as he is.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Behold he cometh with clouds and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every eye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall see him,&quot; is a sample of passages often quoted against our position.  But this is one of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evidences</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of our position. The nature of events prove that the &quot;coming with clouds&quot; is not the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> coming.  He will come in all his glory, and in his kingdom, but not until </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after the saints are with him.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> When he thus appears to the world, to men in the flesh, to &quot;every eye,&quot; the saints are with him.  This is represented by a beautiful picture of the grand manifestation, on the mount of transfiguration.  Moses and Elias </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">appear with him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in glory. Brethren, do not confound this grand event with a previous one of his coming to raise the dead.  Three comes after two, just as certainly as two comes after one.  The same truth is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by Paul.  &quot;When he shall appear we also shall appear with him in glory.&quot;  What is true of the Head is true of the Body.  It is called &quot;the manifestation of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sons</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God.&quot; `Rom. 8:19`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The church's hope is the &quot;redemption</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R60 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of our body,&quot; `verse 23`, and is reached at the second appearing; but the world's hope is in the &quot;manifestation of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sons,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- the Head and Body complete,--the promised &quot;Seed&quot; whose work it is to crush the Serpent and bless all nations.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God made the creature subject to vanity but in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hope.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Ver. 20`.  And it is declared that the groaning creation &quot;itself </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">also</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (as well as the church who had the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first fruits</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the spirit) shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.&quot; `Ver. 21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is claimed by some that this manifestation is but a later stage of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Advent&quot; than his coming </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his saints.  To this idea we would not object so much, for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">order</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of events being admitted, would prevent the blinding effect of the popular view of expecting him to come for them and come with them and do a dozen other things &quot;in a moment&quot; as it were, and without any order.  But we are convinced that as his coming in the flesh was to the fleshly house of Israel, and only those knew it who were in the light.  So his second coming is to the church, &quot;to them that look for him&quot; and the world will know nothing about it until it is past.  That the second advent has its different stages and covers a considerable period of time, as well as the first advent we fully believe. Just as surely as the High Priests coming out was a work of time and had its stages, so surely our High Priest will fulfill them for not a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">jot</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tittle</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> can pass unfulfilled.  The first step in type was to leave the most holy, then he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tarried</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the holy place to cleanse it before coming to the people, and when he had done all, it was to them that waited for him he came.  This too is the very subject under consideration by Paul when he says: &quot;As--and so ...to them that look for him will he appear the second time.&quot;  His coming does not always refer to coming from Heaven, but is a manifestation, or it may be taking or coming into a new position or relationship.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a babe he came at his birth. He had come, but he had not come fully, i.e. all the steps had not been taken.  So John preached &quot;before his coming.&quot; `Acts 13:24`.  John says, &quot;there cometh one after me&quot; and again &quot;that he should be made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manifest</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.&quot; `John 1:31`. So Jesus was manifested as the Christ i.e. Anointed, by being anointed with water and that which it represented--the Holy Spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He then entered on the harvest work, but not until three and one-half years later did he fulfill the prophecy, &quot;Behold thy King </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cometh.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> First the birth, then the anointing, and last the manifestation as their King; but these were none of them coming from heaven.  His return from heaven is a coming, but every coming is not a return, at the second, any more than at the first.  That Christ will have come as a king--i.e., have entered upon the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">office</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of king--even before the living </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are translated, is evident from the parable of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">King</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> inspecting the guests before the marriage.  &quot;And when he had returned, having received the kingdom,&quot; &amp;c. `Luke 19:15`. Then follow the inspection of all the servants and the reward of the faithful.  The President must be inaugurated in his office before he can properly appoint his Cabinet; So Christ has his official honor conferred before he can share it with others.  And be it remembered that his saints are in office as ruling princes, before the kingdoms are cast down.  The Kingdom of God is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">set up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before the kingdoms of earth fall, for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms. `Dan. 2:44`.  &quot;This honor have all the saints.&quot; (`Ps. 149`.)  This overthrow of the kingdoms by the strong hand of judgment, is what will break the proud spirit of the nations: &quot;For when his judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.&quot; `Isa. 26:9`.  Together with these judgments the everlasting gospel will be preached: &quot;Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come.&quot; `Rev. 14`: &quot;And all nations shall come and worship before thee, for thy judgments are made manifest.&quot; `15:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus the great change will be wrought, the proud spirit broken, men feel their weakness, and the &quot;Desire of all nations will come.&quot; The Royal Seed, both head and body, having been exalted--Christ first, to prepare a place in the Father's house of many mansions; then the saints, gone to be with him in the house prepared: then will the Lord behold the earth, looking down from the height of his sanctuary, and hearing the groaning of the prisoner, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">deliverance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will come.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;When the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the Lord.&quot; `Ps. 102:19-22`. Thus in due time, though it has not been at any time in the past, Christ will be the consolation of all nations.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lordship of Christ.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A BIBLE READING.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord, signifies master, ruler, governor. Lordship, signifies Dominion, power, authority.  These definitions are related to each other and to the subject.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Husband, is also a definition of Lord.  The Anglo-Saxon word, Hlaford, from which our English word Lord is derived signifies Breadkeeper, and is applied to one who has the general care over, and control of a family.  The title of Lord thus applied to Jesus Christ is expressive of a glorious fullness of power and love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Bible students have doubtless been impressed with the numerous applications of this term to Christ in the New Testament.  Familiar phrases applicable to Christ: &quot;Lord of the Sabbath.&quot; `Mark 2:28`.  &quot;Lord and Christ.&quot; `Acts 2:36`.  &quot;Lord of glory.&quot; `1 Cor. 2:8`.  &quot;Lord from Heaven.&quot; `1 Cor. 15:47`.  &quot;One Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; `1 Cor. 8:6`.  &quot;One Lord, one faith and one baptism.&quot; `Eph. 4:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. He is Lord of dead and living.&quot; `Rom. 14:7,9`.  &quot;For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.  For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived, that he might be Lord, both of the dead and living.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">1. The fact is stated &quot;Christ is Lord of both living and dead.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">2. How he became Lord: By death and resurrection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Our responsibility: Being his we ought to obey him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The reference in this text is to Christians.  Christ died for all, and therefore has a claim upon the obedience of all.  A Christian is one that recognizes the claims and yields obedience.  Why should any one say, in the face of so plain a statement, that Christ has nothing to do with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but only with the living? &quot;Both of the dead and living.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">II. &quot;He is Lord of Jew and Gentile.&quot; `Acts 10:34,36`.  Then Peter opened his mouth and said, &quot;Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him...preaching peace by Jesus Christ: &quot;He is Lord of ALL.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The equality of Jew and Gentile under the Gospel was hard for Peter to learn.  He was convinced by the vision of the unclean beasts, and the voice: &quot;What God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hath cleansed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that call not thou common.&quot; `Ver. 15`. &quot;There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.&quot; `Rom. 10:12`.  Here, as Joseph, Christ is the bountiful Breadgiver.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">III. He is Lord of Angels as well as men.  &quot;All power is given unto me in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Heaven</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and in Earth.&quot; `Matt. 28:18`.  &quot;Wherefore (in consequence of his condescension and obedience unto death) God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name [official position] which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> knee should bow of things in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Heaven,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [angels] and in Earth [living men] and under the Earth; [dead men] and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.&quot; `Phil. 2:9,11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He who honors the Son honors the Father, and according to this passage whoever denies Christ's Lordship over angels and both living and dead men dishonours the Father.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they...and again...he saith, &quot;Let all the angels of God worship him.&quot; `Heb. 1:4,6`. They are his servants, therefore he is their Lord.  There is a clear contrast between Moses and Christ as mediators of the two covenants. Under the old covenant, Moses received the law from God through angels, therefore the angels were</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R61 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">superior to Moses; (`Acts 7:53` and `Gal. 3:19`) but in this dispensation Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">controls</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the angels, and under his loving administration they are ministering spirits to the &quot;heirs of salvation.&quot; `Heb. 1:14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">IV. As Lord he is the Great Teacher, Leader and Commander. &quot;Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.&quot; `Isa. 55:4`. &quot;All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.  Go ye THEREFORE and teach all nations, baptizing them...teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.&quot; `Matt. 28:18,20`. As Leader he is both our example in the life of obedience, and our Forerunner in the order of development, from the natural to the spiritual.  The obedience is our work, the spiritual is our reward. A great encouragement: He who has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has said: &quot;He that believeth and is baptized SHALL BE SAVED.&quot;  A serious warning: The same Lord has said: He that believeth not SHALL BE CONDEMNED.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">V. He has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> power, physical and spiritual.  As often expressed: Power over the body as well as the soul.  Many believing the latter are too apt to exclude the former.  As a Healer he confirms his word and establishes his authority.  &quot;Lo I am with you always even unto the end of the age.&quot; `Matt. 28:20`. &quot;So then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven...and they went forth and preached the word everywhere, the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following.&quot; `Mark 16:19,20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whatever</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> means the apostles confirmed the word, it was by the power of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord Jesus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> working with them or the above scripture has no force.  Examples of confirmation by healing diseases: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In the name of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Nazareth rise up and walk, and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.&quot; `Acts 3:6,7`. The case is the man, lame from his birth, who sat at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful.  And Peter said: &quot;Eneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole, arise and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.  And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and turned to the Lord.&quot; `Acts 9:34,35`.  Bear in mind Christ is Lord.  They turned to him, because these things were done by his authority and power.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Examples of confirmation by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destruction</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of life are given us in the case of Ananias and Sapphira.  &quot;And great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things.&quot;  &quot;And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.&quot; `Acts 5:11`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Healing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the Lord's usual method, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lordship</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ is illustrated by his power over life, either to kill or to make alive.  Examples of confirmation by raising the dead.  Raising the dead is the climax of physical healing; the power which can do the one can do the other.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;But Peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed; and turning him to the body, said: Tabitha, arise.  And she opened her eyes and sat up, and ...he presented her alive,...and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">many</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believed on the Lord.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Acts 9:40-42`. The case is very clear, and that the Lord's agency is recognized by the people is clear, because of their turning to him in consequence.  He prayed to the Father, doubtless; no other prayer seems to be scriptural;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R62 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">but had Peter neglected Christ's teaching--&quot;Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in my name</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he will do it,&quot; we cannot suppose his prayer would have been answered.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another case: &quot;Eutychus... fell down from the third loft and was taken up DEAD.  And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him, said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.... And they brought the young man ALIVE, and were not a little comforted.&quot; `Acts 20:9-12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His life was restored, by a similar method to that used by Elijah in raising the widow's son, (`1 Kings 17:17-23`); and Elisha raising the Shunamite's son, (`2 Kings 4:34,35`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That Christ has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to restore natural life, is not only clear by virtue of his Lordship, but by these examples.  Power is a cause to produce results; if never exercised, it would at least be vain.  These are samples and assurances of the coming Restitution of all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">VI. His power over mankind is secured by the Ransom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Def--Ransom (verb), to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">recover</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by paying the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">price.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Ransom (noun), the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">price</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> paid for recovery.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The ransom has relation to the thing bought as its equivalent.  Note the value of Christ's death.  &quot;There is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the MAN Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.&quot; `1 Tim. 2:5,6`.  Human for human is the legal ransom.  He became a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he might &quot;give his life (Gr., </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">psuchee</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the natural life,) a ransom for many.&quot; `Matt. 20:28`. It was the human life.  &quot;We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death;...that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man.&quot; `Heb. 2:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He took not the nature of angels, (if he had done so he could not have died--`Luke 20:36`), but he took on him the seed of Abraham.&quot; `Ver. 16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This enabled him both to sympathize with and to redeem.  &quot;Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same, (not that he might die for himself, as one of us, but) that through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he might destroy... the devil and deliver&quot; from death those who, while they lived, were afraid to die. (See `verses 14,15`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was not the preexistent life, but &quot;A </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hast thou prepared me. ...Lo, I come to do thy will, O God....By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&quot; `Heb. 10:5-10`.  &quot;Since by man (Adam) came death, by man (Christ) came also the resurrection of the dead.  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.&quot; `1 Cor. 15:21,22`. The making &quot;alive&quot; of the 22d is clearly the raising </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;of the dead&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the 21st.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I am he that liveth and was dead...and have the keys of Hades and of death.&quot; `Rev. 1:18`. Hades is the state of natural death, and the Key is the symbol of power.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">VII. As Lord, Christ gives immortality. This is the greatest life and work.  All the lesser steps have reference to this great outcome.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.&quot; `1 Cor. 15:45`. Adam gives the natural body, which is mortal; Christ gives the spiritual body, which is immortal.  (See context.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I give unto them eternal life.&quot; `John 10:28`.  He hath &quot;abolished death (by the ransom) and brought LIFE AND IMMORTALITY to light.&quot; `2 Tim. 1:10`. He gives life to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;And became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.&quot; `Heb. 5:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truly, Christ is Lord of all--angels, men, condition and things.-- God in Christ is our Redeemer and Saviour.  Our dependence is well established by the word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He has the highest claims on our hearts and lives, on account of the ransom paid, and the glorious expression of his love in this and all else he does for us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">May a &quot;patient continuance in well doing&quot; secure for us the &quot;glory and honor and immortality,&quot; which he has promised. `Rom. 2:7`.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Questions of Correspondents.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Answers by the Editor.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. I see no reference to the resurrection of the natural man, in a natural body in `1 Cor. 15`.  Does it not seem to treat only of the raising of Saints--spiritual bodies?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. In `1 Cor. 15:22`, Paul restates what he has everywhere affirmed, viz: That as by Adam's disobedience the race became dead, so by Christ's obedience all were in God's sight justified to live again, and in his due time, they will be delivered from death's dominion and restored to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> life.  He lays down the general proposition or truth that, &quot;as in Adam </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> die even so in Christ shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all be made alive,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but every man in his own order.&quot;  This indicates that several resurrections may take place before </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are raised.  Paul does not specify how many </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">orders</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or companies there will be.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He was writing to believers and informs them, that their resurrection is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first order</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;Afterward they that are Christ's at his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">parousia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [presence].&quot;  &quot;Then--the end.&quot; (The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cometh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not in the Greek.) The thought is: &quot;Then, i.e. after all the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">companies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">orders</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the dead are raised, &amp;c.--When </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are made alive.&quot;  Then, having rescued man from his fallen condition and having destroyed the last enemy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by releasing mankind from his bondage, the work which the Father gave him to do is accomplished, i.e., &quot;reconciling the world,&quot; having put down all rule and power opposed to the Father, then will he deliver up the kingdom to God even the Father; then shall the Son also himself be subject unto Him.&quot; `Ver. 28`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Does not `Rev. 20:4,6`, seem to ignore any but the two classes, viz: the blessed and holy of the first resurrection, and the rest of the dead who live not until the thousand years are finished.  Now where do we find the great </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution class</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mentioned in these two chapters?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. This text certainly does emphatically contradict the idea of the various orders of resurrection during the (1000 years) millennial age; and not only so but it also contradicts all scriptures which teach--&quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets;&quot; and it precludes the idea of &quot;all men being saved [from death] and coming to a knowledge of the truth;&quot; and it would prevent its being &quot;testified in due time [to all] that Jesus Christ gave himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom for all.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Tim. 2:6`.) `Verse 4` treats of the first resurrection, those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reign</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and live with Christ during the thousand years.  Now, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">if</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the rest of the dead&quot; (outside the first resurrection,) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;live</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the thousand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> years are finished,&quot; they certainly have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no probation,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for `verses 7 to 10` describe the final winding up of sin and sinners, symbolically termed a &quot;lake of fire and brimstone&quot; where the symbolic </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beast</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had been cast, &amp;c.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But how about this?  If `Rev. 20:5`, contradicts the balance of the Bible what shall we do?  This same point troubled </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">me</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> about eight years ago.  I knew not what to think. This text stood opposed to all thought of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the &quot;blessing of all the families of the Earth&quot; through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Seed,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Yet I could not think of discarding it even though the Prophets had said that Sodom, Samaria, Israel, &amp;c., were to be restored to their &quot;former estate, &amp;c.&quot;  I was in this perplexed condition until I found that the objectionable part of this `fifth verse` (the first sentence) is not to be found in three of the oldest MSS. viz: the &quot;Syriac,&quot; &quot;Sinaitic&quot; and &quot;Vatican.&quot;  The Syriac is the older, (second century) and the &quot;Sinaitic&quot; the most authentic and reliable MSS known; written about A.D. 350.  The only ancient MSS containing this sentence is the &quot;Alexandrine.&quot; It is not only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less reliable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (although recognized as valuable) but being written about the middle of the fifth century, it is less valuable than the more ancient &quot;Sinaitic&quot; and &quot;Vatican,&quot; because more liable to have its text interpolated during the century intervening.  The last mentioned three manuscripts are acknowledged by all to be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">best</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> GREEK texts extant.  The &quot;Syriac&quot; is not so authoritative because written in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Syriac</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> language.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon a careful reading of the context, you will notice that the connection would not only not be impaired, but positively improved by the omission of this sentence; read it: &quot;They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years: This is the first resurrection.  Blessed, &amp;c.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When copying was all done by the pen, the transcribers have, it would appear, frequently made a parenthetic or marginal </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">note</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of their thought upon the subject, designed to refresh their memory when reading it again.  These </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">notes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were mistaken by subsequent copyists for parts of the inspired text.  Another similar interpolation is `Jno. 21:25`, also omitted in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Sinaitic&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> MS. (See article on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Holy Bible&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- crowded out, will appear in Jan. No.)</font><br />
