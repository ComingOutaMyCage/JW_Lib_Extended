<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CAPITAL-LABOR TENSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NE SKIRMISH after another between capital and labor causes the common people, who have to foot all the bills, to wonder where this thing will end. Every •strike to improve the condition of some of us makes it just that much harder for all of us. And the strikes are each strange strikes. They are not what they used to be. This striking of policemen is an entirely new </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g, and a shock all around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’Theoretically police have no right at all to strike; for they represent us, the people as a whole. They are appointed custodians of law and order. We want to know where they are all the time, because we never know when we may need them. And yet we must not forget that the big boys in uniform are just ordinary men like the rest of us, and they have to live, and since the prices of everything have risen so dreadfully they have fallen an easy prey to the idea that they ought to have more money, so that they can provide their families with the thing? they need. It all seems human enough, when you think of it. But if they knew there was an ordinance forbidding them to join a union, then they should have obeyed the law. because they expect us to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The steel strike is and has been a long, hard battle. Pennsylvania is in line with what those acquainted with this section had expected. Many of the workers in the Eastern mills are of so-called &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch” extraction, a very conservative, slow-going, kindly-dis-positioned class of people who live simply, own their own homes and accept with resignation conditions which they can not easily change. In the steel business there have been but two shifts during the twenty-four hours, from time immemorial, the men generally working from 5:00 until 5:00, running one week on the day shift and the other on the night shift This arrangement gives the ’orlrfr one Sunday off every other week, and every other /»k he works a straight twenty-four hour shift, from</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5:00 p. m. Saturday to 5:00 p. m. Sunday. Then the following week he works from 5:00 a.m. to 5:00 p. m. each day up until Saturday inclusive, his night shift starting in at 5:00 p. m. the next day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The operation of'blaet furnaces continuously is almost inevitable, as the expense of shutting one down and starting it again is very great. In not a few instance*; the temporary shutting down of a blast furnace has caused the failure of the company operating it No doubt a part of the effort to get three shifts of eight hours each into the steel business, instead of the long twelve-hour grind which has been the rule heretofore, is due to the success of the railway workers in procuring a working day of eight hours. The work around a blast furnace or steel mill is as hard and as dangerous as railroading, and it is hard to see why the one class should continue to work twelve hour when the other has to work but eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">President Wilson’s conference at Washington of representatives of capital and labor had a great task mapped out for it &quot;for the development of a new rdv tionship between capital and labor,” but the labor delegates bolted and upset the program when the right of collective bargaining was not conceded by the capitalist group. It is hard to see how such a conference could do other than make further concessions to labor, because all can see that labor has the strength that comes from superior numbers, and it now seems determined to have a voice in the management of practically every great industry with which it is connected. In Japan this principle of &quot;attendance of labor delegates at all conferences of the company” has just been conceded to the printers of Tokio. This is the more remarkable because labor unions in Japan are outlawed organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A blind man, on the dark side of the moon, can aes plainly that an intelligent, determined, powerful majority will have its own way eventually. &quot;Be wise now, therefore, O ye (money) kings.”—Psalm 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">HIGH COST OP LIVING</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HO’S TO BLAME? If we can find him and fix </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> with one in the cranium, he is done for, and the difficulty, of course, will settle itself. Such a cast of mind makes Mr. Average Citizen an easy mark for people who are too smart for him. As a matter of fact, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to blame is often the best one to help fix things up, and may be as anxious as anyone to see his error corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">However, to d</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">efinitel</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">y fix responsibility for the high cost of living, may enable a good many Average Citizens to relieve some mental tension. Such responsibility can now be de</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">fini</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tely and finally set upon the right parties. To know the genesis of “H- C. L.” throws tight upon the subject. This is known in certain circles. The insiders even know the individual transaction with which “H. C. L.” was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tradition of the street has it this way: It was in the early days of the big war, in 1914 or thereabouts. The event, took place in the explosives industry. Many of the smaller nations were caught short of gun powder. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erican powder companies were filled with orders for way ahead. They did not care whether any more orders came or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the smaller countries had exhausted its patience waiting for the big powder companies to accept their order for a few million pounds. They approached a lesser concern supplicating permission to spend their money. Even the small companies were full of business from large customers, with orders booked far ahead. The ruling price was say thirty cents a pound. So the small concern, in order to discourage the small country, said that they would accept the order at a dollar a pound or thereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The general situation was in control of His Excellency, Mars, the world’s Over-Lord of the last few years, and powder at a dollar was cheap beside the possible ruin of War. The order was placed, and the little powder concern had the best order yet on its books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Within a month or thereabouts, the current price of powder was a dollar a pound. Other business grasped the golden opportunity. Other commodities, bought by countries at war, were jumped up to a figure intended to approach tde famous sfanokru’, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;&amp;Z &amp;&amp;&nbsp;fr&amp;Sc ircH </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Steel, iron, copper, lead, guns, pistols, leather, ships, ocean transportation, grain, canned foods and a swarm of others, left Mother Earth, for a trip whose top was the sky. Government control was forced into the field to regulate the race between supply and the demands of War. The insatiable greed of Mars for more and yet more to bum up and destroy in the Great Pastime, interl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ockin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g with the willingness of the trader to accept the enormous prices offered without haggling by the buying agents of foreign governments, created a bad combination for Mr. Average Man. He must pay more or go without and see the food and clothing the kiddies needed go sailing across the Atlantic. The imperative demand of hungry stomachs and cold backs were the enforced compliance of the common people with the ruinous course of the War Lords of Europe. Thus was &quot;H. C. L.” born and quickly grew from expansive infancy into boisterous maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The blame for the high cost of living rests upon Mars. The ready purse of War began it and sustained it On no other shoulders does exclusive responsibility rest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The whole world is crying out against the high cost of living; it is the cry of ignorance and emotion against plain arithmetic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mathematics says that there Is no cost </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of living </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">problem if the buying power of the worker is undiminished. If when commodities rise, wages rise to the same extent, the worker’s day’s labor continues to get him just as much at one time aa another. He lives v^rith the same comfort because he has the same things to work with, play with and live upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But the common people are common people because they are not smart enough for the uncommon people, many of whom started from the common level and by ability or crookedness have risen to places of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If the people were clever enough to insist upon having, in the business of exchange or trade, a measure of value that would not vary in actual value, they would not be troubled about the high cost of living. If a dollar would always buy the same quantity of goods, varying only with scarcity or plenty, the people would have one less important factor to contend with. Their wages_would always be at a figure that they could understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But when the dollar, right under the nose of the man on the street, imperceptibly shrinks day by day, the wage earner, to use a common phrase, does not know “where he is at.” In his </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d for many decades a dollar has been a dollar, and that was all there was to it. But with the advent of War a dollar ceased to be a dollar's worth, and Mr. Worker and Miss Worker found them-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">zzr&amp;zrtb ty &amp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Jgi? of ibis</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">world’s goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If the profiteer in labor had wished to find a clever scheme without being seen, to rob labor of the products of his labor, he could not have devised a better imtru-ment than the vanishing dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The business man could always raise prices at will unless he was hindered by a public service commission or by a food commissioner. Getting wages raised, however, was not so'simple &amp;&nbsp;matter because it was usually the result of a fight with the employer. The employer could always keep ahead in the race, for he could raise prices again and it would be some time before the worker would realize that the employer’s price-increase meant just that much real wage decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One party was making more than the other party. It was always the business man who did the price raising. He was making invisible differential between the extra pay grudged to the worker and the additional price he forthwith charged labor and which ordinarily was substantially larger than the wage increase it was supposed to balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Labor not understanding, and in the home circle finding the mathematics of prices and wages transmuted into emotions and feelings developed by privations of . loved ones finds it impossible to maintain the calm, self-। ’ possessed demeanor of pure mathematics. He first cries / out Some day he may act. Conan Doyle, the great English writer, says that unless effective steps are taken promptly to check rising food cost there will be grave violence in Great Britain. In Florence, Italy, the workers ransacked the stores of the profiteers and after declaring a strike secured a reduction in prices of fifty • to seventy-five per cent France has doubled the number of selling booths from which low price food is distributed and has established cheap restaurants to serve meals at fixed prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Low food costs are imperatively needed; but if food prices are forced down, who will pay the farmer enough for him to make a living and enable </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to keep on raising farm products for the rest of the people to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Truly in every direction there are intricate and perplexing questions which must be solved to keep the people from greater discontent, and yet the solution of .these problems appears to require a more than human wisdom, and a Solomon has not yet appeared to show the way- But—the Golden Age draws on apace, and soon the long looked for Messiah s</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">hall</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> arise and bring order out of the world’s confusion and chaos. &quot;Thy kingdom come.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">THE LITTLE PROFITEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAN has to live, and when rising prices are fashionable, the price autocrat has to make his profit represent as good a living as before. To a dealer wages or salary are spelled &quot;profit,” and his wage may be large or small or even minus—he must make money when the making is good. If prices double, the dealer, to have the same wage, should obtain like profit This is only fair. Any worker's income should vary with prices, so that there be nona of the inequity of soma getting less and others more. ITndesired consequences might be cited from such inequalities—unrest, discontent, vindictiveness, revolution, anarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The big profiteer does not bear sole responsibility for the prevailing distress. Everyone does who helped ‘•boost” prices or wages. The retailer did not neglect his part in raising the cost of living. In the sunshiny trade days of 1915-1916 some retailers were slow to sense the changing situation. Honest fogies, they could not charge a multiple profit on goods they had bought low. But the little profiteers persuaded them to &quot;play the game,” and get their share of the golden stream while it lasted. A grocery trade journal ran full-page advei^ tisementa that raising prices was the style and no grocer should fail to raise his; &quot;everybody was doing it,” and &quot;they could get the money.” It was a kind of golden age, which forced thousands of Fords and hundreds of &quot;sixes” and &quot;eights” upon a willing retail trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But now dealers looking for a too-good living have to be reasonable. It has seemed as though a jail sentence was the only thing to keep some dealers within bounds. For the public weal, the little profiteers have to adopt the new fair-price fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Profiteers are nothing new. They had them in days of old, when the prophet Ezekiel said, &quot;Thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbors by extoHion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God.”—Ezekiel 22:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">DECENTRALIZING PACKING</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE KENYON-ANDEBSON bill recently before</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Congress for the decentralization of the packing business aims to correct the waste in hauling animals from points all over the country to Chicago or Kansas City, and then shipping directly back the finished product. It hopes to eliminate a long string of commission merchants and middlemen. It proposes to license all packers and provides a list of punishable offenses for unfair, unjustly discriminatory or deceptive practices in commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The bill proposes to license any number of standardized plants erected by municipalities or subdivisions of states, or by their accredited representatives. It proposes that records and accounts shall be submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture and that the services of the plant shall be available to all customers on the basis of fair and reasonable returns and without unjust discrimination. It contemplates the services of special cars and the assistance of the Government in matters of inspection, standardization, plans and advice, but not financial assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the hope of the framers of the bill to change ths packing business from a centralized business into one in which the local centre of production will be the local centre of distribution. However, if it is profitable to decentralize the packing business, one can not but wonder why the great packers have not found this out long ago. But perhaps they have had too many other things or hand to give this phase of the business adequate attention. It is freely claimed that the big packers have been busier in cornering all </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">substitutes</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> for meat than in providing meat itself for the people at legitimately low prices. It certainly looks as though something is wrong when 700,000 lbs. of beef, lamb and pork are kept in storage so long that they have to be sold for fertilizer at l£c per pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FOOD AND CLOTHING</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CCORDING to the National Industrial Conference <sub>k</sub>Board in its recent research there is a race between food and clothing, as to which will increase the most in price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Between July,. 1914, and July. 1919, food increased in price 90%. but was distanced 10% by clothing, which increased 100%. Other increases were, shelter 28%, fuel, heat and light 57% and sundries 63%. The average advance in the cost of living was 73%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The figures computed by the Board ore claimed to be those of the average family expense or budget, and probably represent the facts, unless there was an effort to make the figures as small as possible in order to have them show that wages increased as much as the cost of living. There is an old saw to the effect that “Figures do not lie, hut liars do figure.” There is no intention to discredit the figures arrived at, but before accepting them as final, it might be well for “the man on the street” to know something about the personnel of the Board, their connections and the motives by which they might be influenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the Board the percentages of a man’s </span><span class="font5">family expense are distributed as follows: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Food 43.1%, shelter 17.1%, clothing 13.2%. fuel, heat and light 5.6% and sundries 20.4%, total 100%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">DEMAND FOR LABOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE maintenance of a proper labor supply depends somewhat upon the wages paid to labor- If the wages are sufficient to keep labor at work the supply is more plentiful than if some are not at work. A man who is idle temporarily because he is dissatisfied with his wages or other conditions of labor is, for that time, not a worker at all. If all the workers in the country went on strike at the same time it could not be said that labor is plentiful but that it is scarce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For some reason that does not appear on the surface the Scriptures intimate that just before the dawn of the Golden Age there will be a period during which work will not be obtainable on any condition. Possibly this will be caused by a temporary break-down of credit. The passage reads: 'Tor before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbor”.—Zechariah 8:10,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">PRINCIPLES OP SUCCESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a NY WORKER in any occupation might profit by the advice given to army officers by Major-General McGlachlin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">You must have courage, self-reliance and good judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Courage is a very common natural gift, but it may also be developed by practice in dangerous games and occupations-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Self-reliance is usually a result of training<span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and personal effort, to be attained by actually performing tasks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Good judgment comes from the study of your task before you do it and from reflection upon the results obtained and mistakes that may have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In your life from day to day, you should observe the principles of simplicity/ directness, thoroughness and promptness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The simpler your thoughts and reasoning, the more clear will be your decision. The simpler your language, the more easily you will be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Direct statements will result in clarity of understanding by your subordinates and by your superiors, and are equally appreciated by both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thorough treatment of subjects that you are required to handle will result in their effective disposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">You must train yourself to regard these subjects not merely from your own standpoint but from that of your superiors and that of your subordinates, keeping in view always the interests of the government which you serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do not sacrifice thoroughness to simplicity. Brevity is a virtue, but thoroughness is the more important principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Be prompt. It is indispensable. Procrastination is the root of all evil. Those who put things off do not do them- Those who do not do them are not useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">JANITORS ON STRIKE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE 7,600 members of the Chicago Flat Janitors’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Union are demanding $3.o0 to $5,00 an apartment a month and living quarters on or above the street. The flat owners declare that the janitors are now getting $125 to $175 a month, free living quarters, free heat, light and gas, and that the demands signify wages at $200 to $250 a month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE STATUS of the teaching profession is important because it reflects the public attitude toward the future welfare of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A report from 1,512 school superintendents indicates that the United States is short 38,000 teachers, or 5.8% of the 650,000 teaching positions. There are also 65,000 persons accepted as teachers who are not fit for their positions. This represents 103.000 teaching positions without teachers of even fair ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the 1.512 school superintendents, 1,430, or 94.6% report that the teachers' salaries have not been increased in proportion to the increase in the cost of living; 1,267 or 83.6% report that they have found it necessary to lower the standard of qualifications in the effort to get teachers; 1,052 or 69.6% report that the number of girl and boy teachers below twenty-one is increasing; 1,895, or 92.3% report that promising young men and women are not taking up teaching as in the post. The situation is least serious where salaries have been increased most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The development of the mind and character of the young is not to be compared with the washing of windows, if the criterion is the wage increase of the workers. Either the teaching profession is considered of no particular importance, or there is a systematic scheme to discredit the public schools by impairing their efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The real trouble may be that the teachers are a negligible factor because they do not control votes and are not properly unionized. Perhaps if the 650,000 American teachers were welded into a trades union they would have a labor backing which would give pause to school boards that pass up their petitions for relief from grinding poverty. No class of workers is more important than those that control the future of the people as the teachers do through the education of the young. They should be given salary increases at least commensurate with the higher cost of living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Nicholas Vel-mirovic, the moral and mental leader of Serbia, according to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Educational Review,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> asserts that &quot;If there is anything to be learned from the war, it is doubtless this: The education of youth in all the countries of the world must become an international affair of the very first importance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Neglect of the teaching profession bespeaks no promising future for this country, for the man. and woman of twenty years hence will be largely what the teacher of today makes them. &quot;Trcin up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it&quot; (Proverbs 22:6) is still a good recipe for the creation of future citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AVTO THIEVES IN FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INE HUNDRED automobiles, most of them stolen, were missed by the American Expedition in France. The car-stealing epidemic was not confined tn any one cla«s or any one nationality. If a car was left by the roadxide it was certain to disappear in a very short time. Perhaps a farmer hauled it to his farm and built a haystack around it. Or a passing unit of some other organization helped itself to magneto, carburetor, spark plugs, spare tires and spare wheel. Instances are on record where between dark and daylight, and in a driving mow storm, the three good wheels, engine, steering gear and radiator of a temporarily disabled machine disappeared and were never recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fords with the numbers painted out have been hard to trace, as it was practically impossible for anybody to prove that the car ever did belong to the American Expeditionary Force. The great majority of the passenger cars in the American army service, however, were unknown to France before the war, and when offered for sale were quickly recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many people who have or profess to have great respect for the eighth commandment* “Thou shall not steal” (Exodus 20:15), seem to take the position that it applies only to stealing from individuals In principle it is just as wrong to steal from an association of people as from an individual, yet there are many, even oom ingly respectable people, whose consciences are lax when it ccmes to dealing with a corporation, or with the Government The Scriptures show that in the Golden Age thefts end defalcations mast be made good for the full amount and 20% additional; and where, far any reason, as might be the case with a corporation, this cannot be made good &quot;unto </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> against whom he hath trespassed.&quot;, it is required that &quot;the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord.&quot; (Numbers 5:6-8) There is hope here for some who by stock manipulations have robbed corporations of millions. If personally required to make up all these defalcations they would be reduced to virtual slavery for myriads of years, but no doubt the &quot;recompense unto the Lord” will take some form of contrition not expressed so much in dollars and cents as in true repentance and reformation of heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">COLLEGE GRADUATE UNION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE IS an impression that the technical professions are very well paid. Young men by thousands are fitting themselves to become mechanical, electrical, and civil engineers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But there are so many young technical graduates that they cannot obtain adequate pay and hence they create a kind of educated proletariat. In New York they have been so underpaid by profiteering employers that they have organized a trades union and are asking salary increases of $500 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This affects 3.160, including junior engineers, engineering assistants, chemists, architects and inspectors in engineering work. The present college system tends toward an over-supply of educated workers and a killing competition among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If young men realized how poorly paying the technical professions are, especially at the outset, far leas would go to college but would enter the more remunerative and useful trades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The value of college education is greatly overestimated. Now that the workers are well paid, there is not the reason that formerly existed for spending four years and several thousand dollars for something that no longer guarantees a good income with relief from hard work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In breaking with all college traditions and lining up with the working people the young technical graduates of New York have learned that not exclusiveness, but cooperation wins success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The advice of old time is still good to &quot;consider the airt,” but the college man is learning from another of the insects of ancient Palestine which had a deserved reputation for getting whatever it went after: &quot;The locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands.'’—Proverbs 30:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">TOO LITTLE BAIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CCASIONALLY&quot; we hear it said that the bail required for certain violators is too large; there have been instances in which bail was denied altogether. But it is seldom one hears of a case where the bail might be considered too small. It seems to us, however, that $1,000 bail is too small a requirement for any one of the three men in Northern New York who climbed into the room of Mrs. Le Felche in the absence of her husband, pulled her from bed, stripped her in the presence of her eleven year old son and six year old daughter, and poured hot tar and feathers over her naked body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jews were forbidden to torture any living thing. Torture is wholly foreign to the character of him of whom it is written that he is &quot;the God of all grace”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 Peter 5:10) whose “tender mercies are over all his works”. (Psalm 145:9) Men who so far forgot their original inheritance of godlikeness as to torture a helpless woman in the night time, have fallen far. The Lord says to some such, “Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself” (Psalm 50: 21) and the int</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ima</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tion is that they thought wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">EDUCATION FOR THE POOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OW THAT COLLEGES are raising millions, next in order should be donations of large amounts to help the children of the poor who are not able to invest a thousand dollars a year for education. Twenty million dollars given to Yale represents about $5,000 per student. To properly or appreciably affect the education of the poor children would be an enterprise like a national drive for Liberty Bonds. There are, conservatively speaking, perhaps ten million children of the poor in this country, and to supply each one of them with an endowment that would provide an income of $200 a year would require the raising of the enormous </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sum of fifty billion dollars</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If it is a financial impossibility to provide a $200-a-year education for all the young people, it is probably a good thing that a few thousand Yale students are going to have that much added to the liberal amounts already provided for their education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Higher' education is regarded a good enough thing for tens of thousands of young men to invest in it hundreds of dollars a year a piece, but it is seriously lacking in one element, for after it has done all it can it usually leaves its beneficiaries in the position of those the Bible speaks of as “ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth”.—2 Timothy 3: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NEWSPAPER MEN ORGANIZE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> YEAR AGO Boston newspaper men averaged $21 a week. They organized a union, interviewed the typographers, pressmen and photo-engravers as to what they were getting, presented demands of $38 minimum for reporters and $45 for desk men, and got it. The newspaper owners did not want to recognize the union, but they did when they thought of the embarrassments of missing several editions. There was no mention of the brain workers* victory in any Boston newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The man who organized the Boston editors and reporters in his opening address alluded to them as brainless brainworkers. He seemed to think that, as the Scriptures express the matter, “the laborer is worthy of his hire,” and he could see no reason why the men who do the rough work around newspaper offices should receive twice the pay for their work as do those who actually supply the material for the reading public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If the bearings are loose, thick lubricants like graphite and grease are best, especially where there is flying dirt. Such lubricants form ridges around the shaft at the ends of the journal and close the openings to the entrance of sand or dirt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The best oils for high speed shafts with light pressure on the bearings are a mixture of 20% sperm oil (obtained from the blubber and head of the sperm whale), 30% olive oil (of which the better grades are dark and poorer grades light in color) and 50% light </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">eral oil*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For low speed shafts with light pressure on the bearings the best lubricant is 50% olive oil and 50% light mineral oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For high speed shafts with heavy pressure on the bearings the best lubricant is 35% lard oil (the liquid obtained from crystallized lard by straining under pressure), 25% sperm oil and 40% heavy mineral oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For low speed shafts with heavy pressure on bearings the best lubricant is 50% colza oil (a pale yellow oil obtained from rape seed) 25% lard oil and 25% tallow oil (obtained from solid tallow by pressure).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For moderately high speed shafts with very heavy pressure on the bearings the best lubricant is 35% sperm oil, 20% colza oil, 25% lard oil, 15% tallow oil and 5% fine plumbago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. For low speed shafts with very heavy pressure on the bearings the best lubricant is graphite-grease which consists of 25% tallow, 30% </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">palm</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> oil, 83% mineral oil</span></p>

These joints, in a way, compare to the bearings in a piece of machinery. Unless they are well oiled there is trouble. And again, if they are well oiled with the spirit of loving service of other members c£ the Body, “The whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. Ephesians 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">TEXTILES RUN FULL</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE PROSPERITY of the textile industry is shown by the percentage of the total number of spindles that are busy. At present the industry is running as near full capacity as possible, for on account of repairs and other necessary idleness it is never feasible for 100 per cent of the spindles to be in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The following percentages of spindles active at different dates clearly indicate the rise of the textile mills from the depression of last winter. The figures are for the woolen mills, which are fairly representative of the whole industry: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Present time, 92%, August 91%, July 91%, June 85%, May 83%, April 71%, March 58%, February 59%, January 63%, December (1918) 84%, November 88%, October 91%, September $2%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The total number of spindles in the woolen mills is 2,176,953 and in the worsted mills, 2,307,178, grand total, 4,484,131. Some branches of the business are running 95% of full capacity, and others are running double shift, the latter circumstances being the cause of the high prices for some goods produced on overtime pay rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If Solomon, the writer of Proverbs, were here today he might not advise to “Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise&quot; (Proverbs 6:6), but ‘*Go to the mill worker,&quot; for there has seldom been a time when the mills were busier than now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SUGGESTION SYSTEMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E ‘'MONEY makes the mare go/' ideas make the business go. The ideas of all the workers are more valuable than those of any one person. A business immensely benefittod where ideas flow naturally and freely from every worker to those that can make them operative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A variety of suggestion systems for employes has been tried out. In most instances they failed, but in a few cases they have achieved the hoped-for success. That the failures for outnumber the successes is owing to the failing that executives have of not giving really considerate treatment to those that work with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In one suggestion system described by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">System</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the writer ascribes the fault to the management:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“The blame rested wholly with the management. The general manager was not seriously concerned about getting Ideas that he could </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">use</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the workers. He was fairly confident that he and the executives associated with him were competent to run the business ni! right. The suggestion system he looked upon ns more or less of a game which might amuse the employes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“As a result of this attitude, no serious effort was made to apply the suggestions even though some of them gave indications of constructive thought on the part of employes, Not many workers can be kept continuously Interested In the moderately remote chance of winning a rather slender prize, particularly when the purpose of the contest is so obviously farcical.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the few cases where the suggestion system Is a success. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">System</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> continues, the controlling factors are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“1. The oper.mindedness of the management and the serious desire for ideas of employe?,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*•2. The willingness to consider thoroughly the ideas that are offered, no matter whether they seem good or not at first glance; and the intention la any case to let the employe know the decision and the reason for 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“3. The desire to reward fairly the man who makes the suggestion, If it has any value.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The danger that a management runs of being set down as simply hypocritical in asking for suggestions, crops out when the employe is net fully advised of the executive attitude toward the suggestion, and a detailed explanation is not given why the suggestion will not work or is net expedient at the time: ‘’'The Eastman Kodak Company.” continues </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">System,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> “uses an analysis sheet by means of which those responsible for looking into the suggestions of workers measure the cost of changes aguimt the savings they may effect. The worker is taken into the confidence of the management, and if an idea cannot be used with practical results, the reasons as they are shown by the analysis sheet ere fully explained to him.” As a result, this concern receive* cordial cooperation from its employes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In contrast to the Eastman attitude, the following about a superintendent who at first bed apparently favored a suggestion, tells the story of the complete failure of a suggestion system: “A day or two later he (the superintendent) told the department head he had decided against it, ending with ‘for reasons which I cannot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">disr</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ug? with you/ Imagine how speedily that wan, who could not or would not take the time to give hi* reason* to a responsible department head, would have spoiled the chances of any suggestion system.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Frank and cordial treatment of workers is likely to keep them more interested in their work than in ideas for social, industrial and political change, and the opinions of executives in this respect is somewhat as follows: “It is safe to say that when the minds of workers are turned in the direction of building up, there is not much room for those ideas which tend to tear down and destroy, ideas often lying hidden, making the workers disgruntled and gloomy of temperament, inefficient of hand, and fertile soil for seeds of unrest, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">dissatisfaction, or industrial strife.” Evidently the safe thing for business management is to be a kind of “big brother” to those who work with them. In the present crisis nothing less will answer than the practical application of the Golden Rule in every business. Such a business is likely to suffer least in the periodic labor storms that sweep over industry after industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It pays to be brotherly. It is the natural thing for men to treat one another with consideration and even with brotherly love. It is the thing that is to be the rule in the fast-approaching Golden Age, for the rule then is to be that every man, from executive down, to hold his position, must “love his neighbor as himself/' and that those that will not accommodate themselves must inevitably be dropped as the misfits of a better social order, the unfit that cannot survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">WILL LABOR BE SCARCE!</span></p>

If we lend her what she requires labor will be scarce, for we shall have to continue to run our fields and workshops at full speed to fill her requirements; but if we withdraw our credit then there will be a change in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Just at present labor is scarce in America. More than 3,000,000 men have been returned from the United States army and navy to civil life, and nearly all of these have at once found profitable employment One thing that has made this possible is the immigration , </span><span class="font5">situation. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is no immigrant labor to be had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prior to the war we were receiving a net immigration from Europe of 800,000 persons annually. During the past five years there has been no net immigration, the number going out having just about equalled the number coming in.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">PROGRESS OF AUSTRALIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE YEAR 1917 the manufactures of Australia amounted to over one billion dollars. This means that she is rapidly coming into a position where she will be able to produce all or nearly all the things she needs or uses. At present her principal imports are apparel, machinery, paper and drugs. The exports consist principally of grain, dressed meat, hides, wool, and metals. The country contains rich stores of gold, coal and other metals and minerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Australia is 2,400 miles long and 1,900 miles wide. The interior is at present an immense plateau, an almost barren plain, except in the eastern and southeastern portion, in which there are extensive plains admirably suited to stock-raising and agriculture. The rivers are subject to great irregularities, depending upon the fall of rain. The climate is generally hot and dry but very healthy. Occasionally there are excessively hot winds from the interior which result in great discomfort, followed by cold winds from the south. Snow storms are common in June, July and August, the winter season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Australian trees and bushes generally have scanty foliage and thick leathery leaves, well fitted to retain moisture. Some of the eucalyptus trees have been found to measure 500 feet in height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Australia was first settled in 1788 as a penal settlement. In 1851 gold was discovered in large quantities and a great immigration followed. The last convict vessels arrived in 1868, and in the 80 years in which it was a penal colony. Australia and Tasmania received about 140,000 of these exiles from their native shores. The effect of the outdoor life was to restore most of these convicts to noble, upright, healthy manhood. Many of the most respected families of Australia today trace their lineage to these men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Come to think of it, we all trace our lineage to a convict, an </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">exile</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">; namely, father Adam For God &quot;hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth; and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek after the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be uot far from every one of us.&quot; (Acts 17:26,27) God foresaw the wisdom of placing a hardy race of men to subdue the Australian continent and pursued the policy, strange to us. but wise, as we now see, of letting its pioneers be exiles who for one reason or another had incurred the displeasure of their fellow men. and been banished from, their midst, only to find a happier home elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">WASTING OTHERS' MONEY</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19191126_files/g_E_19191126-4.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:17pt;">

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PEOPLE who have done the least work in the world, and therefore have the least right to be wasteful. are frequently the most prodigal in wasting money which has been saved by others and which temporarily comes into their care. Representative Bland of Idaho, who has been investigating conditions in France, reports that 70 per cent of the funds sent to philanthropicand benevolent organizations in France has gone for expenses of administration and that the committee of which he is chairman are bringing with them copies of an agreement under which $1,000,000,000 worth of Government property which included. as two of the items, food and textiles alone worth $500,000,000, was sold for $400,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Possibly it was necessary for Government employes to destroy several million dollars worth of automobile parts and other material at Verneuil, France, as testified by a former officer of a motor unit in the expeditionary force, but it seems hard to believe that some use could not be found for bales of flax, automobile bodies, wheels, tires and axles in a world in the condition of the one in which we now find ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The end of the war has left the War Department with a great number of unused automobiles on its hands, some 47,000. Many of these, still in their crates, are piled five high in au open field near Washington, where they have remained ever since the armistice was signed, their covers and upholstery rotting away and their machinery covered with rust. Congress is now pressing for the sale of these machines, and with many of the automobile factories three months behind in their orders there seems no reason why they should not be sold at once for what they will bring. Any money the Government can save in this way will be so much leu it will have to procure otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The greatest waster of the ages is a something described in the eighteenth chapter of Revelation as &quot;Babylon the Great<sup>1</sup>. Concerning this symbolic city it is said that &quot;in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.’’ (Revelation 18:24) The fall of this mystical city is indicated as just preceding the thousand year reign of Christ, described in Revelation 20:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">RAILROAD EQUIPMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ONTRARY to expectation the equipment of the railroads is not being kept up as thoroughly as it should, and the manufacturers of railroad equipment are being hit by a shortage of orders. The Government is seeking to reduce the billion dollar shortage on the anticipated Income from operation, and for the time is letting equipment go. Railroad men say that there can be no relief for a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At the same time there is an enormous demand for railroad equipment in foreign countries, but the proper arrangements have not been made yet for financing huge orders from outside the country. European countries are able to pay only in bonds and the American banks are not prepared to handle such bonds for the equipment concerns. With an unprecedented need for their product in domesticand foreign markets, equipment manufacturers are obliged to see their plants dose down for lack of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CONFERENCE OF ADVERTISING MEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE PROCEEDINGS of the Associated Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Clubs of the World,, held at New Orl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">eans</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> September 24th and 25th, read like a page from the proceedings of the League of Nations. There were delegates from all parts of the United States, canada, Mexico, Cuba, Great Britain and Argentina, cablegrams from the Prime Minister of Australia, the President of Peru and other dignitaries whose habitat is far from our shores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The subjects discussed were such as to how to help Mr. Wilson solve the industrial problem, how to make Latin America better known to the people of the United States, how to protect Liberty Bond holders against securities of questionable value, how to make the United States better known in Mexico, and other subjects such as one would expect to engage the attention of statesmen but which very properly engage the attention of those who have so much to do with molding public opinion and directing the success of public ventures as falls to the once-despised advertising man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The advertising man of today is a disseminator of information. He is expected to supply real news, and if the concern with which he is connected is not doing work that is important enough to merit publicity there is no reason why it should expect the public to be interested in what it has to say. The advertising man is a pusher for business, a pioneer, an expert in the art of creating new wants or new ways to supply old ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Every person who announces a policy is an advertiser, a publisher, a proclaimer of what he purposes to do. When Satan said, ‘T M ill exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; 1 will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High* (Isaiah 14:13,14) lie vus advertising or announcing his policy, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">nam</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ely that of Self-aggr</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">and izem</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">prnpnt. When ouj Lord said, “I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me<sup>7</sup>’ (John 6:38) he was advertising or announcing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> policy, that of complete submission to the Father's will. In the Golden Age it will be apparent to all that his was the wise course. The Lord's present high exaltation ‘’above every name that is named” is justly merited. In his prehuman existence, and in his earthly minirtry, he was always faithful and efficient in all that he was given to do. His promotion was as inerttable as was Satan's downfall and r</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AIR TRANSIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HILE transit by air is not yet out of the realm of science, in some cases it almost approaches being an established method of transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The difficulty of using air commercially is its danger and excessive cost. A motor truck or automobile can stop and rest if disabled, but there is short shrift for the airplane that would like to rest in mid air. To make air travel even approach safety there would have to be established air lanes marked by landing places frequent enough for a machine to volplane to safety anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Efforts are being made to “practicalize” air travel. An airplane of 19,000 pounds, to carry 3,000 pounds of mail, and equipped with three motors and wireless telephone, and manned by two pilots and a navigator, is being built to run between New York and Chicago in seven hours—provided no</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thing</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> happens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Giant gas-bag machines are planned in England to travel between New York and London. They are to be luxurious affairs, with saloons, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">lining</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g room, and sleeping cabins. The equipment contemplates 3,500,000 cubic feet of gas, a carrying capacity of seventy tons, a nonstop ability of 6,000 miles and a speed of eighty miles an hour, to cross the Atlantic in fifty hours—always provided the inevitable does not occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It was an approach to practical transportation when a nine-year-old Texan with his mother rode from Houston to attend school at New York. The trip was safely made from Dallao, via Arkansas, Illinois, Indianapolis, Dayton, Cleveland, Buffalo and Binghamton. The risks of the air lane were sharply illustrated by the killing in a fall of Major Frissell at Port Jervis. N. Y. He had said the air was “bumpy”, and it proved to be so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the present state of air transit, men, Like riches, “make themselves uings; they fiy away as an eagle toward heaven” (Proverbs 23 :5), but men lack the sure sustaining power which keeps the eagle safe and sound in his wide flung kingdom of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">sky</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>POLITICAL, DOMESTIC </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> FOREIGN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">OUR BOYS AND THE FRENCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">k</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> GREAT many American soldiers did not come away from France with very good opinions of either the country or the people. They detested its mud, which is everywhere, its unpaved streets, its lack of bathtubs, its omnipresent manure piles, its system of charging Americans several times as much for supplies as it did Frenchmen for the same articles, and its women most of all. The true American loves and admires true womanhood and finds little to admire in a community where, according to a prominent D. D., a man can enter almost any home and treat the woman of that home as his own wife. And he stated that this is largely true throughout France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The French people did not find all of our soldiers all that they should wish, either. They found them too much addicted to hard liquor, and not infrequently too rude in speech and act. The effect of French liquors upon our soldiers may be judged from the fact that at one time in the summer of 1918 there were 30,000 officers and men of the American troops absent without leave from their organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the mother of an American soldier now buried in France, the French are reported to be greatly shocked over the American neglect of some cemeteries in which are buried the American dead. Some of these cemeteries, a year after they were first used, were said to be full of rows of closely packed white crosses and long trenches instead of, as with the French, individual graves, carefully cared for. In some of the cemeteries there was said to be no flag flying, no person on guard, nothing to indicate that anybody had any interest in the weed-covered grounds. In the French grounds the officers and men are buried together; in the American grounds they are kept separate Wliat is the reason for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">General Pershing is of the opinion that the Americans who fell in battle in France should be allowed to lie where they are now buried, but this does not seem to agree with the general sentiment of those who have lost their loved ones on the field of battle. General Pershing was given a great welcome on his arrival in New York, but his return did not awaken the enthusiasm expected, and a few days later the proposition to award him a golden sword was received so coldly in Congress that it was abandoned for the time. The American people are thinking a lot now about the boys they have lost and are not so much interested in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It will be a great day for the fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and sweethearts of the boys that fell in France when ‘’all that are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth” (John 5:28,29) and it will be a great day for the boys themselves. V/e believe that this awakening of those now asleep in death is near at hand and that it will not be so long before some of those boys now buried in France will come and look at the very places where all that was left of their mortal remains was laid in the summer of 1918. In a future issue we hope to give the reasons for our belief that the resurrection will begin within the next decade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SIZE OF PEACE ARMY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS GENERALLY believed that Senator Chamber</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">lain effectually killed the so-called March bill, recently presented for Mr. Baker, Secretary of War, and the General Staff of the United States army. Senator Chamberlain denounced the bill not only because it aimed at a vast military establishment, 509,000 men in time of peace, but because the General Staff wanted for the purpose a lump sum to be expended entirely at its discretion, Congress merely serving in the capacity of milker of the public cow to provide the funds. Senator Chamberlain said that the bill as proposed spelled “Militarism to a degree never surpassed in the palmiest days of the great general staff of the German army.” The General Staff was what ruined Germany. There is no General Staff in the navy, probably the most efficient, best managed department of the Government. Perhaps that is the reason for its efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It may be true that there are good reasons why the United States peace army should in a few years be four times as great as it was in 1917, but it would seem as though the wreckage in Europe' should be convincing that it is not a good thing to have millions </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> armed men standing around with nothing to do. It stands to reason that some of those men, those who have the most to gain by it, or who think they have the most to gain by it, will use what influence they have to bring on war, in the hope of profiting thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the proper size of a standing army for the United States in time of peace? Should it be 500,000 as proposed by Mr. Baker, or 300,000 as proposed by General Mcandrew, former Chief of Staff of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erican Expeditionary Force, or 120,000 as it was in 1917? Obviously it all depends an what we want the army to do. There is no need in hiring for a particular job of work four times as many workers as are necessary for that job. And then there is to be considered also, that to get men for this particular job the wages must be high enough to attract them, or they will have to be obtained by conscription, and it does not seem reasonable for the United States to resort to conscription in time of peace. Various forms of peace conscription have been proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are but two general reasons for ar. army in time of peace. One is to properly guard our outlying possessions against sudden attack, and the other is to maintain order at home. What reason is there to believe that the forces adequate for this purpose in 1917 would not again be adequate in time of peace? Senator Swanson says with .reference to large military expenditures, “A large part of the immense sums now appropriated for armaments could be utilized to secure better educational advantages, to construct good roads, to build better homes, to aid religious and charitable institutions, to develop industries, and for the general advance of comfort and civilization.” These are the words of a statesman and this is a statesmanlike utterance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In time of peace the principal duty of the United States army is to preserve order within the United States itself, and possibly with the idea that because of post-war conditions there would be more disorder than usual, Secretary of War Baker has issued orders that hereafter State officials can call directly upon commanding generals of military departments in their vicinity to furnish such troops as may be necessary for the protection of lives and property, thus performing duties which formerly devolved largely upon the National Guard of the State itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The armies of olden times did not amount to much, at least not to start with. The first account of a ‘•battle” recorded in the Scriptures is in the fourteeth chapter of Genesis. There four kings carried away captive Abraham’s nephew Lot, after they had defeated the five opposing kings. We are not to suppose that the army which captured the Sodomites was a large one, even though the names of four kings are introduced in connection with it. This was not a very long time after the flood, and the entire population was not as yet large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The suggestion of certain higher critics about vast ■rmies, great cities, etc., at this time, are out of harmony with the facts—first, the shortness of time after the flood; and second, the ability of Abraham with 318 men, to even make an attack and disconcert and confuse the army and deliver Lot and the Sodomites and all their goods. These facts all agree that the cities, the armies, the kingly powers of that day, were very meager in comparison with what we have in mind when we use similar terms in our own day. In all probability the armies of the four kings combined did not exceed a thousand men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Senator Chamberlain has protested that there must be a reformation of the court martial system which will make it impossible, as was recently the case in Texas, to impose the death penalty for a minor offense and then carry it out within 48 hours, before the papers in the case could reach Washington for review.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">WHO ARE AXARCHISTS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NARCHISM, as a philosophy, according to the Encyclopedia Erittanica, is the opposite of Socialism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The aim of the Socialists is to center all power in the Government and io make the Great State, as they call the prospective socialist arrangement, the controlling factor in nearly every activity of human life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Anarchism</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">chi&lt;m thinks that the State already has too much power, and that nearly all the troubles of mankind originate from that fact. Socialism believes in centralization of power more and more, in behalf of the people. Anarchism believes in decentralization for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Believers in the theories of anarchism are of two distinct schools, the one believing in the gradual spread of their doctrines and the other believing that force is necessary. There is great antagonism between the two schools of thought, but both a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">dmi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">t that if their philosophy should prevail it would wipe out the weaker mental, moral and physical specimens of the race. This is not a very cheerful outlook for any of us that are privately ' forced to admit, just to ourselves, that we are not os strong either menially, morally or physically, as we could wish 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We do not know to which of these schools of thought Alexander Berkman and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Emma</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a Goldman belong. We only know that these two are largely in the public eye at present as they have just been released from prison and are known as anarchist leaders. Berkman is described , correctly as “a studious, earnest, widely read </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of very pleasant, quiet manner.” He designates himself as “an idealist whore views and ideals conflict with those of capital.” When asked in court if he was an anarchist he refused to answer, further than to say, “The hearing is an invasion of my conscience and my thoughts, not an inquiry into my actions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Homestead steel strike twenty-eight years ago, when he was but a lad, Berk</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> shot and injured H. C. Frick, and for that crime spent fourteen years in a Pennsylvania prison. His sentence of two years at Atlanta Penitentiary, just completed, was for violation of the sedition act. Miss Goldman was arrested and sentenced at the same time as Berkman and has just been released from the Missouri State Penitentiary at Jeflerson City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Both Mr. Berkman and Miss Goldman have issued statements of conditions in their places of confinement that call for investigation and action. Officers who disobey the state or federal rules in their management of prisons are anarchists themselves, are they not? The meaning of the word “Anarchy” is “without rale” and j rules are even more necessary for the rulers t</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> for the ruled. If a ruler does not abide by the rales expressly prepared to limit his own power, how c</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">a</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">n he, with a good conscience, require of others that they keep the rules he is supposed to enforce?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And then comes up the question of Bolshevism. Is that Anarchism? The general idea in the public mind &gt;&nbsp;seems to be that it amounts to the same thing, and there has been a \ast amount of literature circulated to encourage that idea. But we have an interesting proof ’ that the two are quite different, and that not in Russia, * where the anarchists are recognized as entirely separate &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and distinct from the Bolshevists (Socialists). We had i the illustration in this country, at a lecture room of the Rand School, where there was a lecture on the meaning of the term ''soviet”. The hour devoted to the lecture on this topic had passed; and the room was occupied by a committee giving careful attention to the housing problem, when it was burst open by a gang that threw &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">them into the street, along with their furniture, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">made a complete wreck of the room. The men who broke up this orderly meeting of thinking men and women were anarchists, were they not? If not, what were they? At any rate they were not friendly to the soviet (Bolshevist) idea and made the attack for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And what about those riots in Omaha? There a mob of five thousand people partially wrecked the county court house with bombs in order to wreak their vengeance on the negro whom they finally succeeded in lynching. All law and order were thrown to the winds, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and the mayor who attempted to stem the tide was strung up and barely escaped with his life. Is it not a</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark23"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">good time to do a little heart-searching on these</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark24"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">questions?</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On August 9th, Representative Blanton, Democrat, of Texas introduced in Congress a joint resolution “declaring that a state of anarchy exists in United States, authorizing the president to free interstate mails and traffic from further unlawful interference, and to adequately protect citizens in their property rights.” Hera &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Representative Blanton is apparently accusing one or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">more departments of the Government itself of not / ; living up to the rules which have been prepared by Congress to limit its powers. His position is that the men who have violated these rules are anarchists. Is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At Portland, Oregon, on September 15th, President Wilson expressed conviction that unless the League of Nations becomes a reality, now existing Governments will be overthrown and their form changed. On the same day Senator Overman of North Carolina in the United States Senate used almost the same language, saying. “Until this is done there can be no peace, but unrest, revolution, starvation and anarchy will stalk up</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and down the world, bringing in its wake destruction of nations, social disorder, wretchedness and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">finall</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">y the ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extermination of the races of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>!</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously enough only one day previous Arthur</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henderson, British labor leader, said in the International Socialist conference in Switzerland that before</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two days later he said in England, “The present</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Two weeks later the Governor of New York summoned ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people “to a continual exercise of pure patriotism</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">। &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and love for country and its institutions, to the end</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawlessness.<sup>1</sup> and on October 3rd the president of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers told the Senate ' investigating committee that in the refusal of Elbert H. Gary, chairman of the Board of the United States Steel , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporation, to arbitrate the steel strike Gary “is sowing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the seeds of anarchy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now who are the greater anarchists, those idealists like Berkman or Miss Goldman who believe in certain theories which they wish to see established, ar those prison officials who disregard the laws made to control . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, or those roughnecks who wrecked the socialists’</span></p>

It seems clear that the title of anarchist is </span><span class="font3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">one that is freely handled by those who do not give the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the world is filled with much disorder and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violence at present can not be questioned by any intel</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ligent person who reads the news of the day. The causes of this reach back to the Great War. During the days | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;ff the war, and before those days, the people who should</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have been taught to love their neighbors as themselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">were taught a lot of other things that are now </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">finding</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g their natural expression. It is an unhealthy and ungodly environment that can be stirred to great enthusiasm and activity only by opportunities to help participate in some | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form of violence, and cannot be equally enthused by</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">opportunities to help bless the lowly in some quiet unobtrusive way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the face of so much strife it seems hard to realise</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that we are really at the doors of the Golden Age, when the Lord's kingdom shall be established and “the meek shall inherit the earth.” (Matthew 5:5) Yet we have long prayed for that kingdom: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10) and if we believe that our prayers are worth anything, we must believe that just such a condition of things is coming. Everywhere the Scriptures teach that the dawning of that better day will be in times of temporary strife and tumult such as we now see about us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. “Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.” (Psalm 46:3-10) Here the three steps occur in their natural arrangement, first the desolations which wo observe following the Great War, second the full end of militarism, third the full establishment of God's long-promised kingdom in the hearts and lives of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The words of the Lord, &quot;Blessed are the meek” (Matt. 5:5) and &quot;Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord” (Psalm 33:12), are as true today as ever they were ; and the time will come when a weary world will turn back to the Scriptures as affording the only safe and sane basis for the conduct of the affairs of men. In the Golden Age now at hand the' Lord will &quot;break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth”. —Hosea 2:18.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AGRICULTURE IN ALASKA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE AREA of Alaska is a little more than the combined areas of Maine. New Hampshire. Vermont, Massachusetts. Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New Jersey, Pennsylvania. Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. The tillable area is about equal to that of Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Much of the land, even on rather steep hillsides, is boggy, the drainage being poor. The formation of the soil and the blanket of moss, almost universally present, greatly extends the marshy area. In some places the layer of dead and living moss covers the ground to a depth of several feet. The power possessed by the moss of absorbing and retaining large amounts of water and its character as a nonconductor of heat will, to some extent, account for the cold, wet condition of the underlying soil. The presence of this dense mossy layer makes travelling very difficult, since crevices, rocks, fallen limbs, and trees are so covered that numerous pitfalls are hidden from sight. Beneficial results follow the removal of the moss so that the soil may be warmed and thawed earlier in the season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In general, the coast of Alaska is characterized by great rainfall and a rather constant temperature, due to the Japan current, which sweeps the whole coast. In many places zero temperature is seldom experienced. The average daily range of the thermometer during the summer months is very small. The temperature at Wrangell, Juneau and Sitka are almost the same as those for the same period at Trondhjem and Bergen, in Norway, Helsingfors, Finland, the whole of Scotland and the Orkney Islands. The total amount of summer rainfall, while large, is not excessive. In general, along the coast region, the winter's snow has disappeared at sea level by the middle of April, although snow Hurries are common for some time after that date. Killing frosts are seldom experienced between May and October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The organic content of many of the Aloskau soils is very much higher than in any of the agricultural lands of the States. Frequently the soil is acidulous and requires considerable lime to sweeten it. In places the •oil is peaty in appearance and when dry it bums &gt;&nbsp;readily. There is considerable of this soil in the southeastern portion. In southwestern Alaska a gravelly subsoil is more abundant and the presence of volcanic material in some places renders the soil very rich and requires less drainage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The southeastern part of Alaska is heavily timbered with a growth that will eventually be very valuable. The spruce grows eight feet in diameter and more than two hundred feet high; red and yellow cedars abound, usually at some little elevation above the sea. As the exportation of lumber is unlawful the only use of the forests at the present time is for lumber and fuel for the sparse population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The grasses of Alaska flourish to an extraordinary degree in all parts of the country. Wherever the timber is cut away and the undergrowth of ahrubs is kept down, a dense growth of grass soon takes place, to the exclusion of all other plants. Timothy, orchard grass, and blue grass grow to great size. One of the most common native grasses is the Alaskan red top. It is a prominent factor in nearly all grass mixtures and frequently exceeds a man in height. White clover is spreading rapidly. The grass is nutritious, the cattle always becoming sleek and fat during the summer season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Alaskans claim that it is more expensive to make hay on the ground than it is to bring it from San Francisco or Seattle, but this is because of the crude hand-scythe methods employed. A few days’ work in leveling oft the irregular hummocks, so that mowers and horse rakes could lie used, would reduce the cost to a few dollars per ton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The abundance of berries in Alaska has been a subject of remark by everyone who has written regarding this country. The flavor of most Alaskan berries is excellent. They are widely used for food, being put up by the whites in the usual way in preserves, jellies and &quot;cans; among the natives the principal method of preserving them is in seal oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the native plants used to a considerable extent is wild rice, the underground bulbs of which are collected. dried, powdered, and made into a sort of cake. Beach peas grow in many portions of the country. The plants yield abundantly, and the pods are well filled with .-mall, juicy peas about the size of the French </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">peas of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is quite a number of pot herb plants which grow well in Alaska, among which are skunk-cabbage, shepherd's purse, horse-radish, dandelion, and turnip tops. The hardier vegetables of our own garden also do well, such as lettuce, radishes, carrots, parsnips, renian*, peas, snap beans and rhubarb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Potatoes grow, but not to a size desired, although isolated specimens weighing a pound each are to be obtained. In some places cabbage and cauliflower will not head. Samples are frequently seen of the abnormal behavior of beets and turnips, the plants frequently attempting to complete their life cycle in one season. In such cases no enlarged root is formed and the plant runs to seed early. Some varieties of turnip are less subject to this undesirable trait than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The methods of gardening which have been generally employed are very poor. Often a large amount of labor is expended in planting a crop, but one? planted it is allowed to care for itself. Close planting seems to be the rale. Potatoes are generally planted six inches apart in rows separated net more than a foot. The result of such planting 1'3 a thick growth of vines that covers the ground to such an extent that the sun’s rays never reach the ground. It is not surprising that email potatoes result from such planting. Bedding up of the soil is generally practiced. Usually the beds are formed about three or four feet wide and raised as high above the general level as can be done economically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At nearly every Alaskan village some cows, pigs and poultry are kept, while horses are kept at some of the larger places. At several places dairies are maintained, supplies of milk and small quantities of butter being furnished during many months of the year. Pigs thrive exceedingly well but when allowed to ran at large their flesh is liable to acquire a fishy flavor. Protection of live stock from the winter rains is essential, although there is a flock of sheep on one of the islands that has no other shelter than that provided by a net very vigorous growth of spruce trees. The winter range is of little value, as the grasses contain little nutrition after being soaked by the winter rains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In southeastern Alaska, with the exception of the tide flats, land must first be cleared of the dense forest growth, and in some places the deep mess will have to be removed. The spruce stumps must be dug out, as they are very slow in rotting, and not infrequently produce large second-growth timber. In addition to clearing, the land must be thoroughly drained and protected against seepage from above. This ditching and removal of stumps is very laborious and expensive. In the southwestern portion of the country the expense of clearing away the stumps will not be required, nor is draining necessary to the same extent. Lack of markets and transportation facilities retard the agricultural development of the country, but these are being improved gradually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When climatic conditions, topography, soils, etc., of Norway, Iceland, the Orlmey Island-, as well as Scotland, Sweden and Finland, are compared with those of Alaska, it seems probable that what has been accomplished in these European countries can also be done in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Alaska. Rye. oats and barley are grown in sufficient abundance in the licnh of Europe to supply local demands, and also to some extent for export. Cattle, sheep and swine are extensively raised in these countries, sheep doing well in Iceland, which appears less auspicious from an agricultural standpoint than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">Alask</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our hopes for the future of Alaska's agricultural development lie chiefly in the relatively alight climatic clianges which we judge will be required to make the coast country more congenial. This part of the country will naturally bo the first to be developed. But our hopes extend to the furthest limits of the interior. We trust in our God that he has all the means at his disposal, and all the power required, to bring about such climatic changes as will eventually make the whole interior of Alaska “rejoice and blossom as the rose&quot;.—Isaiah 35 :L</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">OLD MAXIMS VALUABLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ANY a FARMER has been laughed at for giving credence to the ancient maxims of the farm, but the United States Department of Agriculture has thought these rural proverbs worthy of an investigation. The result is that many of them have been proved to be the expression of the keen common sense of agriculturists of olden time and worth perpetuating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is difficult in the country to know just the best time to plant different seeds. The old maxims furnish correct information by making comparison with the development of other planrs under local conditions. Beans are best planted when the blackberry bushes blossom. Early gardening may commence when the catkins have formed on the maple trees. At the close of the season warning o' frost is given by the maturing of the cockleburrs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a best time for every farm operation, and this is accurately indicated by some tree, shrub or plant. Scientists have imagined that their “scientific” instruments were superior to anything else, but the Washington researchers arc demonstrating something that the Bible ages ago said might be expected now: “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish [bc_ found comparatively worthless]; and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”—Isaiah 20:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">VEGETARIANISM A SETTLED QUESTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UR Lord ate roast lamb and settled the vegetarian question, and since he knows that human beings require some meat we feci sure he will so arrange matters in the incoming Golden Age that all will have opportunity to get their quota. The distribution of meats is a subject to which any ruler can afford to give profound a; -ention. It is something that touches the interests of every human being except vegetarians and such others as do net wear leather shoes. ।</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">RA T POLICE IN ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NE OF THE good positions today in England is that of Rat Officer, a job that carries a fair salary and possesses the advantage of a free technical education on rats. The British Board of Agriculture is enough interested to hire as a lecturer before the Rat Police a Fellow of the Zoological Society and to call a national conference for their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On account of the vast stores of food and merchandise stored and transported during the war the rat became a factor of national importance. Each rat, it is estimated from their known depredations, costs somebody $1.30 a year, which might easily become a burden too great to be borne by any nation, if the ruts should be allowed to live and multiply unchecked. The rat capacity for propagation is for each pair to raise an annual family of twenty to fifty. A statistician has estimated that a single pair of rats unhindered might multiply into a family of close to a billion children, grandchildren, etc., in five years. This would impose upon the community the unbelievable burden of a billion and a half dollars a year. From this alone the necessity of combatting the rat as one of the worst enemies of man is readily deducible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The rat is said to have the one civic virtue of scavenger for city sewers, but over against that is a long column of liabilities. As a carrier of disease this creature has no equal. There is scarcely a dangerous infectious disease that rats may not carry through a community. It has long been known that they disseminate the germs of trichinosis. In Asiatic countries the rat is dreaded as a carrier of the bubonic plague. Where there are no rats this deadly plague has no chance of spreading with any speed. Rats did their share in the bringing of the germs of tl&gt;e recent black plague—alias influenza—within reach of hundreds of thousands of those that paid the price of life for the infection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Like the plague, the rat originated in China. Both the black rat and the larger brown rat spread over Europe from their Asiatic haunts, the former as much os 600 years ago, and the more ferocious and dangerous brown rat in 1727, when it entered Russia and thence went all over Europe, exterminating it- small cousin as it took possession of rat-land. By ships it has been spread all over the world. The brown variety is one that has the ill fame of occasionally eating babies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In Great Britain these rodent? consume $250,000,000 worth of food annually. In wheat producing countries, as Australia, rats destroy many times their weight of grain, and spoil much more by their unclean nests and by a noisome infection which ruins whole masses of the wheat. The ncoswity of guarding stores of grain against rats is only too well known </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tn</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the American farmer and grain handler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The British plan contemplates making it an offense not to take prescribed measures against rats. The occupier or owner of a property will become liable to a fine of $100 for “neglect to take reasonable and necessary steps to destroy rats and mice or to prevent infestation. It will apply to buildings and other structures on land, sewers, drains and culverts, and to chips and other vessels.” The success of rat-destruction methods appears in the record of the Albert Docks, where now not over fifteen a week are taken in some three miles of docks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In like </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">manner</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">er the rat will finally be exterminated throughout the world, but it will take time. That a time will come when none of these destructive agencies will continue to exist may be understood from the promise: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom, the Golden Age].&quot;—Isaiah 11:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">the fittest survive</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T WAS the evangelists and other clergy that gave a bad name to the theory known as the survival of the fittest. Nevertheless it is a fact that the fittest survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A general misunderstanding of Charles Darwin’s theory caused it to become quite a harmful influence in philosophy. The commonly taught idea was that the great scientist held exclusively that those creatures have the best chance of survival in life’s struggle which are Ilie most powerful and savage and best able to defend themselves and destroy others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As the survival-of-the-fittest theory became the accepted philosophy of most thinking men, and because the tendency of anyone is to live his ideas, there resulted a caste of powerful and influential men who made the principle of force the moving power of practical life. Men's heroes are those that approximate their philosophic ideals, and the great men have been “the mighty men of valor,” true to the type of the survival of the savage and ferocious fittest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Darwin, however, taught also that those creatures had exceedingly bright prospects of survival which, though weak and defenceless individually, acted in masses. Instances of the survival of such groups are the herds of peccaries in South America, of wolves in packs, of buffaloes in herds, of anta and bees. Another example is</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">buildings and streets. The electric railway companies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

There will be no more coal famines in the winter months, as coal will not be needed, and the coal mines can be sealed, and . the coal barons will be checked. Motorists will operate their automobiles without using gasoline.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Good Book says that such blessings are to be divinely given to man that “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him”. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In the Golden Age all men will love God for his goodness and for his matchless character, and it may be that some such invention as -inventor Smith’s may soon appear to inaugurate some of the blessings that are to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FUTURE FOR THE AIRPLANE!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CCORDING to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Aeronatics,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which speaks with</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">British caution, the airship appears to have a great : future for special commerce where time is a dominant factor and the demand and is sufficient to justify a large machine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It has also a great field in the opening up of new -countries where other means of communication are difficult. The only limitation to'size will be the cost of the airship and its sheds, just as in steam vessels it is the cost of the vessels and the cost of deepening the harbors that limit the size of Atlantic liners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Developments of this character generally take place slowly. Otherwise failures occur, as in the case of the Great 'Western. It may be many years before the airship -is increased from its present maximum of 750 to 1,500 feet. If the development is subsidized or assisted by the government, very rapid development may be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In peace time the seaplane, airplane and airship will have their uses. But except for special services of high .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">utility it is questionable whether they will play wore than a minor part as compared with steamship, railway and motor transport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An example of special service was when an Italian soprano, engaged to sing in Paris, missed her train at Milan. She hired an airplane and got to Paris in good time. Another artist flew’ from Paris to Deauville to keep his appointment Herminie Korner, leading lady of the Munich Theater, flew from Munich to the Augsburg Theater and return with two of her company. Joe Labero, an actor, flew from Hanover to the Hamburg Theater and dropped 60,000 dodgers over Hamburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While it is written that men “shall mount up on eagles’ wings” and the present development of the air manhing perhaps sufficiently fulfills this prediction, there are such pronounced limitations on present methods of air transportation, that something else may have to be looked for, for the complete fulfillment of the old Biblical pronouncement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SEAWEED UTILITIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HILE MAN has been busy reaping and consuming the products of the surface of the earth, he has neglected an entire realm of the vegetable world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is estimated that there are some 15,000 varieties of what in ignorance of its life-giving qualities is termed sea “weed”. Only a little attention has been paid to the vegetable growth of the waters, but that has yielded valuable results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The idea has taken root in some astute minds that seaweed may have commercial or money-making possibilities, and with selfishness as a motive, something is being done to make them valuable to humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In Japan the matter has been gone into for some time, and 600,000 Japanese now work in the seaweed industry, turning the water growths into boots, picture frames, marble flooring, electric switchboards and a substitute for cotton. The French seaweed becomes a stiffener for mattresses and a sizing for straw hats. In South Australia it works up into ropes and cord for fishing nets. In Essex, England, seaweed is used for fertilizer, and in other parts of England “laver” is eaten as a vegetable. In Ireland “tope,” eaten hot, becomes a remedy for rheumatism and throat troubles. In America seaweed is employed to regulate the bowels. Now certain varieties are being transformed, with other materials, into bricks for building purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">According to Professor Charles E. Bessey, of the University of Nebraska, seaweeds are classified according to color, and there are many varieties'—1,000 bluegreen slimes, 10,000 green seaweeds, 1,500 brown seaweeds, 2,500 red seaweeds and about 200 stoneworts. Perhaps it was partly in reference to the hitherto un</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">utilized fields of the sea that the Bible predicts that is the Golden Age, “I [God] will multiply the increase of the field.”—Ezekiel 36:30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CHEAP COPPER</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE PROCESS of extracting copper from ore has cost sixteen to twenty cents a pound. It required the stamping of the ore to powder, sometimes its roasting, and then the chemical treatment to separate the metal from minerals composing the ore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A new process, the Green wait, claims to extract the copper directly from the ore at from seven to ten cents a pound. The method is electrolytic and the copper is practically pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Old processes obtain from 65% to 80% of the copper in the ore. By the new method from 77% to 87% is secured. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In ancient Hebrew times the mining and extraction of copper was described poetically: “Stone man melts for copper; he searcheth the stone of thick darkness and of the shadow of death; he hath sunk a shaft far from the wanderer; they that are forgotten of the foot are suspended [in the shaft]; away from man [in the shaft], they waver to and fro; in the flint man hath thrust his hand; he hath overturned mountains from the roots; in the rocks he hath deft channels.* (Job 28:1-11) There were copper mines in the Sinai Peninsula, and on the Red Sea shores were furnaces and the wharves whence the copper was shipped. In later times of persecution Christians were forced to work in the copper mines of that locality.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> GERMAN Government loan of 200,000,000 marks was the basis for the great nitrogen works at Oppau, near Ludwigshafen. The factory will have a-storage capacity of 350,000 tons of ammonia fertilizer, and a daily capacity of 2,800 tons, and will employ 8,000 to 9,000 persons. The first building of the seven to be built, is completely equipped with machinery, and its magnitude may be surmised from the fact that it has 3,500 telephones and has already cost $750,000.</span></p>

Patent* in chemistry never were so active before. Among many recent patents are: a process for separating nitrogen from air, one for the recovery of iodine from residues, and one for the formation of ammonia by means of the electric arc. A process is patented for the electrolytic treatment of tinned scrap, one for a new type of electric furnace, and one for the manufacture of better dry cells.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ALCOHOL IN INDUSTRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN KING Alcohol was dethroned as a beverage last July the annual use of the drug in the United States dropped from 269,000,000 to 100,000.000 gallons, the latter quantity being consumed largely in the various arts, and the difference having been drunk heretofore solely as a beverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is predicted, however, that the time is not far distant when 2,500,000,000 gallons of alcohol will be annually employed in the arts and industries and for motor fuel in automobiles. As the petroleum supply dwindles and the price of gasoline advances to that of alcohol, alcohol will rapidly replace gasoline as a fuel. Even now denatured ethyl alcohol in carload lots is the cheaper. Furthermore, alcohol yields more power to the gallon than gasoline, it does not clog carbureters, it is clean to handle, and does not have a disagreeable odor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are scores of untouched sources of commercial alcohol. Any plant, fruit or grain which can be fermented is a possible spring for the greater stream of the drug which is yet to flow to do the work of man. Palms, corn stalks, sawdust and the cactus are among the articles which can be fermented into some kind of sugar, and the sugar into alcohol. Alcohol may be enthroned again as King—not as a beverage but as a power, in the realm where gasoline now reigns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In olden days alcohol was not known as a separate distillate, and the liquids containing it were noteworthy, or notorious, as intoxicants. Now that the country is legally dry as Sahara, the Biblical warnings against intemperance may be out of date, but they will long serve as reminders of former days: for example, of an England or an America, made “merrie&quot; by its liquors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AFRICA AND THE AIRPLANE</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IR GEORGE LLOYD, Governor of Bombay, is considering a seaplane service between Bombay and Karachi, to be established by New Year. An inland postal service is in hand between Bombay and the other principal cities of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Belgian Government is about to develop commercial aviation on the Congo. There will be regular mail and passenger service between Kinshasa and Stanleyville. The trip will take two days, and the service will start after New Year, with twelve 300-horsepower hydroplanes. Each plane will carry 900 kilos at a speed of 115 to 150 kilometers an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Central Africa missionaries want hydroplanes to take the place of a fleet of launches now running between various mission stations. At inland points landings will be arranged in the straight, smooth central streets of the native towns, which are usually 100 feet wide and cleared of grass and other obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A regular service is operated from France to Morocco, starting at Toulouse, with stops at Barcelona, Alicante, Malaga and Rabat, bringing Rabat two days’ journey from Paris. Passengers and mail leave Paris by the night train and the flight to Rabat, Morocco, takes sixteen hours. A branch line runs to Oran in Algeria. An airplane service is also being arranged from London to British West Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The period of human progress beginning in 1800 is predicted in the Bible as “the day [period] of his preparation”— the preparation for the Golden Age by means of every conceivable improvement that can make for the comfort and well-being of people.—Nahum 2: 3.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N ALBERTA, Canada, the Government ia about to establish a research department to aid in developing the natural resources of the province. It is hoped to built up large industries in coal, oil, natural gas and salt- The Dominion Government has prepared a Directory of Canadian Chemical Industries, giving a summary of the industries devoted to chemistry and their work for the past six years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Nottingham, England, reports that an American inventor has produced a fuel which has been judged worthy of an official test. The new motor fuel is claimed to run an automobile thirty miles for ten cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT IN BIBLE TIMES</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N Bible times the relation between master and servant was very close, despite the fact that these servants were sometimes hundreds in number. Abraham had 318 servants born in his own house, not counting their wives and children. (Genesis 14:14) Job had 22,000 head of live stock and it must have taken many servants to look after these. (Job 42:12) Elisha was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, also implying many servants. (1 Kings 19:19) Yet the customary salutation of an employer to his servants was &quot;The Lord be with you”, and the customary reply of the servant was. “The Lord bless thee”. (Ruth 2:4) modern methods of demands, curt refusals, violence, machine guus, etc., do not point the way to the Golden Age. Wiser counsel must prevail, and it will prevail, in due time, for the time will come when the groaning creation, now reaching blindly after better things, shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into a glorious liberty from sin and every evil thing.— Romans 8:19-22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NOTES ON INFLUENZA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New York Medical Journal</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> publishes an interesting item concerning the causes of infection from influenza. Instead of susceptibility to influenza being particularly affected by antiseptic applications to the nose and throat, the ruling consideration is the vitality of the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the United States Navy a hundred men volunteered for exhaustive tests. These men were in the best state of health and were kept so during the period of experiment. They were subjected to every possible mode of infection- Live influenza bacilli were sprayed hourly into their noses and throats. They were fed germs with their food. They were kept in close contact in almost every conceivable way with influenza patients, sleeping with them, eating with them, breathing the same air, and vigorously trying to get the disease. In spite of all efforts, not one of this hale and hearty group of sailors contracted the “flu”. This experiment is advanced as strong proof of the theory that the contracting of influenza is principally a question of strong or weakened condition of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The medical publication </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Eygeia</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> publishes notes on the experience with influenza in the common school in Stockholm, Sweden. The school had 711 pupils of whom 419 contracted the disease. So far as a careful study of the record goes, the spread of the disease among the pupils in the school was almost at the same rate as the average spread throughout the city. In consequence it is not considered worth while to close the schools because the fact that the pupils are together in the school does not produce more danger from the disease than if they were at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">IMMUNITY TO &quot;FLU&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BOARD SHIP, or wherever sleeping quarters are confined, the chances of influenza infection are high. A battleship crew sleep with limited cubic space where proper ventilation is impossible, like the conditions in a crowded city tenement Even in a hospital ward, with ten feet between bed centers, influenza spreads, but in ships where hammocks are two feet apart says the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">London Lancet,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the chances of infection are 125 times as great as where the sailors Lie “head-to-foot” fashion, for infection risk varies as the cube of the distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Immunity depends on personal vitality. In the case of several medical men who had been immune for months, each succumbed to the disease two days after a well defined lowering of vitality: in two cases the cause was a long journey; in another the taking of too much alcohol; in the fourth a long walk after the long confinement aboard ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Anything that lowers vitality may open the doors to a prompt attack of “flu”. The exhaustion may come from a drug, from constipation, from indigestible food, from staying up too late, from overworking or exercising, from a fit of passion, from badly ventilated lodging, working or sleeping rooms, or from poor or under nutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Immunity to influenza ranges from almost none in the under-nourished of war countries to the almost complete immunity of the athlete. It will reach 100 per cent in the perfect human beings who will be developed in the Golden Age. It will then be true, as the Bible says, “The Lord will give strength unto his people.”—Psalm 29:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">PREVENTION OF PESTILENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE REGULATION and prevention of great epidemics is interestingly discussed in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">London</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19191126_files/g_E_19191126-13.png" alt="" style="width:13pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lancet,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the leading British medical journal. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lancet </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is concerned over the inability of the profession to handle the influenza pestilence. It asks the question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Can the great epidemics of disease which from time to time sweep over the earth be prevented by human effort?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“When the recent truly terrible epidemic of influenza—we use the words deliberately, for the deaths outnumbered Immeasurably those caused by four and a half years of the greatest war In history—swept over the world, howtnanr were saved from Its attacks by individual or communal measures of precaution? The medical profession cannot claim that the course of the epidemic was seriously affected, much less stayed, by any such measures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“In the history of epidemics, influenza took Its origin In a region somewhere near the Russian border of Turkestan, spreading along the trade routes ns transportation moved.' The epidemic focus of influenza is somewhere on the Eastern border of Russia. It Is not too much for a reconstructive medical profession to conceive the clearing up of a region, which by Its inaccessibility and its neglect has every twenty-five or thirty years originated waves of disease spreading over the globe. But this evidence is restricted to one particular outbreak of the &lt;1 teener The so-called Spanish Influenza of 1918-19 arose we know not where. The records do not show the same dear progress from onn well-defined center to the rest of the globe. The interests at stake and the rewards of success tn preventing even one single pandemic, such as that of 1888 or 1918, are on too colossal a scale for a policy of despair</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Preventative medicine can proudly claim to have opened the eyes of modern statesmen and administrators to the overwhelming importance to the state of the people, of dealing seriously with the problems of disease prevention. Today large, costly and far-seeing measures with this object occupy a place in practical politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;We like to picture a world where the prevention and eradication of all disease tlint can be prevented or eradicated should be the nlm—even the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">flrtt</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> alm—of national and international policy and effort; where measures having us their object the saving of millions of human lives would be thought as worthy of a groat statesman's energies and of the interest of the public ns Free Trade, bimetallism and the nationalization of the railways. When the smoke and noise of war have cleared away, and the nations are really at peace again, the statesmen of the world could find no higher or more stimulating aim for their energies thou the cleansing Of epidemic breeding grounds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The problem of the M. D. s is real and great, and their purpose is good, but it would be better if they forgot the “proudly” part, because &quot;Pride goeth before destruction.” (Proverbs 16:18) Evidently the cleansing of pestilence foci depends upon worldwide good government, and that cannot be expected until the coming Golden Age ushers in the Kingdom of God. Then all disease will gradually be banished, and humanity built up in vitality until it will be impossible for germs or bacteria to find a feeding ground in weakened tissue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">VOLCANOES TO BLAME?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19191126_files/g_E_19191126-14.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE MEDICAL profession has an idea. Every conceivable source for the “flu&quot; had been raked over, but it has required a “scientist” to blame the pestilence of 1918 on the volcanoes. There was an eruption of Mount Kloet in Java recently which wiped out some thousands of natives, and years ago Krakatoa exploded and filled the upper air with the volcanic dust </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">caused the brilliant sunsets of 1883. This proves that there have been great volcanic eruptions, which must be the first premise in establishing the blame for the “flu&quot; on the volcanoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The “scientists” say that they do not know, and cannot be sure, and that “sufficient time has not elapsed” and probably it might be added that they never will know, but they ask respectful consideration for the idea that in some unexplainable and disconnected wav the thoroughly heat-sterilized contents of the volcanoes distributed throughout the atmosphere may be, or might be, responsible for the untold suffering and grief of pestilence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The theory is again that the poison gases let loose over “No Man's Land” were carried everywhere by the winds and caused the “flu” in Spain, Germany, England, France, South America, Africa, Asia and the United States. Of course, there were rains to wash the air dean from these poisons and keep them from being carried worldwide. But no supposition is insignificant enough to prevent a &quot;scientist” from building a world-reforming theory upon it. The &quot;scientific” conclusion is that “another war would be followed by a widespread pestilence, and every effort should be made to avert wars by the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The truth about the black plague pestilence is that Europe was flooded with Asiatics who were infected but immune to the pneumonic plague, and that when the infection spread it found an unusually large number of persons in a low state of vitality owing to the world scarcity of food. Poison gases and volcanoes probably had nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Science is a useful handmaid of society when it confines itself to facts. But the divine opinion of some of it is as when Paul speaks of “science falsely so called&quot; (1 Timothy 6:20), and “The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.”—1 Corinthians 3:19.</span></p>

This, according to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medical Record,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> includes problems in hygiene in the war territory that, on account of the thoroughness of German “frightfulness”, are novel and difficult-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many French wells, contrary to rules of civilized warfare, have been poisoned in a variety of ways. Here the water itself must be actually disinfected by means of ozone or a process known as javelization. The inhabitants are advised to boil the water they use, and where they desire to reoccupy their properties on devastated land, are counseled to dig deep artesian wells so as to avoid the perils to health of the drinking of polluted surface water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—</span></p>

Malaria is a menace, and the land has to be thoroughly and deeply drained. Exposed surfaces are being disinfected, and insect life destroyed, which might become a menace to human health by touching infected places and communicating the infection to the people. Old latrines, dung heaps, stables and daughter houses receive special attention, that the soil where they have been may become fit again for human beings to live on. for children to play on and for the raising of food. In some places there are subterranean passages and dugouts, which of course have become filled with water which is anything but safe for</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19191126_files/g_E_19191126-16.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For eight years there has been a great prevalence of diseased tonsils and adenoid growths in children, which require removal by surgical operations that are both painful and expensive. It is right and necessary that these should be removed in order to enable the children to develop in growth and prevent diseased or weakened conditions for life. Prevention is much better than a cure however, especially since the surgical operations must quite frequently be repeated one or more times in after years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Even years ago it was known by some people that the use of pacifiers by babies is one of the chief causes of diseased and enlarged tonsils and adenoid growths, which result from the suction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tonsils are a necessity to the body, especially to growing children, as they supply a fluid secretion. The tonsils are an indicator of the condition of the body. When they are diseased the body is out of condition, which results most frequently either from over eating or from not getting the right kind of foods. Too much milk is not good; for it is too rich a food, unless the child is older and gets plenty of exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By removing the causes the tonsils will heal, unless there is a tenseness of the muscles of the neck leading to those parts. This trouble can be corrected by a graduate osteopath or chiropractor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Diseased tonsils arc alone sufficient cause for adenoid growths. These growths are also caused by mothers not sufficiently cleansing the baby's nostrils, thus causing a gathering of matter and an irritated condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Catarrh, which results from an aggravated cold when the system is out of condition, is another cause of adenoid growths. In fact anything that irritates the tonsils and those parts of the nose, such as whooping cough, long hard crying spells, etc, will cause adenoid growths and diseased tonsils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Children who suffer with catarrhal colds should be taught how to elennse the nasal passages convenientlv and efficiently, and this is something many adults do not know. The process is extremely simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Into a cup of warm water, quite warm to the touch but not hot, sprinkle enough salt to give it a mildly salt taste. Then using the hand as a receptacle snuff the solution thoroughly up first one nostril and then the other until some of it runs down the throat. Expel the contents of the nose and repeat until fully cleansed. Follow by gargling the throat with the same solution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shortage of milk in Italy appears from the fact that • during the war ninety-three per cent of the cattle were j killed to feed the families of Italian soldiers. The influenza epidemic caused the death of over a million persons and left innumerable nursing babies behind, thousands of whom have died from lack of nourishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is reported that unless very large quantities of milk are sent to Italy, another year will see very few babies alive in that country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LL KINDS of germicides are employed by people who ere zealous for health via germlessness, but according to the Philadelphia Tuberculosis Committee the best one is common soap. Soap, of course, removes dirt, but it took a “scientist&quot; to make a culture of the external contents of unwashed and of washed hands, and to announce that by far the greater number of germs ' were removed with the dirt However, says the Committee, a single splash in soapy water is not adequate but the hands must be diligently and frequently scrub- / bed, effectually enough to visibly remove the soiled condition, in order to be safeguarded against tubercular infection. It is heroic treatment to “wash and be clean&quot;, but perhaps worth while, particularly if the old saw were true that “cleanliness is next to godliness.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">MILLIONS NOW LIVING WILL NEVER DIE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Verily, verily, I ray unto yon, if a man keep my saying, be shall never die.&quot;—John 8:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE INQUIRING mind naturally asks: Why should man see death at all? Is it not possible for him to live everlastingly ? Not understanding why death has ravaged the human race and what remedy Jehovah has provided against it, the many have concluded that death has always prevailed among men and men will always die. An understanding of the Scriptures clarifies the subject entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord created but one man—Adam. All the works</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of Jehovah are perfect. (Deuteronomy 32:4) Man was - mated in the image and likeness of God and Jehovah i gave him dominion over the things of earth. (Genesis 1: 26-28) The first man, Adam, being perfect in organism and having a perfect wife, Eve, and the right to propagate his race and fill the earth, not only had life and liberty and happiness himself but could have maintained the same for all of his offspring had he been obedient to Jehovah. God had informed him that a violation of his law would result in the loss of everything he had. The Genesis account is that God told Adam that death would result from disobedience of the divine command. Man did violate God’s law and was sentenced to die, the formal pa <sup>r</sup>' of the judgment reading: “For dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return.” , To enforce this judgment of death God separated Adam from his perfect home, Eden, deprived him of the perfect food which grew there, caused him to feed upon the ■ poisonous elements of the earth, and thus the death sentence was executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The perfect man Adam begat no children, but while undergoing the sentence of death he exercised his procnative powers and there were born of Adam and Eve children. They inherited the imperfections resulting to their parents by reason of the death sentence. “As by the disobedience of one man [Adam] sin entered into the world, and death by sin, so death has passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12) Thus the whole race came under legal condemnation, and thus unrigTiding Gqd’s arrangement we can appreciate the words of the Psalmist: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.”— Psalm 51:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This judgment of death being justly inflicted by Jehovah for a violation of his law could never ba reversed by him, and unless he made some provision for the relief of mankind, the whole race ulttmatelv would go into death and there would be no resurrection—no hope </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">them in the future. God promised, however, that he would redeem man from death. Through the prophet he said: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.”—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since a perfect man had sinned and brought dearth upon the race, nothing but the life of a perfect man could satisfy that judgment; and since all of the human race were imperfect, therefore “none of them could by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.”—Psalm 49:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus in his prehuman existence was the Logos, and in order to carry out the Father’s will his life was transferred from spirit to human. “God rending his own Son in the likeness of siuful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” (Romans 8:3) He was rich in heavenly glory, wisdom and power, and though he was rich “yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” (2 Corinthians 8:9) The human race had lost the right to life, and all were going into death. When Jesus came he said: “I am acme that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10) “The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” (Matthew 20:28 “We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”—Hebrews 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The death and resurrection of Jesus provided* *a ransom or purchase price for the entire human race. Then in God’s due time every one of Adam’s race, the living and the dead, must know this fact and have a chance to accept the benefits of it. “For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will bare all men to be saved [from the condemnation of death by the ransom sacrifice], and to come unto the knowledge of the truth- For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men. the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">testified</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in due </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">time.”</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1 Timothy 2:8-6) This ransom price for Ute purchase of mankind from death was provided nearly 1.800 years ago. But men have continued to die for the reason it was not God’s due time to begin to offer them life. “God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name.... And after this I will return, and build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen clown; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: that the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the nations upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.&quot;— Acts 15: 14-1?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah made a promise to faithful Abraham, saying, &quot;In thy seed shall all the families of the earth bo blessed.” The seed of Abraham is the Christ, Jesus the Head and the church his body. (Galatians 3:16, ST. 29; Colcssians 1: 18) From the time of the death and resurrection of Jesus until his second coming is the time in which God has visited the nations of the earth and had the Gospel preached as a witness, according to Jesus’ prophetic statement, in order that those who heard and made a full consecration to do Jehovah's will and remain obedient unto their covenant might thus be gathered out from among men, and with the great King, Christ Jesus, constitute the promised seed of Abraham, through which the blessings will come to mankind under Messiah's reign. There will not be a great number of these. Jesus himself is authority for saying that it will be just a little flock, a comparatively small number. (Luke 13:32) Only those who, during the Gospel age and before the setting up of his kingdom, make a full consecration and prove themselves overcomers have the promise of immortality, the promise of joint heirship with Christ Jesus in his kingdom— Revelation 2:10; 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For many years good, honest men and women hare asked, What hope is there for me of getting life everlasting? The church systems, through their creeds, have answered this question in this wise: Catholicism said: Only a very few die and go to heaven. The majority of Catholics at death must spend a long period in purgatory, and there is a chance of these being afterwards transferred from purgatory to heaven, and all the others must spend their eternity in fire and brimstone, being tormented forever- The answer of the creeds of the various Protestant systems is really worse. According to their theory no purgatory even is provided. There is no hope of life everlasting in happiness according to their theory except for those who become members of the church and die and go to heaven. All others must spend eternity being tormented by fireproof devils. Is there any wonder that reasonable, sensible men have rejected the churches, rejected the Bible, and even turned against God? Forced to believe that this was the only provision made, they have disregarded all Biblical teaching. This has been a great mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Entering the Twentieth Century great truths are being unfolded to mankind. The progress in invention, science and education in general is more marked in this century than ever before, and with it has come a greater enlightenment of people concerning the Bible, because the time is due. And now : tv.d'uits of the Scriptures are finding out that the Bible means c.vactly what it says: r.cnuly. that Jehovah provided through the death ar.d resurrection of Jesus a purchase price for all men, and in God’s due time a knowledge of this fact must be brought to all, &quot;Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man [Christ Jesus] whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath giv&lt;_n assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.”—Acts 17:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When are these previous promises due to be fulfilled ? Referring to the article in our last issue concerning the end of the world, we quote again the words of the Master: &quot;And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name.” (Revelation 11:18) Clearly, then, many of these great truths are now due to be understood, because the old order is passing away and the new order is coming in. Jesus taught, and every one of his disciples emphasized, his second coming and the establishment of his kingdom. One of them, referring to that glorious time, wrote: &quot;Times of refreshing shall come from the face of the Lord [Jehovah], and he will send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the heavens must retain until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3:19-21) Therefore the time must come when there shall be offered to mankind the blessings of being restored to the conditions that Adam enjoyed defore he sinned; namely, perfection of body and of mind, and perfection of conditions surrounding him, insuring his peace and lasting happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Are we near the fulfillment of that prophecy ? Note again the answer of Jesus concerning the end of the world: &quot;For then shall there be great tribulation such as was not since the beg</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">innin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be- And except those days should be shortened, there should be no flesh saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.”— Matthew 24: 21, 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This saying of Jesus is subject to only one interpretation; namely, that the old order will completely pass away by the greatest time of trouble the world has ever known; that there will never be another such time of trouble; that it will be ao great that all the human race would perish from the earth unless the Lord would cause it to be shortened, but for his elect’s sake, namely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">those whom he has elected or taken out of the world—the Lord Jesus and the true Christians—for the sake of such those days will be shortened and will therefore result in many human beings passing through this time of trouble without dying. Why should the Lord permit J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any to escape death in that time of trouble unless he</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected to do them some good? Why say for the elect’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sake that he is going to shorten the time, and thus save * many from death? There </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">enn</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> be but one conclusion* ' The elect constitute the seed of Abraham according to &lt;&nbsp;the promise, through which blessing shall be ministered , to the remainder of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mankind</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">d. Therefore God would spare some to pass through this time of trouble that the ■ elect might begin the reconstruction work of the human family, first with those who remained on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again referring to the great time of trouble that is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> now afflicting mankind, the prophet of the Lord wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And it shall come to pass that in all the land, saith the * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third shall be left therein. And I will bring the third</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">part through the fire [the fiery trouble], and will refine</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The Lord is my God.” (Zechariah 13:8,9) Why bring a part of the people through the fiery trouble unless it is God’s purpose to give them a chance to accept the blessings k, that shall be ministered through Christ? Clearly this is the purpose; for he says these will hear </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and will became his people and be obedient to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Again, the prophet of the Lord, speaking concerning those who love righteousness in this time, said: &quot;Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver , him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">and keep him alive,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and he shall be blessed upon the earth [not in heaven]: and thou wilt not deliver </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> unto the , will of his enemies.&quot; (Psalm 41:1, 2) This is a wonderful incentive for men in this hour of great disturbance and distress to be considerate of the poor and afflicted, to deal righteously with their neighbors, to live in peace and honor the Lord. Such are the ones that are promised deliverance in the time of trouble. Those who seek meekness and righteousness and avoid turmoils are specially promised protection in the time of trouble. —Zephaniah 2:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Referring again to the same great stress upon the world and what shall follow thereafter, the prophet of Jehovah said: &quot;Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will.I turn to the people a pure message, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent’’ (Zephaniah 3: 8,9) Why turn to the people a pure message after this time of trouble is over unless God intends that the people should profit by it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many children have been left fatherless in this time of war and revolution, and with comfort the Lord’s prophet says: &quot;Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.&quot;— Jeremiah 49:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After those who pass through the time of trouble have been ministered unto and given the opportunities of blessings by the Messiah, then those who have slept in their graves in death shall be awakened and given a knowledge of the truth. That will be'their “due time” to hear the message concerning the ransom- “Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in which all in their graves shall hear his [Christ Jesus’] voice and shall come forth; they that have done good unto a resurrection of life; and they that have done evil [and all who have gone into death have done evil] unto a resurrection [restanding to life] by judgments.&quot; (John 5:38,29, Revised Version) &quot;There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.” (Acts 24:15) &quot;Christ is risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man [Adam] came death, so by man [Christ Jesus] came also the resurrection of the dead. For as all in Adam die, even so all in Christ shall be made alive. But every man in his own order.” (1 Corinthians 15:20-23) The apostle then proceeds to show that the Messiah &quot;must reign until he hath put all enemies under his feel The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It will be during the reign of the glorious Messiah that the following text will be fully realized: “If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.&quot; It cannot be said that man, in the true senae, lives until he has the legal right to live, and the legal'xight to live will come to him only when it is offered as a gracious gift through Christ Jesus, as the Apostle stipulates* (Romans 6:23; 5:18,19) Jesus declared: “And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.&quot; (John 11:26) This Scripture must have a fulfillment, and the time for the beginning of its fulfillment is the beginning of restitution times, which commence with the reign of the Messiah. The old order being dead and passing away, and the new coming in, there are millions of persons on this earth now who will pass through that trouble and who, obeying the Lord’s righteous rale, shall never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The prophet Job has given us a beautiful picture of this arrangement for the restoration of mankind. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">describes a man who is aged and rick; and there is brought to him a knowledge of the great ransom. He believes and accepts the Lord’s teaching and obeys the righteous rule and is restored to his youth, and his flesh becomes fresher than that of a child. Mark this beautiful Scripture: “He keepeth baek his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. He [man] is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers- If there be a messenger with him [one to deliver to him the message of salvation through the ransom sacrifice], an interpreter [one who interprets to him and explains the Scriptures], one among a thousand to show unto man his [the Lord’s] uprightness: then he [the Lord] is gracious unto him [man], and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I [says the man] have found a ransom [a purchaser]. His flesh shall become fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth. He shall pray unto God and he will be favorable unto him: he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.”—Job 33:18-27,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">St. John, the follower of the Lord Jesus, was convicted of the alleged crime of sedition and banished to the Isle of Patmos. While he was there aa a convict in a rock quarry, the Lord visited him and gave him a wonderful mental virion of the blessings to come. St. John saw the incoming of the Golden Age, and sublimely described it thus: “And I saw a new heaven [invisible ruling power of the Christ] and a new earth [new organized society on earth] : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away [the old order of things perished]: and there was no more sea [no more radical, Anarchistic element]. And I John saw the holy city [symbolic of Messiah’s kingdom], the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband [thus describing the righteous kingdom of the Lord, the Messiah taking possession of the things of earth]- And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle [dwelling place] of God is with men [on earth, not in heaven], and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things have passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.”— Revelation 21:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In this glorious reign of Christ the great enemy, of death, will be destroyed- When there is no more death to ravage humankind the peoples of earth will live in joy, in happiness, in peace forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">THE MODERN FAIRY LAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AIRYLAND is a country inhabited by little children and fairies; but most of us left it some yean ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It takes a poet to show us again the fairyland we lire in-It seems like some dream to look from the editorial offices of The Golden Ace across shining waters to the wonderful sky line of New York, changing hourly with a newness of tint, of shadow and light, with tier on tier of stars by night, and sometimes resplendent with the '' glory of the setting sun—never the same, and always inviting one to fairyland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It was the poetical Lord Dun say who recently spoke in New York, on ••The Land of My Dreams'’ and gave the poet's view of the city:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The first impression your city made upon me was of its symmetry and scientific crderliness. I saw the great buildings with their windows in regular rows, and I thought they were completely under tho dominance of logic, and could not enter into the realm of fabrics. Rut at sunset time on the first evening I looked on the Wool-worth Tower, and it was as if twilight had hidden the base of a great mountain, and only the summit was revealed with its incredible precipices lifting their inscrutable beacons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">____ Marked appreciation of the beautiful is not a gift given in great measure to all, for life is too hard, and the struggle for bread takes the energy, and. leaves little for appreciation of the wonders of our beautiful world. But the time of the Golden Age is at hand, when it will be given to all to open wide their eyes and see the tender beauty and the glorious majesty of creation. Man will have the opportunity to become godlike—to do as the ’ prophet Job suggests, ‘•'Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency, and array thyself with glory and beauty.” —Job 10:10*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">TRAVELERS’ RISKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N EXPERIMENT by some boys yielded results of value to any traveler by automobile- They tried to sec how close they could let a train ger to them before they got off the track Lut they stood on the other track. It was practically impossible to estimate the time, for in nearly every instance the train would have struck them. Few if any adults have any conception of the speed with which a fast-approaching train covers the ground. At sixty miles an hour it goes eighty-eight feel a second, and is upon a person on the track before ho can get out of the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many of the automobile accidents at crossings occur at places which are well protected with bells or other signals, or are open to the view of the autoist. It is not the driver’s indifference to danger, his determination to get by first, his slowness in working the mechanism nor his excitement and confusion, but his inability to esti-mate the speed of the oncoming train that brings disaster. The train is usually upon him in a shorter time than he thinks it can be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The higher in the scale of perfection a man is the more balanced bis faculties, and among other things the greater the check that prudanee puts upon ambition and haste. in the age which will soon open there will be plenty of time for men to learn thoroughly things they now neglect, for the new age will bring to man a constantly lengthening lifetime, until at last life’s vista— in conditions contributing to perfect enjoyment—will stretch out without end. Who would willingly die, when so grent an opportunity is before him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">MORE ACCIDENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> CONNECTICUT farmer recently yawned, broke his jaw, and went to the hospital. Connecticut seems to be a dangerous State, for another man there was trying to open a fruit jar for his wife, and broke his wrist. Still another was grinding meat for a meat pic, when the handle of the grinder flew off and fractured his knee cap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An accident may happen anywhere. A pin prick with the resultant septic poisoning is common. Others that have often happened are. the falling of plaster from the ceiling; the dropping of an inkwell or a pair of-shears from the eleventh story of a building- Falls in bath tubs are quite ordinary accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In one instance a man was lying on a couch in his heme; the rising wind blow the curtain against the gas jet. which set lire to the curtain and then to the man's clothes-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No person can claim to be immune, or can get into a place where he is immune from exposure to accidental </span><span class="font7">injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In New York an overhead trolley wire broke, fell into a passing automobile and severely burned and shocked four men-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Seme workmen were stirring boiling tar on a paving job. An automobile with two occupants approached-A bumble bee stung the driver. The machine hit the kettle of tar, tippet! it over, scattered the tar, and badly burned the workmen.</span></p>
