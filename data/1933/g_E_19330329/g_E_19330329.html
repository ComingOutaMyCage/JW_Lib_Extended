<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Will Hector Charlesworth, Canadian Radio Censor, Drown?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TT IS a task for an honest and truthful man to have to say anything about such an individual as Hector Charlesworth, Canada’s Radio Dictator. No self-respecting, decent man could have written such billingsgate as appeared in the Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday TSTight</span><span class="font5"> of August 6, 1927, at which time he was its editor-in-chief.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Charlesworth probably wrote the article entitled “Visiting Orators Take Notice”, reproduced in our issue of March 15. The mental level of one who would refer to Jehovah God as “the tribal god of the Bussellites” and W’ho would refer to a man like Judge Rutherford as “a heavy- jowled flannel-mouth, Grand Vizier of the 'Russellites’ ”, a judge “perhaps of cigars, perhaps of fat swine”, a “wandering orator”, “wandering blatherskite”, “professional liar”, “lying demagogue”, speaks for itself. It pains us to notice him at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Charlesworth’s apperceptions are plainly indicated in a sentence which is contained in the article in question. In it he says :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Never have conditions been so good for the poor; never at any time in the history of mankind was labor so well rewarded, never was so much practical philanthropy practiced for the care of the weak and needy, never was so much capital freely available for the care and comfort of the underprivileged. Only a fool or a liar could deny these facts. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very well! Let them stand. And let all mankind judge who is the fool and the liar, and the human polecat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But hold! We have something of direct interest on this question of liars. In the first place, truthful men are not selected as censors. It is a dirty job, and only dirty men will take it or do the dirty work that has to be done. It would be inconceivable that a man like Hector</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Charlesworth would take a job as radio censor for Canada (and as his very first act, arbitrarily, w i t h o u t any hearings, order off the air the man who has several times had the honor of the very greatest radio broadcasts in history) without being a crass liar, fit only to associate with clergymen—men designated in the Scriptures as “men of corrupt </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">minds&quot;,</span><span class="font5"> incapable of thinking honestly or truthfully. And such he evidently is.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Who Is the Liar?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As to why Judge Rutherford’s transcriptions were ordered off the air in Canada, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph Journal</span><span class="font5"> of Saint John, N. B., said: “Hector Charlesworth, chairman of the radio commission, stated a dignified complaint had been received from a group of Anglican clergymen in Saint John.” But in a wire to D. R. P. Coats, CJRW, Fleming, Saskatchewan, Charlesworth said, “We have had no complaints of Bible Students’ programs,” denying that the Rutherford transcriptions had been banned “at the instance of the clergy”. Lying comes easy to a man that could write such an article as “Visiting Orators Take Notice”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is no wonder to us that Axel Nielsen, in his letter to Charlesworth, dated January 23, 1933, and published in our issue of March 15, 1933, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I used to admire you in the way one might admire the Devil for his ingenuity, no matter what I might think otherwise of either you or the Devil, for the hypocritical narratives in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font4"> written or selected by yourself. They must have been hard to write; for such things do not come from the heart, but rather must they spring from a taskmaster like gold, or the degradingly pleasant feeling of going downstream without effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In his delineation of the sheet over which Charlesworth presided before being elevated to the position of Canadian Radio Dictator, Mr. Nielsen described it as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A weekly whose financial section is dominated by the crowd which is persecuting James Harpel, and the same War Babies who have secured control of Canadian finance, industry and insurance. The editorial portion of this paper, a front page feature, devotes itself zealously to the furtherance of all the forgotten bunk of kings and tyrants, class and privilege. As for the rest, it consists mainly of social chatter, marriages, photos of socially prominent persons, and all the snobs parade of these classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point one would fain close both nostrils with the thumb and finger of the left hand and with the other take the tongs and drop overboard this “King Canute of Canada in 1933” that is illustrated in the cartoon from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press Evening Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> of Winnipeg which adorns the first page of this article. But it is a libel against old King Canute to compare him to Charlesworth without saying something in his defense.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>We Apologize to the Old Fraud</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is true that old Canute, the first Danish king of England, murdered his own brother-inlaw, but kings are liable to be playful like that. But his kowtowing to the “pope” was because he did not know any better, while Charlesworth’s feigned obeisance to the clergy is merely that of a fawning hypocrite. He knows they are not honest; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">everybody</span><span class="font5"> knows it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canute was quite some ruler. He issued the first national coinage of Denmark and published the first written code of Danish law. It is true, however, that he raised the clergy to a separate estate in the Danish realm, thus fastening those bloodsuckers on the necks of the Danish people. Also, he started the Danish nobility, another gang of frauds, and made them into his highest court of justice. He was a crook, all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not a half-bad concept that likened Charlesworth to King Canute. The old gent, it will be remembered, was so accustomed to ordering everybody around, and insisting that they obey him instanter, that he kept court one day down by the sea, and ordered the waves not to rise around his throne. He would have drowned if somebody with more sense had not dragged him away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But now, turning for the moment away from the old fraud that has been dead for nine hundred years, we consider what may be the fate of this modern copy of the more noble original. We pass up the fact that radio waves from the United States continue to pour into Canada, laden with the truth as it is stored up in Judge Rutherford’s transcriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What interests us just now is the statement of Jehovah God through the prophet Amos as to what He intends to do with His enemies, and we recognize Hector Charlesworth as one of these. He might repent, if there be anything in him to which to make an appeal, but the man is sunk so low that any such appeal seems useless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God knows what He will do with this man if he does not repent; and while we do not know Charlesworth will be such till the last, yet he is such now, and we have a perfect right here to cite the fate which awaits him if he so continues. Here is what Jehovah has to say about what He will measure out to His enemies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>God Will Drown His Enemies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font4"> saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: and though they hide themselves in the top of [Mount] Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: and though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. And the Lord God of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</span><span class="font4"> It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; [Jehovah] is his name.—Amos 9:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That this is not a literal drowning is at once apparent from the clause which says that “though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them<sup>-</sup>’. This drowning of the Devil’s organization, and those that go to make it up, is an overwhelming of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First it will be overwhelmed with the truth, which water so nicely represents, and then the truth will be backed up with infinite power. ‘The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the glory of God as the waters cover the sea.’ In the midst of that knowledge, while it is all-pervasive in the earth, the Devil and his organization will be destroyed; they will go down to rise no more. They will be “drowned”. “They shall be as though they had not been.” The earth will be purified by their removal from it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Honest Men Want It Done Now</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Honest men want the Devil and his crowd “drowned” now. They pray for that every day when they pray, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.’ They would not single out Charlesworth and pray that God would put an end to him; nor would they single out the three clerical sons of dogs (Isaiah 56:10,11) who are supposed to have incited him to his recent act of tyranny. It would be asking too much of the Creator to directly invite His attention to such. He knows who His enemies are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But now’ that we are living in the Judgment Day, honest men cannot help crying out to justice to remove from the scene the human polecats that have so vitiated the atmosphere. A polecat with his collar turned backward knows how to do just one thing, and it is something the rest of us can get along nicely without. “Drowning,” literal or figurative, is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it was from a full heart that William Brown of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, wrote to the Winnipeg </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the Editor.— It is my belief that less injury would be done to Canada if the dignified Anglican clergymen who asked for the suppression of the addresses of Judge Rutherford over the radio, and the radio commission members, were drowned, rather than that Rutherford should be suppressed as an “antisocial agitator”. If that act is approved the liberty and freedom of the individual in Canada has been crucified. “I may not believe a word you say, but </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">will defend with my life, if need be, your right to say it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should not be thought from this that Mr. Brown is savagely wishing to wreak vengeance on anybody. Xot at all. He is probably one of those that pray continually for God’s kingdom to fully come. Quite likely he often ponders, for his own encouragement, the statement that “for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil” (1 John 3:8) and he is anxious for this part of the Kingdom work to begin in his own day. It is a natural and a proper wish, but, if necessary, we can stand the polecats a while longer, until the time comes to bury them, and fumigate the place where they once were.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Men of Medieval Minds</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The true glory of the polecat mind was back in the days of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. Then anybody who questioned the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ipse dixits</span><span class="font5"> of the clergy was promptly boiled in oil, or burned at the stake, torn apart or cut up, bit by bit. Charlesworth would have been a valuable man in those days. He would have done the dirty work, while Reverends McKim, Martin and Steward would have gladly stood by with stop watches in their hands, to momentarily arrest the work of torture when it should appear that the victim was about to be released from his agonies by death. Gentle souls! A polecat presents one of the meekest appearances of any woodland creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Canadian people, especially the western Canadians, do not relish having their thinking done for them by men like Charlesworth, McKim, Martin and Steward. They would like to do some of it themselves. As the Winnipeg </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Free Press</span><span class="font5"> says: “The best and safest plan for the Commission is to make up its mind that it is dealing with a free people and, therefore, despite any ideas in high places as to what is good for the license holders, will proceed to present as many facets as possible of world opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A subscriber of the Winnipeg </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font5"> expresses the matter very well:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To the Editor of The Tribune. Sir,— Re the lectures by Judge Rutherford. The last three lines of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">report in yesterday's issue of the Tribune state, or rather Mr. Charlesworth states, that there has been no complaint as to the electrical transcriptions of Judge Rutherford. Now, the question is, just who is this individual who assumes the responsibility of putting a ban on the lectures of one of the most interesting, also the greatest interpreter of the Scriptures on the continent, if not in the world? lie does not attack any religions, but as his reference to such he quotes only the Bible, book, chapter and verse, let it hurt who it may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As for his attacking governments, he surely does not favor his own country, the U. S. A., and as for Canada, well, we Canadians are glad he is not listening to certain things in our own country. So much for the governments: but Mr. Charlesworth should be informed that Judge Rutherford’s lectures are more eagerly awaited than nine-tenths of the programs broadcast on this continent. And again I question, or rather we question, his authority in holding them up. In the one block in which I live we are all interested in the explanation of the actions of those who assumed the authority of putting a ban on the lectures of Judge Rutherford, not the Bible Society.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From Judge Rutherford’s gifted pen we herewith repeat some of the statements on this subject which appear in his article entitled “Important Notice”, which constitutes the leading article in our issue of March 1, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the official representatives of the seventh world power must first approve what is broadcast by radio, then the people may be assured that those powers will approve nothing that carries to the people the truth concerning the present unhappy condition and what is the remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the Anglo-American empire system, or ‘ ‘ Christendom”, is the chief visible part of Satan’s organization on earth, it is certain, according to the Scriptures, that it will suffer the most. Armageddon will be terrible upon all nations, but particularly upon the realm of “Christendom” because within that realm is found the greatest opposition to the message of Jehovah’s truth. Jehovah says concerning that time: “For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. . . . And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.”—Jeremiah 25: 29-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If there is a way of escape from the disaster coming upon humankind, no one could avail himself of that way unless he is first informed as to the means of escape. To keep the people in ignorance of God's Word of truth would mean to prevent them from knowing the way of escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everybody knows that the peoples of the world are now in great distress and perplexity, and there is no earthly power that can pull the nations out of that dilemma. Why then denounce anyone who is merely telling the people why these things have come to pass and what is God's remedy for suffering humanity? The only answer is, Because Satan exercises his subtle influence to keep the people in ignorance in order that he may turn them away from Jehovah and cause their destraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every one will identify himself. As Jehu caused all the Baal worshipers to identify themselves before he slew them, so likewise Christ Jesus, the Greater Jehu, will cause all the Devil’s representatives to identify themselves before He slays them. AU who oppose God and His kingdom message thus identify themselves as being on the Devil’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Members of the Radio Commission of Canada are supposed to be the servants of the people, but they now presumptuously put themselves in a position of dictators by determining what the people shall or shall not hear by radio. If they have the power to censor one speech, they can censor all and keep the people in darkness. Have the people of Canada reached such a state of low intellectuality that they need to have a “wise” radio commission to approve what they shall hear about the Bible? This censorship order bears the earmarks of the clergy, who have assumed to be the spiritual guardians of mankind. Themselves being unable to explain the Bible truths now in the hands of the people, they want to prevent them from hearing more.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Fight Gets Under Way</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The future of the human polecats does not look bright. It is too bad to have to use a good pair of tongs on them, but the tongs can be fumigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most people are so used to being robbed and lied to that they take it all meekly as a matter of course. Some are even grateful to the thieves and liars and prostrate themselves before them, but occasionally there is one that straightway sees the point when a wrong has been done, and once in a great while there is a newspaper that has the courage to speak up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a recent issue of the Vancouver </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font5"> there appeared the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIO BAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Editor, Sun: Sir,—</span><span class="font4"> After reading the news item on front page of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font4"> last Thursday regarding the banning of Judge Rutherford’s usual weekly 15-min-ute Bible lecture from all Canadian broadcasting stations, I became curious to know just why a few dignified divines (D.D.’s) had complained about this “foreign agitator’’ as they were pleased to call him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So I tuned in on station KJR Seattle at 10: 30 a.m. Sunday and heard this world-famed Bible scholar preach the truth from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I understand now why the clergy object to the preaching of the truth. They never did like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus was on earth He didn’t have anything complimentary to say to them or about them. He called them “wolves in sheep’s clothing,’’ “whited sepulchres,” “scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites,”etc., etc., and they tried to stop Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They finally crucified Him. The clergy of today are the exact counterpart of this class, and if Jesus Christ was on earth again in the flesh they would crucify Him again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people are tired of listening to unscriptural doctrines like the “trinity,” a brimstone “hell,” “immortality of the soul,” etc., etc., consequently the churches arc mostly empty and the clergy are naturally peeved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford preaches Bible truths and nothing else, so I will continue to listen in to his message over KJR every Sunday morning at 10: 30. I will also obtain some of his books and I know I will enjoy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2043 East 7th Ave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Forsythe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Forsythe sees the issue a great deal more clearly than the editor of the Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire.</span><span class="font5"> The latter is a paper of great influence in Canada, but without hesitation it threw the entire weight of its voice against justice and reason and liberty, and in favor of tyranny, prejudice and bondage. Their editorial we put into the record, to their’ shame. When will the common people ever learn that among their most potent enemies are the newspapers, the mouthpieces of Big Business? The following is the editorial which appeared in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire </span><span class="font5">of January 20. We reproduce it under our own headline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canada Gives Up Her Liberties</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Canadian Radio Commission has prohibited further broadcasting of Judge Rutherford’s speeches by Canadian stations until these are approved by the censor. These speeches have been a feature of the so-called Watch Tower International Broadcast, a service that has been identified with the International Bible Students’ Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This action of the Charlesworth Commission recalls a similar one taken by the Mackenzie King Government in 1929. At that time Hon. Mr. Cardin, Minister of Marine, refused a renewal of licenses to four radio stations belonging to this Bible Students’ Association, an organization which used to be on the air early and late, week days and Sundays, mingling Bible quotations with the bitterest attacks upon the churches, the clergy of all denominations and the British Empire. It constantly supplied the unthinking with the most disturbing, revolutionary teachings. In an effort to arouse popular sentiment against the Liberal Government of that day, the association distributed a leaflet entitled “The Messenger.” Assuming the role of Moses on Mount Sinai the organization thundered in the name of “Jehovah God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No longer can Canada boast of being a land of religious freedom. The fact that the Government now controls the air and uses its influence to the end that only such clergymen shall broadcast their sermons as will, hypocritically in the name of the Lord, serve up a mixture of meaningless nonsense which has the approval of the powers that be and which ignores the Word of God, is but another proof that freedom of thought is done. It is also evidence that the end is near. No nation can continue to ignore God and continue to exist. The selfish predatory powers have the people by the throat and oppress them without mercy. Unfaithful to God, the clergy ally themselves with that unrighteous influence, aiding in the oppression of the people and in keeping them in ignorance of God’s provision for their welfare. God has promised to hear the cries of the people in due time. Their cries have reached unto His ears. The end of oppression is near at hand. It will be the most terrible day of reckoning that the world has ever known. God declares He will justly and fully recompense the oppressors by completely breaking them to pieces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some members of the Conservative Opposition made the mistake of championing the Bible Students, but Mr. Cardin and the Mackenzie King Government were urged to take courage and stand their ground against a species of propaganda originating in the United States, which often expressed views hostile to established institutions both in the United States and in this country. The issue has once more arisen in a somewhat different form. Prohibited from owningstations in this country, the organization has been using a number of Canadian stations. We think that the general feeling throughout Canada will support the decree just issued by the Canadian Radio Commission, which henceforth subjects all Watch Tower broadcasts to a strict censorship. The Commission may not be able to exclude these broadcasts altogether if the organization is able to employ powerful United States stations to reach Canadian listeners. But at least the Canadian Commission will not be placing the mark of its approval upon propaganda which it regards as injurious to the general public.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Charlesworth Jumpy and Nervous</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For a censor, 1933 model, Charlesworth is jumpy and nervous. Polecats are like that, or seem to be. Thus, when the Calgary (Alberta) station CFCN wired him: “With reference to your wire re Judge Rutherford transcriptions: local organization now desire to put on local speaker for these periods. Please advise us your wishes re such arrangements,” he wired back “The International Bible Students are at liberty to put on local speaker so long as he refrains from offensive comments on doctrines and clergy of other denominations and from abuse of public men and institutions in Canada. Watch this continuity carefully and cut off if these conditions are broken.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now what is there about Canadian doctrines, and Canadian clergy, Canadian public men and Canadian institutions that is so sacrosanct that they must not be mentioned ? Are the men that are lined squarely up on the side of the Devil so thin-skinned that they deny their parentage? If Charlesworth had been present when Jesus told the scribes and Pharisees “Ye are of your father the devil”, he would have said something to Him like what he said about Judge Rutherford in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night.</span><span class="font5"> A polecat hates to have anything said reflecting on him or his fellow polecats.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Two Liberty-Loving Editors</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The periodical </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hush</span><span class="font5"> goes after Charlesworth in its issue of February 4 with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> good deal more courage and manliness than was shown by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire.</span><span class="font5"> The editor does not relish giving up all his rights to a polecat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Let There be Light’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What Winnipeg Influence Caused Hector Charlesworth to Ban Judge Rutherford’s Orations on</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Radio? — Were They Afraid of More Light on the Stubbs Charges ? — Why Do the Clergy Tremble ? — Truth Must Prevail</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That old Saturday Night-Big Interest sweetheart, Hector Charlesworth, now playing the role of Chairman of the Federal Radio Commission, issued instructions last week to all radio stations to discontinue the Judge Rutherford Bible student broadcasts pending their censorship by the Commission as being not abusive of other religious or governmental institutions. Who is dictating to Hector Charlesworth now? Is somebody or some government faction afraid of the TRUTH being broadcast? Mr. Charlesworth denies that the ban is the result of interference by the clergy of Canada. If this is true, then who is responsible for this extraordinary action? It is safe to say that 75 per cent of radio listeners desire to hear what Judge Rutherford has to say about modern institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States Government has never considered such steps necessary. It is common knowledge that the super-sensitive Canadian clergy are afraid of Judge Rutherford’s pundits of TRUTH. It is significant that the first move to break this ban was taken in Winnipeg, where the citizens are, more than ever, crying for the Light amidst a fog of charges and counter charges of graft, theft, corruption, judicial irregularities, suppression of free speech and what not. If the public of Canada were not universally trained by the Big Interest suborned press to believe in any hypocrite who carried a Bible in his hands, with a lie on his lips at the same time to hide his criminal acts, blind faith would not have been placed for so long in “Honest John” Machray who fun-dumblcd, foneyfugled and hoodwinked the silly people of Winnipeg for so many years, during which he contrived to convert criminally over $1,000,000 of sacred trust funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps some kind soul in Winnipeg thought Judge Rutherford might comment on the Stubbs affair, because it is known that Rutherford, like Stubbs, is an exponent of the TRUTH? Hector Charlesworth has ever lived in a world of literary dreams, save when listening with intent submission to the “Master’s Voice”. He has now received the Master’s reward— he is a little silver cog in the System’s wheel. God bless and keep Hector Charlesworth in his servility!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two weeks after the foregoing appeared in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hush,</span><span class="font5"> the periodical </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span><span class="font5"> (Halifax, Nova Scotia) published the following, which is of real value to the cause of truth in the earth at this critical time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TORY WAR-MONGERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following will give you an idea why the Tory war-mongers ruled Judge Rutherford off the air:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over a recent national chain of radio stations, Judge Rutherford startled millions of listeners with his emphatic pronouncement that within a short time the people will witness the complete destruction of the American government. Never before in the history of this nation had the people heard such statements of stinging rebuke and indictment against the rulers of this land, Big Business and its allies and abettors in crime, the politicians and professional clergymen. He quoted ample Bible proofs and cited physical facts and documentary evidence for every charge against the cruel and oppressive rulers of the American people. Judge Rutherford does not take sides in politics, nor does he indulge in personalities. His only motive is to point out to the people from the Scriptures that their only hope for relief from the terrible suffering, distress and unrighteousness now prevailing on the earth is God’s Kingdom which, the prophecies disclose, will soon displace all present governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We quote a few statements Judge Rutherford made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today there is no true patriotism among the rulers of the nation. It is now impossible for the people to elect men to public office and to expect them to enact just laws and to administer the affairs of the government for the general welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Big Business has no regard for the rights of the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It controls the two major political parties of America, and names and elects at will the public men to office who will best serve their selfish interests. Big Business controls the army and the navy, the guns and the ammunition and the police power of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan has used commerce, politics and religion that he might get complete control of the human race and defame the name and Word of Jehovah God. For this reason, it is written in the Bible (1 John 5: 19), ‘The whole world is now under the wicked one.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The rulers have been duly informed and duly warned that Jehovah God’s kingdom is here. They have refused to give heed. They disregard the Word of God and go on with their imperfect schemes, and will continue to try one after another, all of which shall fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest crisis of the ages is now upon the world, and this includes the American government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Jesus were to walk into Washington today and mingle with the suffering veterans in their camp He would be denounced by the clergymen as a man of low civilization. It is this same class of clergymen and political lobbyists that recently adopted a resolution, which appears in the Washington Herald under date of June 10, 1932, declaring that Christ Jesus belongs to a lower civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy, while claiming to represent God, in fact represent the Devil and his organization. In order that the people might hear the truth and determine this matter for themselves recently I challenged the combined clergy of America to select their best man to debate this question by radio. Charged with misrepresenting God and serving Satan these gentlemen should either come forward and prove the falsity of the charge or, failing in that, should cease to hold themselves out as teachers of the Word of God. Jehovah foretold the outcome of such a challenge and the attitude that would be assumed by the preachers, when He caused His prophet Jeremiah to write, at chapter fifty-one, verse thirty: “The mighty men of Babylon [Satan’s organization] have forborn to fight; they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed.” Let the people take note of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1917 Big Business, for ultraselfish reasons, needlessly and wantonly forced the American nation into the World War which resulted in the greatly increased wealth and power of a few men and made serfs and paupers of many millions of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With grasping arms like the tentacles of a mighty octopus, Big Business has laid hold upon practically all of the visible wealth of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The American government has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. It cannot endure. Together with all other nations, it soon shall fall. Such fall will be in spite of everything Big Business, politicians and clergymen, the military and the “strong-arm squad,” and the Devil and all of his hosts can do to hold together the oppressive rule. It must and will fall because Jehovah God’s kingdom is here. Hasten now to take shelter under Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same selfish interests own and control the professional clergymen, and these men make merchandise of the Word of God in order to keep the people in ignorance and in subjection to the ruling powers. Thus it is plainly seen that the power of the government is centralized in the hands of a very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within a short time Jehovah God will destroy the Devil and his entire organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah made this earth for man to live upon in peace and plenty, health and happiness; and under the reign of Christ, He declares, the earth shall yield her increase, and God shall bless the people, and all in the earth shall know Him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Canadian Troops in Action</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil always gets off to a flying start. Charlesworth and his fellow polecats were in high feather on January 16, when they let loose. It takes the Lord’s people time to get under way with the fumigating and cleansing process now commanding attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On February 18 the “Important Notice”, which was our leading article in Number 351, began to be placed in every home in Canada. Straightway the Devil’s crowd began to evidence pain. Protests appeared in several papers, but it is like protesting against a snowstorm after the storm has begun. A particularly amusing squawk is the following, which appeared in the Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> for February 23:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A REMONSTRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the Editor of the Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sir: Toronto, if not Canada at large, has been flooded during the last few days with a four-page important notice from Judge Rutherford, the head of tho Russellite or International Bible Student Movement, protesting against the action of Mr. Charlesworth, the chairman of the Canadian Radio Commission, in suppressing or censoring the broadcasting of his speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canadians generally will doubtlessly be intelligent enough to valuate for themselves the main content of the appeal, which is, like much of their teaching, a curious compound of truth and error. He quotes a great deal of Scripture, but Scripture can be strangely perverted, and texts can be torn bleeding from their context.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But there is a postscript, to which special attention is called as a challenge to the clergy. He takes the names of three honored clergymen of the Anglican church, Canon McKim, the Rev. Mr. Steward and the Rev. Mr. Martin, rectors of churches in St. John, N. B., men of the highest reputation for probity, piety and practical Christianity. And says: “These reverend gentlemen pose before the people as the representatives of God and Christ and His kingdom. I charge that they in fact represent Satan the Devil.” And then he adds a wider challenge that “the clergymen of the Anglican church, contrary to their claim, do not in fact represent Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and His kingdom, but that they do represent and serve Satan the Devil and that thereby the people are deceived.” I simply want to point out, as a remonstrance against such assertions, that these men, two of whom I know intimately, are truly consecrated men of God and that Judge Rutherford’s widely disseminated diatribe against the Anglican church as a whole w<sup>r</sup>ould in itself warrant the Radio Commission of Canada in refusing the Russellites the use of existing facilities for broadcasting without first submitting the same to the broadcasting commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Toronto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rev.) Dyson Hague</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reverend Hague, in his grief over the charge that McKim, Steward and Martin represent Satan the Devil, and that the clergymen of the Anglican church, all of them, are in the same boat, seems to have overlooked the fact that the remedy is in their own hands. All they have to do is get together and arrange the radio debate that Judge Rutherford has invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Moncton (N. B.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span><span class="font5"> of February 27 contained the following, which is true in the words which we have reproduced in italics. The rest of it is false. That is something of a record, 6 true words out of 59. We assume, because of its untruthfulness, that it was written by some clergyman, some man of corrupt </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mind, </span><span class="font5">some polecat. The headline is ours:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL OVER CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The blasphemous Rutherford leaflets recently distributed from door to door in Moncton were </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">circulated generally all over Canada.</span><span class="font4"> In Toronto some school children were engaged in the work, probably not knowing the character of the leaflet but,out to make a few dimes. Again it is pertinent to enquire whence the source of the money available for this work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Afraid to Face the Issue</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Not only are the clergy afraid to face the issue, but the newspapers betray the same anxiety not to let this matter come before the people in its true light. If Judge Rutherford’s charges are true, as we firmly believe them to be, then it is of the utmost importance that the people know the truth, so that they can range themselves on the side of the God whom they elect to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The newspapers should aid them in this, but the Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font5"> though publishing Reverend Hague’s remonstrance, tries to pass over the matter lightly in its accompanying editorial herewith reproduced. This editorial is of no value, because it helps the people not at all. Most people who read it, instead of seeing the great issues at stake, will be misled by the attempted facetiousness of the editor into thinking that it makes no difference whether Judge Rutherford is right or wrong. In point of fact, it actually makes all the difference between life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MR. CHARLESWORTH IN THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Hector Charlesworth was made chairman of the Radio Commission we said that, on looking back, it seemed to us that all his life he had been in training for this post. Today we are not so sure of it. Mr. Charlesworth is up against something now for which we cannot see that he has had any training. Judge Rutherford is after him with Biblical prophecies of great omen. A four-page folder is being distributed from house to house in Toronto conveying an Important Notice, beginning in this way:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About the 18th of January, 1933, the following telegram was sent by the Canadian Radio Commission to radio stations throughout that country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Speeches of one Judge Rutherford, foreign anti-social agitator, must not be broadcast by Canadian stations until the continuity or records of same are submitted to the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission for approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Signed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Hector Charlesworth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Chairman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford, who deals with prophecies over the air, had not predicted this order. So out comes his four-page folder. Mr. Charlesworth has probably read more literature about the Battle of Waterloo than about the Battle of Armageddon. He has probably studied Shakespeare and other dramatists, ancient and modern, English and foreign, more than he has the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures. We may bo doing him an injustice in saying this, but, at least, we are justified in saying that Mr. Charlesworth has written in the press more about Eugene O’Neill than about the Prophet Ezekiel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Rutherford tells us in his four-page folder that the “great Battle of Armageddon is approaching, at which time the final conflict between the forces of Satan and those of Jehovah will take place.” Rumor had it that Satan had lost out long ago, but we have at times had reason to suspect that certain persons we do not care to name were working for him either directly or indirectly. We had no idea, however, after glimpsing Milton and Dante that Lucifer was still in a position to fight to a show-down. Judge Rutherford has not a doubt. The great fight comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British Empire is the seventh Empire. Seven is a mystic number; why should there be more than seven Empires? Of course by leaving out an Empire here and there the British Empire could be called the sixth or by adding an Empire or two it could be shown to be the ninth or the eleventh, but in order that it may conform to expectant prophecy let us call it the seventh and await the millennium. Here is where Mr. Charlesworth ought to consult his lawyer. Judge Rutherford writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Scriptures show that the chief officer of Satan in leading his wicked forces is called Gog and who formulates and leads in a conspiracy against Jehovah’s witnesses and against His kingdom, and that such conspiracy will begin and be prosecuted within the realms of the seventh world power above mentioned. Satan’s effort is to keep the people in ignorance of what is about to come to pass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While we wish to occupy an entirely impartial position in this discussion we feel compelled to say that Judge Rutherford pretty clearly indicates that he identifies Mr. Charlesworth as Gog, the chief Canadian agent of Satan. This, we feel sure, was not an office which Mr. Charlesworth knowingly accepted at the request of Prime Minister Bennett, who merely asked him to take charge of radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In concluding his four-page folder Judge Rutherford challenges the clergy to meet him in debate—the clergy who represent Satan while he, alone on earth evidently, represents God—but we would suggest that the argument is shifted and that Judge Rutherford should challenge Mr. Hector Charlesworth to meet him in debate in Massey Hall on some date agreeable to both parties. What a night!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Saturday Night” on a Higher Plane</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have before indicated our appreciation of the fact that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font5"> was improved by Hector Charlesworth’s connection with it being severed. We do not see how it could have been otherwise. His withdrawal from anything would automatically cleanse and purify it. From the issue of February 25 we quote the following not half bad front page item. It shines by contrast with the supine editorial in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail and Empire</span><span class="font5"> and the colorless one in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN AND THE RADIO SYSTEM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WE LEARN from a circular signed by the eminent Judge Rutherford, who further subscribes himself “one of the servants of Jehovah”, that it is his contention that the clergymen of the Anglican Church “do represent and serve Satan the Devil and that thereby the people are deceived”. He desires to debate this contention over a national radio chain with one of the three Anglican clergymen of Saint John whose protest recently led to his being excluded from the Canadian radio stations. The contention, which, it should be borne in mind, would have had the support of quite a large number of Christian Canadians in the more violent theological days of the Family Compact, strikes us as an interesting one about which we should like to hear more, although the probability of our being converted to a thorough-going belief in it is extremely small. Since, however, the judge is not likely to be permitted to rejoin the gracious company of educators who are now engaged in improving the minds of the Canadian people with the aid of the wave systems discovered by Marconi, we presume we shall have to rely upon his printed literature, which is not yet being suppressed when printed in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is one thing about it, and that is that his exclusion from the radio system can have caused no surprise to so earnest a Bible student as Judge Rutherford, who may be well aware that one of Satan’s most important titles is that of ‘ ‘ prince of the powers of the air”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Zeal of the Neophyte</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The day before Jehovah’s witnesses went into action to put the “Important Notice” regarding the radio censorship into the hands of the Canadian people, Charlesworth wired station CKOK, Detroit-Windsor, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Our rules in connection with the Watch Tower Society are that they may go on the air provided they refrain from abuse of the doctrines and clergy of other churches and from attacks on public institutions of this country. It is necessary to watch this continuity carefully, as transgressions have occurred at several stations where the Watch Tower people have been allowed to go on the air. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the “Notice” campaign got under way, and the people began to get and read the folders, by the millions, he suddenly came to realize that he had grabbed a bull by the tail. In sudden fright he wired all stations in Canada as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No broadcasts containing Judge Rutherford’s speeches, letters or publications are to be carried out by any Canadian broadcasting station until continuity and records have been submitted to and approved by Canadian Radio Commission.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is going some. One man will do all the thinking for the people of Canada. They shall have nothing to say about it. If he thinks it is good for them to hear, they may hear it. If he thinks it best, for any reason whatever, that they should not hear it, then, in his mind, if Jesus Christ himself, or even Jehovah the Almighty God, wishes to present a message to the people of Canada, it cannot go on the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We recognize that spirit. It is the spirit of the one who said, “I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.”—Isaiah 14:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the spirit of the same one who said: “My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself” (Ezekiel 29:3), and of the one who said to Jesus: “All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be thine.” —Luke 4:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Charlesworth Censorship Illegal</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would hardly seem necessary to call the attention of the liberty-loving people of Canada to the fact that the Charlesworth censorship is illegal, lawless, a usurpation of authority, yet we patiently do even that, knowing that the time of reckoning draws on apace in which all injustices will receive their due recompense of reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford authorizes us to say that he has recently taken the opinion of a well-known firm of lawyers in Canada and the following is a quotation from their opinion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Charlesworth, gives as his authority for the control of broadcasting Sections 8,9 and 10 of the Act. As yet no by-laws or regulations have been promulgated. It is our view that the telegram from the chairman to the broadcasting stations forbidding the broadcast of Judge Rutherford’s speeches in the manner that the telegram was worded, was entirely unauthorized and we do not think either the chairman or the Commission had any authority so to act until by-laws or resolutions or regulations respecting such censorship had first been passed and approved by counsel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We expect to have more to say, in a later issue, on this subject of robbing the people of their rights, under the specious plea of public interest, but at this point conclude to terminate this article with a quotation from the Scriptures which fits the conditions very well:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. Then they that feared [Jehovah] spake often one to another; and [Jehovah] hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared [Jehovah], and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, saith [Jehovah] of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith [Jehovah] of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.—Malachi 3:15-17; 4: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The complete overwhelming, annihilation of the enemies of God, referred to by the prophet Amos as a “flood<sup>-</sup>’, is here mentioned under the symbolism of a “fire”. The event is the same, and the conclusion is the same: the complete destruction of those that oppose Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford, with the most important message that ever came to the sons of men, temporarily deprived of his rights in Canada, is yet in a happy place, “the secret place of the Most High,” while Hector Charlesworth, accepting the Devil’s offer, and doing his illegal bidding, is in for justly merited shame in the present, and has yet to answer at the bar of Jehovah God for the injustice and illegality he has practiced upon one of His meek and obedient servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ahaziah Fell Through the Lattice</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font5">N A CERTAIN occasion Ahaziah, king of Israel, fell through the lattice and got considerably smashed up. Thereupon he sent to Baal-zebub (the Devil) to inquire if he would get well. Elijah’s opinion was not asked or desired, but he chanced to meet the courier and told him he need proceed no further, but could go back and tell the one who sent him that he was not going to get well, but would die; and he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And that reminds us of what has happened to financialdom. It is sick with its last sickness. It has fallen through the lattice. The Standard Statistics Company reports that in the first nine months of 1932 the net income of 390 important corporations showed a decline of 79.8 percent from the corresponding period of 1931, itself an extremely bad year. The profits of industrial companies dropped 99.4 percent. Sixty railroads showed a net deficit of $133,135,000 against an aggregate profit last year of $67,070,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Viewing the matter entirely from the standpoint of the Scriptures, Judge Rutherford has expressed the opinion that, bad as the world’s financial matters now are, they will get still worse, and there will be no recovery. The antitypical Ahaziah is uneasy and fears the worst, and rightly so. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font5"> Two shows that the funeral cannot be far off. “Zion heard, and was glad.”</span></p>

The spider was first noticed Saturday afternoon, in a small flower bed on the Crites lawn, where it has constructed its neatly built web. Sunday morning it attracted the attention of Mr. Crites, having written the word “service” on the web. Monday morning the letters “H. W. M.” were visible, and this morning the word “river”.

With the powerful station will come a 20,000-watt television station working in conjunction, so that as the truth is spread the public can see the speaker as well as valuable data that may be referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This station, reviewed recently in our columns, is XENT, now under construction in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, by Norman Baker of Muscatine, Iowa, and former owner of KTNT, which was one of America’s most popular stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Federal Radio Commission “clicked” on Mr. Baker and closed his station at Muscatine, in June, 1931, kicking him off the air without a moment’s notice and after he was deprived of the extension of time for his case in the court of appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bound to have the public informed of things that interest it, Mr. Baker went to Mexico, secured the permit, and started to build the station XENT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A beautiful site of 75 acres was purchased on the main paved highway from Nuevo Laredo to Monterey and nine miles from the America-Mexico border, directly on the main gateway to Mexico and Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A uniquely designed two-story building 72 x 72 has been erected of brick and stuccoed with beautiful original decorations. The main building is composed of four large rooms. The power room that houses the large transformers weighing over 20 tons, rectifiers, filament and high-voltage generators and apparatus, is 35 x 50. In this room are passageways so that the public can walk through and view all, with high screened fences or guards along the passageways to protect the public from the dangers of high voltage. The transmitter room is 35 by 50 feet, and houses the gigantic transmitter, which is assembled in a half circle, so that the engineers can sit at the desk and view every meter on the 80 feet of switchboards without walking to and fro along the full length of the transmitter panels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The large transmitter tubes used, of foreign importation, require a 5-horsepower motor pump for circulating the water to cool the tubes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many large tubes are used, one single tube costing nearly $2,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">More About Sprayed Apples </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W. Clark McGinnis (Washington)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">R</span><span class="font5">EFERRING to your recent article on sprayed apples’ being poisonous, would like to say this: That whoever wrote it had some misinformation. I have been connected with the apple business, both as grower and dealer, for a number of years; and the statements of this writer, giving the impression that sprayed apples are necessarily poisonous, are ridiculous and very misleading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a certain amount of these various chemicals, including arsenic, in many fruits and vegetables that are never sprayed; this is also true of aluminum. These are some of the elements of many soils and occur naturally in nature, and in their normal amounts are harmful to no one, as has been proved by the experience of thousands. In fact, arsenic in slight amounts has a tonic effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apples that leave this district are practically all thoroughly washed and wiped to remove the arsenic which might be left clinging to the surface. But a general practice here is for people to pick up the fruit and eat it just as it is with no ill effects that I personally know of. Also, I understand that doctors, in certain cases, occasionally prescribe certain amounts of arsenic. That doesn’t necessarily prove that it is the thing to do, but might be taken as an indication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also, the people here, in spraying time, handle this spray material, their bodies are often saturated with the liquid spray, more or less of it getting on their lips and mouth, and I have no personal knowledge of any poisoning resulting from this, and I personally have never had any ill effects from eating these apples or being around spray materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In any event, the impression that this writer gives, that when you eat a sprayed apple you are likely to be poisoned, must be erroneous in view of the fact that this valley ships from fifteen thousand to twenty thousand cars annually and if what he says is true there ought to be windrows of dead and dying citizens lying around each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And furthermore, if what he says is true, the population of this valley should be steadily decreasing from the number of people dead and dying from eating sprayed fruit as they do around here. Instead of that, there has been a steady increase in our population and, while I am not entirely sure of my information, I think the Wenatchee district is considered one of the very healthful districts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, I do not mean to infer that we should eat excess amounts of any of these elements, for, as the Scriptures say, we should be temperate in all things. I do not think there would be any danger from eating any properly washed or wiped apple, and very little even if it was not washed, unless there happened to be extra heavy coating of the residue from the spray tank when it was being emptied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">P.S. The advice to use muskmelons as fruit for sake of safety makes a grower smile, as these are customarily sprayed more often than any other fruit grown in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is typical of the lack of knowledge displayed by the writer of said article when he states that “many fruits are sprayed several times during the season”. The fact is that all fruits are sprayed from six to fifteen times, and, despite that, tests made on most orchards show that fruit contains less than the smallest medicinal dose of arsenic. To get enough arsenic to injure one it would be necessary to eat so many apples that one would be made sick by the quantity of fruit he had eaten and not by the poison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Promise to His Friend</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S promises are sure of fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the most important, if not the foremost in the Bible, is that promise which God made to Abraham. This promise is important because its fulfilment involves the vindication of the name and word of the Most High, as well as the blessing of all the obedient peoples of earth. For centuries God-fearing men and women have longed for better conditions in the earth and have prayed for the establishment of God’s kingdom. However, the prophecies of that kingdom and the hope for the peoples as pointed out in the Abrahamic promise were not understood until recent years. From examination of the Scriptures it is now clearly evident that prophecy cannot be understood until God’s own due time, and that the due time is marked when such prophecies are in course of fulfilment. Since Jehovah placed His King Christ Jesus upon the throne in 1914 and the generation now upon earth has witnessed the fulfilment of related scriptures, we have reason to believe that the Abrahamic promise is due to be fulfilled in the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To those who are devoted to the Lord, His word of truth is final. Such therefore rely upon the promises of Jehovah as the heralds of the good things to come. Furthermore, since the Abrahamic promise awaits the development of a seed of inheritance, we shall be interested in noting those scriptures which relate to the royal house through which all families of earth will be blessed. Then, too, we shall examine those statements of the Bible relating to the gathering by Jehovah of all things in Christ for the work of the ministry and the ultimate blessing of all peoples. Finally we shall be better enabled to understand the responsibility now resting upon members of the royal house and the prospective blessing awaiting the world of mankind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark214"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>Jehovah’s Great Promise</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is appropriate to examine the promise made to Abraham and the life of this faithful man as it relates to the purposes of Jehovah. When Abraham (then called Abram) was seventy-five years of age, Jehovah said to him: ‘■'Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: . . . and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12:1-3) Abram with his wife and others left Ur for the land of Canaan. ’When they had reached a point in that land known as Sichem, the Lord appeared unto him and said: ‘Unto thy seed will I give this land.’ Abram budded an altar there, near the place later known as ‘•Bethel”, which means ‘‘the house of God”. Afterward he dwelt in the plains of Mamre, just above the present site of Hebron, in the southern part of Palestine. While there, God made a covenant with him, saying: “Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.”—Genesis 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thereafter, when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared unto him and said: “I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly . . . and thou shalt be a father of many nations. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.” (Genesis 17: 2,4, 8) Some time later, when Abraham was sitting at the door of his tent, pitched in the plains of Mamre, there stood before him three men, messengers from Jehovah. There, a short distance above the town of Hebron, still stands a very ancient oak tree. It is about thirty feet in circumference. It is claimed that this is Abraham’s oak, where he pitched his tent at the time these holy messengers appeared to him. Of course we cannot believe this to be true, because an oak would not live that length of time. It is interesting, however, to note this ancient tree standing approximately at the point where Abraham is supposed to have resided in his tent. Here it was that Abraham prepared refreshments for his distinguished visitors; “and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.” Here it was that the messenger of Jehovah told Abraham that he and his wife Sarah would be given a son.—Genesis 18:1-14.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark216"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>Abraham’s Faith Tested</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In due time a son was born unto Abraham and Sarah, and his name was called Isaac. (Genesis 21:1-3) Afterward, when the son Isaac had grown up, Jehovah put Abraham to a great test, and in doing so lie made a picture which foreshadowed the redemption of the human race. This record appears in the twenty-second chapter of Genesis. God said unto Abraham: ‘‘Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.” (Genesis 22:2) It is interesting here to note that Mount Moriah is inside of the walls of the present city of Jerusalem. It was the site of the temple of Solomon, and is supposed to be the very spot where Abraham was met by Melchizedek. It is the place where Abraham was directed to offer and did offer up his son Isaac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Providing himself with wood to be used for the fire, Abraham and his son and servants journeyed for three days from the plains of Mamre to Moriah; and arriving there, he at once prepared for the burnt offering. Isaac was not aware of the purpose of his father to offer him; so he said to his father: “Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.” Abraham then informed his son that he was to be the offering. Then he bound Isaac and laid him upon the altar and stretched forth his hand and took the knife with which to slay his son. This was a great test to Abraham’s faith. Isaac was his only son and he loved him dearly; but Jehovah had commanded him to offer him up as a sacrifice, and because of his love for Jehovah he proceeded to obey God’s command. As he raised his hand to strike dead his only beloved son “the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, . . . lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.” When Abraham looked he saw a ram caught in a thicket near by, and he took the ram and offered it for a burnt offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then “the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham . . . the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord; for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”—Genesis 22:15-18.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark218"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>Sacrifice Basis for Covenant</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this wonderful picture Abraham was a type of Jehovah, while Isaac was a type of Jesus, the beloved Son of Jehovah. Abraham’s offering his beloved son on the altar pictured how God in due time would offer His only beloved Son as a great sacrifice that mankind might be redeemed from death and have an opportunity to live. Abraham did not, as indeed he could not, understand God’s purposes, for the reason that Jehovah did not reveal them to him; but he knew that God had here made a covenant with him and bound it with His oath; and that by these two certain and unchangeable things, His word and His oath, God would carry out His covenant in due time, and that covenant would result in the blessing of all the families of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">covenant</span><span class="font5"> means “contract”; and it is the solemn form for expressing a compact, agreement, or contract between parties, or particularly on the part of one whereby he promises to do a certain thing. With Jehovah a covenant or a contract is sacred and inviolate, because Jehovah changes not. (Malachi 3:6) Having-promised it, he will fulfil it. (Hebrews 6:18) It is always necessary that there be two parties to a contract. There may be more. Where one party only is bound to do a certain thing, that contract is called “unilateral”, or one-sided; and where both parties are bound to perform certain things, the contract is called “bilateral”, or two-sided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be observed that this oathbound covenant that Jehovah made with Abraham contained no conditions or limitations, but was merely a promise of Jehovah bound by His oath, and is therefore properly called a unilateral or one-sided covenant, for the reason that God’s purpose was and is to carry out His desire to bless the human race, regardless of what anyone may or may not do. There was no need for Him to make any conditions to the covenant. He merely announced His benevolent purpose toward mankind. The covenant does not even say that the blessing of the people will follow upon the condition that Abraham should do a certain thing, or that the people should seek Him. The covenant does not say that every person will be blessed with life everlasting; but it does say that all the families of the earth shall be blessed, which means that every one must in God’s due time have a full, fair opportunity for life everlasting. It means, further, that in God’s due time knowledge will be brought to all in order that every one may avail himself of the opportunity thus provided for life. It means, furthermore, that assistance will be given to every one, that he may profit by this blessed opportunity; and all who prove their loyalty under the test that will come by reason of the opportunity will be granted life everlasting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>Expectation of Deliverer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Having examined some of the scriptures and the history surrounding the promise that was given to Abraham, we are now in position to note the development of this seed through which all people will be blessed. Abraham believed that God would bless the human race, but he did not understand the manner or the time in which that would be done. The blessing did not come through Isaac, nor through Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, but God did renew the promise to both of these faithful men. When the nation of Israel was delivered from Egyptian bondage it was thought that this chosen people of God would be the immediate people through whom all mankind would receive the blessing; but such was not the purpose of Jehovah. He, however, did use that people to make pictures concerning better things to come. Time and again as a national leader arose in Israel the hopes of that people w<sup>T</sup>ere in expectation of the deliverer; repeatedly they were disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus came into the world John the Baptist announced that He was the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world. Jesus preached the good news of a kingdom in which His Father’s name would be vindicated and the people would be blessed. He promised that His faithful followers would share with Him in this kingdom, and He taught them to pray for that kingdom. The faithful Jews of Jesus’ day expected the kingdom to be restored to Israel at that time, but He warned them that the Father had put such in His own power. Although Jesus was not at that time made King in the new kingdom, the purpose of His presence here on earth was that He might bear witness to the truth and also provide the ransom for the human family.—John 18: 37; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>Seed of Promise</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Christ is spoken of in the Bible as the seed of Abraham, and the members of His body are also included in the seed. This mystery concerning the Abrahamic promise and the promised seed was not understood until the last half century, and only within recent months have any appreciated clearly the purpose of the gathering of all things in Christ by the great Jehovah. The mere fact that we are learning more now concerning the purpose of the seed of Abraham is proof that the real work to be performed by this company is at hand, and there is effectiveness in the accomplishment of the service as the various parts in the body work in harmony. In Galatians 3:16 it is written, “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” And then, by way of assuring the followers of Christ of their participation in the great promise, Paul, speaking for Jehovah, says, “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”—Galatians 3: 26, 27, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Christ, then, is the seed of Abraham through which all the families of the earth are to be blessed. The Christ includes not only Christ Jesus the head, but also all the members of His body. It has been this class which the heavenly Father has been calling during the period from the days of Jesus to the present time. And it is by this class that the praises of the great Jehovah will be sung throughout eternity and which class the Creator will use in the blessing of all the obedient members of the human family.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark224"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>Gathering of The Christ</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is clear to the student of the Scriptures that since 1918 Jehovah has been gathering all things in Christ for the administration of a great work. This class that is gathered is the same group as the seed of Abraham. In Ephesians 1:10 we read, according to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font5"> “For an administration of the fulness of the seasons to reunite for himself (under one head) the all things in the Christ, the things upon the heavens, and the things upon the earth, in him.” The term “fulness of the seasons”, as used in this text, means the same as “the day of Jehovah” or “that day”, as these terms are used in the Old Testament. It is in “the day of Jehovah” that He comes forth to honor and vindicate His own name. It is only as the name of the Great Jehovah is vindicated that the people can understand who the Almighty really is. It is only as the people have faith in Him that they will receive of His pleasure and blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gathers all the creatures in Christ for His own work. The objective and purpose of the disciples for the past nineteen hundred years has been, not to learn a little about the truth and then fall asleep in death or to go to heaven, but for the vindication of Jehovah's name and eventually the blessing of the human family. In 1918 Jehovah through Christ Jesus gathered the followers of Christ who had previously died by bringing them forth from the tombs of death by resurrection as spirit creatures. He has also gathered the remnant here on earth into His well-regulated organization. These are in the midst of a great work for the honor of Jehovah’s name, and that work will grow until it involves all creatures who will ever have life everlasting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark226"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>Educating the People</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is apparent to all that the seed of Abraham has not as yet blessed all the families of earth. If we look at the actual conditions of the people on earth today we behold anything but blessing. We find a lack of faith; we find crime, corruption, misery, despair and death. The mere fact that such a picture actually exists is evidence that the blessing of all the families of earth is yet future. It is evident that something must be done before the blessing of the people. They must know who their Benefactor is. There will be something required of all who will obtain the bounties of the new kingdom. They must be educated. They must know that Jehovah is God. His name must be vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is just such a work in which the seed of Abraham is engaged at the present time. The visible members of the Abrahamie inheritance now have the privilege of bringing to the people the message of the great Jehovah; they are telling the people of His mighty works; they are pointing out to the people the one hope, the kingdom of God! “All thy works shall praise thee, 0 Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endur-eth throughout all generations.”—Psalm 145: 10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was on earth He was very insistent that His followers emphasize the important things in life. Those important things are God’s kingdom and the course of righteousness that is pleasing to Jehovah. Jehovah’s good name is bound up in the Kingdom, and the happiness of all earthly creatures awaits the rule of righteousness. The individuals have the responsibility to seek the Kingdom, tell others about the Kingdom, and to work for the Kingdom. They also have the responsibility to know the course of righteousness and to walk humbly therein.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>Kingdom Necessary</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that the blessing of the peoples of the earth lies in the establishment of the Kingdom is that God’s good name and His laws are the foundation of all good things. As justice is the foundation of Jehovah’s throne, so God’s laws are the basis of order, of harmonious action, and of everlasting peace. To go contrary to the laws of the Creator always leads to confusion and sorrow. Prosperity among the people lies not in the furious roar of machinery, spurred on by the selfish motive to accumulate wealth; but it does lie in the establishment and observance of Jehovah’s just law’s, when each man will guard the interests of his neighbor as his owm, w’hen a just balance will be set up in the market place, and when the plow’share will supplant the bloody bayonet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Above all, understanding of the good name of Jehovah is necessary to beget confidence, hope, life, everything. When people know Jehovah they will rely upon Him to settle all disputes, because they will know<sup>7</sup> that He will settle them right. To know Jehovah will bring strength to the feeble-minded, because the great Benefactor can give what each creature needs. To know the Most High leads to love and respect with a conviction that no creature can question God's supremacy. To know the Almighty brings support to the w<sup>T</sup>eak when he realizes that even the lowliest citizen in the Kingdom is sustained by the boundless power of its Creator. To know the true God will instill reverence for Him, and childlike obedience. “0 praise [Jehovah], all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. For his merciful kindness is great tow’ard us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye [Jehovah].”—Psalm 117.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Barter Exchanges</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HIS past winter barter exchanges have been in operation in at least twenty-two states of the Union, and perhaps in all of them, and the surprising thing is how well they work. It is a revelation to everybody concerned that they can live comfortably, in a land fairly bursting with food and fuel and other human requirements, without any money and without any banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the activities or services of the exchanges are restaurants, canneries, bakeries, drug stores, physicians, plumbers, carpenters, warehouses, shoe factories, tanneries, abattoirs, coal mines, sawmills, soap factories, clothing factories, barber shops, and trucks. In Salt Lake City one music finn was glad to exchange forty pianos and $1,000 worth of radios for the scrip which the barter exchanges use in lieu of money. Many theaters and stores accept scrip in lieu of cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A barter exchange can use anything that human creatures need, and the success of those established, and their rapid spread, indicates that a new system of distribution is being gradually ushered in before our very eyes. No railroad systems have been offered yet, but that may come at any time. And trucks today can do almost anything that the railroads can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Minneapolis the organization is divided into thirteen wards, with one captain for each precinct and a worker for each block, making, all together, 3,700 officers and leaders of the 18,000 families kept from distress by the barter system. Of the Minneapolis group, during the winter 1,000 men were working in twenty-one wood camps. The farmers were glad to have their wood lots cleared free of expense, and to give the wood to those who desired it for fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How the Steel Company Works the Dole</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">E STILL work the dole crudely in America. In the Pittsburgh district, when a former worker for the steel trust needs relief he is sent to the steel company, which issues necessary food and clothing, but he has to sign a promise to repay the cost of these things out of his earnings as soon as a job is again available. The longer the depression lasts, the more completely the one-time worker is licked, and the less likely he is to move or to seek to better his condition in any way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font4">HE lectures of Judge Rutherford, broadcast over many radio stations, have created a world-wide interest. This booklet contains three of such lectures. Because it is appropriate the title given to the booklet is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">THE CRISIS.</span><span class="font4"> A crisis means a turning point marking the end of a bad condition and the beginning of a better condition. All persons of good will gladly welcome such a change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For many years the people of America pointed with pride to this nation and declared it must endure for ever. In more recent years conditions have grown very oppressive and unhappy and many have wondered as to the reason why. The radio lecture ‘ ‘ Can the American Government Endure?” brings the matter squarely before all thinking people. Therein is produced the evidence showing the reason why the American government cannot endure. It discloses the reason for oppression and suffering, why it must end, and why it will be succeeded by a better condition. It is not the expression of a man’s opinion. Based upon the indisputable evidence it shows that the crisis of the American government is now at hand. Study it carefully, together with your Bible, and you will appreciate the force of the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For more than eighteen centuries the true followers of Christ Jesus have been persecuted because of their faithfulness to God. Many have wondered why this persecution should come upon those trying to serve the Lord. A crisis has now come when persecution shall cease and all shall know that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is at hand. The lecture “Jehovah’s witnesses: Why Persecuted?” will open your mind to the true situation and disclose that those W’ho serve God’s kingdom have and exercise true wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From time immemorial selfishness has dominated the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">world and has caused great suffering. The very opposite of selfishness is love, which is properly defined as “the perfect expression of unselfishness”. A crisis has been reached in the predominance of selfishness, and now it soon shall cease and unselfishness shall rule the world, bringing comfort and peace to the people. Those who live on earth will learn to do right. The contents of this booklet will give you real</span></p>
