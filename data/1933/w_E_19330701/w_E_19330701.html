<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him, upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gog is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font3"> angry concerning the kingdom message that is being broadcast by radio, and is making a desperate effort to stop the same. It seems clear that Jehovah has provided the transcription machines for the very purpose of checking the enemy’s efforts. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses are now provided with these machines and are using them in halls, parks and other public places with telling effect. Three hundred machines are already provided for America, and Canada and England have a proportionately good number. These are a part of the equipment for making known the kingdom. For particulars, write the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been the custom of the Society for the Bethel home and the factory at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, to close two weeks during each year so as to allow the brethren a change from their steady occupation. The period during which everything will be shut down this year is August 21 to September 4 inclusive. Many are arranging to spend the greater part of their time in the witness work in the vicinity where they are going. During these two weeks no orders will be filled or correspondence answered. All companies, pioneers, auxiliaries and sharpshooters should make a careful check of their stock so that they will have sufficient on hand during this period and for several weeks thereafter. The Society will appreciate it very much if correspondence that is not urgent be not written until sometime after September 4, so that the mail that has accumulated during the closed-factory period can be dispatched promptly upon reopening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AMBASSADORS’ DEVOTIONAL PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has again, through his organization, arranged that a special effort be put forth by lus witnesses to spread the kingdom message. July 1-9 inclusive is designated as Ambassadors’ Devotional Period, and during this time books and booklets that pertain to Jehovah’s purposes will be offered to the people. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Costs</span><span class="font3"> booklet especially should be stressed, and an effort made to leave one of these booklets in every home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society is pleased to note that during the last Testimony Period, in April, the workers in the field far exceeded any number previously engaged in the witness work. Evidently those people of good will, the Jonadab class, are saying, •'Come and drink of the water of life freely.” We should welcome all of good will to participate in the proclamation of the kingdom during this special season, July 1-9. Be sure you are well supplied with literature.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>HIS SANCTUARY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 8:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH causes his enemies to identify themselves so that their mouths are for ever estopped ”■ to complain'against his righteous judgment. Then he serves notice upon them of his purpose to execute judgment, that they may have an opportunity to know in advance what will be their end and, above all, to know that Jehovah is the Almighty God over the whole universe. He caused his prophet Daniel to foretell a time coming when there would arise in the earth a great power, built up by and under the control of Satan, which would practice fraud and deceit, persecute the faithful people of God, magnify itself against the Prince of Peace, take away the “continual sacrifice”, and cast down his sanctuary to the ground. The seventh chapter of Daniel’s prophecy, considered in a preceding issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> identifies the Anglo-American empire system, which is “Christendom”, as the “little horn”, which speaks great things against Jehovah and his kingdom, which hopes to change times and the laws of God, and which wears out the saints of the Most High. The eighth chapter of Daniel’s prophecy further identifies the same wicked system, called “Christendom”, as the one who treads down the sanctuary and takes away the continual sacrifice, and also discloses when the sanctuary is cleansed and what shall be the final result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• In the first year of Belshazzar’s reign Daniel had a vision of four beasts and another beast. Three years later he had a vision which is detailed in the eighth chapter of that prophecy, at which time he was at Shushan by the river Ulai, and which relates to the same matter in general. The vision is recorded at Daniel 8: 3-12, which the student should now carefully read before considering what is here said. Daniel sought an understanding of the vision: ‘ ‘ And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.” (Dan. 8:15,16) This shows that the understanding of the prophetic vision is given by Jehovah by and through his mighty Son Christ, the Head of the temple class.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Gabriel came near to Daniel and said: “Understand, 0 son of man; for at the time of the end shall be the vision.” (Dan. 8:17) That time of the end dates from and after 1914, and the seventeenth verse proves that the vision could not be fulfilled or understood prior to 1914. “And he [Gabriel] said, Behold, I will make thee [that is, the class whom Daniel pictured, to wit, the remnant] know what shall be in the last end [latter time, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.] of</span><span class="font4"> the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be. ” (Dan. 8:19) Jehovah’s indignation is against Satan and his organization ; and the proof shows that the seventh world power has prospered above any other part of Satan’s visible organization. The prosperity of such world power continues until “the indignation be accomplished”, showing that it is the last world power that does prosper. “The king [seventh world power, the Anglo-American imperialistic system] shall . . . prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that that is determined shall be done.” (Dan. 11:36) This shows that with the fall of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ prosperity and wickedness of this wicked organization will cease. “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.” (Isa. 26: 20) “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” —Zeph. 3: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah then in advance writes some of the history of Satan’s organization leading up to the ‘ ‘ abomination that maketh desolate”. “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia; and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">king.” (Dan. 8:20,21) Medo-Persia was the fourth world power, and Greece the fifth, and the latter was baser than the fourth, even as a shaggy goat is baser than a ram. Alexander the Great was the king with the great “horn between his eyes”, and with his army of thirty thousand troops overran the Persian empire. Alexander died at Babylon in 323 B.C., and four divisions of the empire followed, with Ptolemy in Egypt, Seleucus in Asia, Lysimachus in Asia Minor, and Cassander in Macedonia. Says the prophet: “Now that [Alexander the Great] being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.” (Dan. 8:22) None of the four powers above mentioned was as strong or powerful as Alexander. Macedonia was made a Roman province in 146 B.C., and in the same year Greece was reduced to the same condition. In 133 B.C. Rome acquired Attalus’ dominions, and the province of Asia was formed out of these territories so acquired. The four kingdoms that stood up, therefore, were not in the power of the Grecian empire under Alexander.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> Gabriel in giving an explanation of this vision to Daniel passes over the decline of the Grecian world power and that of the Roman world power and directs attention immediately to the seventh world power. Thus he spans the time from Alexander’s death down to the 17th century, and this emphasizes the importance of the seventh world power as it appears in this vision and as it relates to God’s holy people. Note in Daniel 8: 8 the prophecy says: “And for it came up four notable ones, toward the four winds of heaven.” The horn toward the west wind (America) was the one that led to the development of the seventh world power. This Gabriel explains to Daniel in the following words: “And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors [transgressions, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.] </span><span class="font4">are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.” (Dan. 8:23) The proof submitted in explanation of the seventh chapter of Daniel’s prophecy shows that the ‘‘king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences”, here mentioned in the twenty-third verse of the eighth chapter, is the Anglo-American empire system, which is “Christendom”. This is exactly in harmony with Daniel 8:9, which says: “And out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.” The “little horn” of this verse nine is the Anglo-American empire system with the little island of England as the central pivot and is appropriately named ‘ ‘ Great Britain”. As a world power it really started at the beginning of the 17th century when the queen of that nation chartered the East India Company. Only a short time thereafter, to wit, A.D. 1607, the first permanent English settlement was founded at Jamestown, Virginia, and that was the beginning of the thirteen colonics of Britain in America, and for years these thirteen colonies were an integral part of the British empire. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> 1921, page 12) The imperialism of the United States of America began with the Monroe Doctrine, in 1823. (See the proof, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font4">Book One, page 287; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 325.) At the present date (1933) the United States has possessions east, west, north and south, and by reason of the Monroe Doctrine the United States dominates South America, and together with Great Britain she controls the finances of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> In harmony with the above, note that the “little horn”, which Daniel saw, “waxed exceeding great”: Beginning with little England, she became the twohorned beast of Revelation 13:11, one horn standing for Great Britain and her dominions, and the other horn standing for the United States and her possessions. Ireland was never a world power and could not be considered as one of the horns. Now noting the directions mentioned in Daniel 8:9: “ Toward the south” means the African continent, and “toward the east” means India, Australia and New Zealand, and “toward the pleasant land” manifestly means Palestine, which is called “the glory of all lands”. (Ezek. 20: 6,15) It is also written: “He shall enter also into the glorious land.” (Dan. 11:41) In the year 1869 Great Britain built the Suez Canal, and in 1882 that nation obtained possession of the Persian Gulf, and in 1882 Egypt was invaded by the British. The fact that the prophecy mentions south, east and “the pleasant land” implies that Great Britain pushed also in other directions, and the facts are that Great Britain is in the west and north, whereas the United States is in the remote west. Thus is further identified the “little horn” “beast”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Gabriel interprets this part of the prophecy to Daniel and says: “A king of fierce countenance [strong face, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.,</span><span class="font4"> margin], and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.” (Dan. 8:23) Surely this represents the British Empire system. “What is stronger than a lion?” (Judg. 14:18) Great Britain symbolizes itself as a lion, whereas the United States symbolizes herself as a ravenous, fierce and sharp-taloned eagle. These two nations form the ‘two-horned beast’, and which shows itself to be exactly as the prophet has here described. “Understanding dark sentences” well describes the diplomacy of the British Empire, which has never been equaled by any other power under the sun.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The greatest world power that has ever existed is that of the Anglo-American empire system, and the Devil, to be sure, has made it so great. Concerning this Daniel prophesied in vision: “And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.” (Dan. 8:10) Gabriel, interpreting this part of the prophecy, in the twentyfourth verse says: “And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power.” The prophecy of Revelation explains whence comes this great power, in these words: “And the beast, which I saw . . . the dragon [Satan the Devil] gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. ’ ’ The peoples of the nations have been astounded at the wide-flung power exercised by the little British Isles, which are the center of the British Empire. That subtle world power has compelled the overawed natives of various nations to slave for it and make it rich, and by its ill-got gold, its devilish diplomacy, and cunning oppression, has maintained its grip upon many divisions of earth’s population.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Further explaining the vision Gabriel says that “he [the seventh world power] shall destroy wonderfully”. The Hebrew word here rendered “destroy” is also rendered “corrupt”, and “mar”. The Anglo-American imperialism has marred, corrupted and destroyed many of the peoples of the earth. The hordes of India, the Boers of South Africa, the corrupted Chinese, and many others testify to the truth of this statement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Returning to verse ten, note the statement: “It waxed great, even to the host of heaven.” The Hebrew word here rendered ‘ ‘ host ’ ’ is also rendered ‘ ‘ warfare”, “service.” (See the following proof texts: Genesis 2:1; Psalm 33: 6; Exodus 12: 41.) Undoubtedly “the host” here means those whom Jehovah has called to the heavenly calling, of whom Christ Jesus the King is the Head and Prince. Not only has the Anglo-American imperialism exalted itself to the starry hosts of heaven, but these arrogantly exercise power against Jehovah’s anointed people, and against the cause of his kingdom, and have vigorously tried to prevent the people from hearing God’s Word of truth. In support of this conclusion reference is made to Gabriel’s interpretation of the above, when he says, in verse twenty-four: “And shall prosper and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font4"> people of the holy ones].” Concerning this same world power the prophecy of Daniel's vision in the seventh chapter is: “And the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them: until the Ancient of days came.” (Dan. 7:21,22,25,26) This proves that the oppressive power of the Anglo-American imperialism, particularly against the people of the Holy One, will continue until the final judgment is executed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The “little horn” that has grown into the Anglo-American imperialistic system magnifies itself against the Lord God and his kingdom. Daniel 8:11 states: “Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host.” Without any question of doubt this reference is to the great Prince of Peace, the King of kings and Lord of lords. In this day of Jehovah, when the great Prince has taken his power and reigns, and in which time all the nations are lining up under the command of the Devil for Armageddon, how foolish it is to apply this prophecy to the papacy alone. It is true that the papacy forms a part of “Christendom” and hence is a part of this devilish power; but the application could not be to the papacy here, but is to that wicked and oppressive and subtle power, the British-American imperialism. It was in 1914 that Michael, the great Prince, stood up and began his reign. (Dan. 12:1) Therefore the prophecy of Daniel 8:11 could not possibly have had application prior to 1914, at which time the papacy exercised very little power. Within the realm of “Christendom” the papacy and Protestantism work hand in hand together with the other ruling factors of Satan’s organization and together constitute the Devil religion labeled “organized Christianity”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Mark how well the facts show that it is the Anglo-American imperialism, the chief part of “Christendom”, that magnifies itself against Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace and “the Prince of the host”. Interpreting this eleventh verse of the eighth chapter of Daniel, Gabriel said to Daniel, in verse twenty-five: “And through his policy [cunning, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font4"> also he shall cause craft [deceit, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font4"> to prosper in his hand.” There is no nation that has used so much crafty diplomacy to further its interests as that of the seventh world power; and by this means it has greatly prospered. The League of Nations is a modem masterpiece of this devilish diplomacy or craft and deceit, and is set up against the kingdom of God and therefore against the Prince of Peace. The Anglo-American imperialism by its diplomacy concocted that devilish makeshift called the League of Nations and put it across. The president of the United States got the credit for the formation of the League, but in fact it was formulated by British citizens. To his dying hour the president of the United States tried to force the American people into the League.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Furthermore, it was the diplomatic practice of the seventh world power that provoked the grasping and blood-thirsty Prussians to devilish jealousy, and which brought on the World War and resulted in the destruction of so many human lives. Gabriel further says of the ‘two-horned beast’, which is the familiar name for the Anglo-American imperialism: ‘ ‘ And he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font4"> prosperity] shall destroy many.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> renders this part of the text: “By their careless security will he destroy many.” It is well known that following the World War there came within the borders of the seventh world power a most unprecedented time of commercial prosperity. A new crop of millionaires came into existence which were made possible by the fraudulent practices indulged in by the wrongful use of the people’s money during the World War. All kinds of commercial schemes were put forth, particularly from 1920 to 1929, at which latter date the great world depression started, and since then many people have been destroyed. Many who becama reasonably wealthy by following other crafty leaders and who in the depression lost all they had committed suicide. Numbers of the consecrated during that period became careless of their covenant with the Lord and indulged in many speculative schemes and prospered ; and because of their love for money such have lost their vision of God’s purposes and have perished, being ‘drowned in the sea’. (1 Tim. 6:9,10; Prov. 1:32; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 221) God’s elect have not been deceived by these subtle things, but have continued to faithfully give the testimony.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The seventh world power continues to ‘ ‘ stand up against the Prince of princes ’ ’ by steadfastly resisting the great fact that the Gentile times ended in 1914 and that Christ Jesus is now present, and that he is earth’s rightful King, and that all should bow to him. (Rev. 11:15) By the making of the League of Nations and various peace treaties, the holding of conferences, and completely ignoring the truth concerning God’s kingdom, and like things, the Anglo-American imperialism continues to oppose the kingdom of God. Furthermore it is within the Anglo-American empire system, “Christendom,” that Jehovah’s witnesses are strenously opposed even to this day. England forbids the message of the kingdom of God to be broadcast by radio within her borders, and Canada has now interfered. She not only has denied the license of stations owned by God’s people to broadcast the truth, but has now issued an order that the truth of God’s Word and kingdom shall not be broadcast except by its permission. It freely admits that the clergy of the English church, or the religious element, is back of this effort to prevent the people from understanding the message of the kingdom, and thus they openly “stand up against the Prince” and against his kingdom. This arrogant censorship sets itself against the Lord and against his anointed, even as the Lord God foretold would be done. In support of the conclusion that the hypocritical clergy, who falsely claim to represent God, are the ones who are leading the opposition to Christ and his kingdom, the following quotation is from the public press of Canada of recent date, to wit:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Hector Charlesworth, chairman of the radio commission, stated a dignified complaint had been received from a group of Anglican clergymen in Saint John”;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and that press report names some clergymen who protest, as follows: Rev. Canon R. P. McKim, rector of St.Luke’s; Rev. W. C. V. Martin, rector of St. Mary’s, and Rev. T. Hudson Steward, rector of St. John’s (Stone) Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE DAILY SACRIFICE”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> It has long been understood by true followers of Christ Jesus that the institution of the mass by the papacy fulfilled the prophecy concerning ‘the taking away of the daily sacrifice’. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> Vol. Three, page 100.) Neither the facts nor the prophecy support this conclusion. ‘ ‘ Organized Christianity” from its beginning has really been the Devil religion parading under the false title “Christianity”, and this is proved by the indisputable facts now well known to those who are devoted to the Lord. The true followers of Christ were never popular with Satan’s world, and never could be, because Jesus so plainly stated: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 15:19) In the face of this Scriptural truth “organized Christianity” became the popular religion of the realm called ‘ ‘ Christendom”, and is yet so. The emperor of the sixth world power, Constantine the First, who was the representative of Satan on earth, adopted the religion which he named “Christian religion”, and by which many persons have been deceived. That he was directed by Satan to do this is proved by the following facts: “In the campaign in Italy he saw, it is said, a flaming cross in the heavens, beneath the sun, bearing the inscription, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘In hoc signo vinces’</span><span class="font4"> (Under this sign thou shalt conquer). He accordingly caused a standard to be made in this form, which was called the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">labarum.</span><span class="font4"> ... He was declared by the Senate chief, Augustus, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pontifex maximus.</span><span class="font4"> In the year 313, together with Licinius, he published the memorable edict of toleration in favor of the Christians. . . . This edict marks the period of the triumph of the cross and the downfall of paganism.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Americana,</span><span class="font4"> Vol. 7, page 554.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> That marked the beginning of ‘ ‘ organized Christianity” which since then has been labeled “the papacy” and “Protestantism”, both of which have formed a part of the organization of this world, which is Satan’s organization, and both of which operate within the realm now called “Christendom”; and both are called “Christian”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> That part of the prophecy concerning the ‘ ‘ daily sacrifice” calls for a careful consideration in view of what God’s people now know of the Devil’s organization. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font4"> (Dan. 8:11) reads: “And by him </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font4"> from him] the daily sacrifice was taken away.” According to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version </span><span class="font4">the rendering of the text is: “And it [the beastly world power] took away from him the continual burnt-offering.” This prophecy clearly refers to something that is based upon the ransom sacrifice, growing out of it and in addition thereto, to wit, the daily, continual presentation of the bodies of God’s faithful servant class, publicly giving testimony to the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom. This conclusion is fully supported by the text cited below ; and before citing that, mark that the British-American empire system, which is “Christendom”, in which both Catholics and Protestants operate together, did take away the daily presentation of the testimony of Jehovah and his kingdom, and did thus cast down the sanctuary class to the ground; and this was done in the year 1918. That we may more fully appreciate this part of the prophecy the Scriptural meaning of the “continual burnt-offering” is considered in the light of the texts that follow:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The Hebrew word is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tah-meed,</span><span class="font4"> and is translated “daily” and also “continual”. According to the texts that follow it has to do with the constant service by the Levites or consecrated servants of the Lord. * ‘ Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron, for the service of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God. And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and likewise at even ■ and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the Lord, in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the Lord.” (1 Chron. 23:28,30,31) “And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon, to offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually, morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel. ’ ’ (1 Chron. 16:39,40) “.vnd he cried, A lion [as a lion, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin]</span><span class="font4"> : My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights. ’ ’—Isa. 21: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah’s servants are not to cease voluntarily their testimony, but must continually present it. “I have set watchmen upon thy walls, 0 Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence.” (Isa. 62:6) “Wait on thy God continually.” (Hos. 12: 6) “I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.” (Ps. 34:1) “My praise shall be continually of thee.” (Ps. 71: 6) These scriptures written aforetime are to be specially applied to the consecrated people of God at the end of the world, and in each one of them the same Hebrew word is used and translated “continually” that is used in Daniel 8:11 and translated by the word “daily”. It is also further supported by texts in the New Testament concerning the continual offering unto the Lord, as shown by the following:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The faithful servants of God must continually offer their sacrifice. “By him [Christ Jesus, the great high priest who offered himself as a ransom sacrifice] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” (Hcb. 13:15) Without a question of doubt this refers to the continual and faithful service of the anointed in proclaiming the name and Word of Jehovah God and his kingdom and thus singing forth his praises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Note also the following texts: “And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.” (Luke 24:53) “And daily in the temple, and in every house [as proclaiming from house to house the message, as Jehovah’s witnesses now do] they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.” (Acts 5:42) “I die daily.” (1 Cor. 15:31) “The Son of God abideth a priest continually.”—Heb. 7: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> It is by him, this faithful Priest, that his true followers continue to offer their offering unto the Lord in righteousness. The prophecy here under consideration, as heretofore shown, must have its fulfilment “in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full ’ ’.—Dan. 8: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> It is true that both Catholic and Protestant divisions of “Christendom” have by their creeds and course of action denied the value of the ransom sacrifice and have grossly blasphemed the name of God and of Christ Jesus; but, when confronted with the matter, both claim to believe in Christ Jesus; and it is this Devil-organized religion that has magnified the material thing, the cross, and has thus misled and deceived millions of people. The foregoing facts directly connect the “sign of the cross” from Constantine’s time with the use of the “cross” as a symbol, even unto the present day; and all of these facts show a blasphemous course taken by ‘ ‘ organized Christianity ’ ’; but it does not have reference to the fulfilment of Daniel 8:11. Furthermore, we know that not for one moment could these religious systems of the seventh world power, or any other, for that matter, halt the continual imputation of the merit of the ransom sacrifice to God’s faithful people. By the institution of the mass it would be impossible to take away the merit of the ransom sacrifice and the continual imputation thereof to all who are truly devoted to God by faith in Christ Jesus. Even though it be said that the mass is substituted as the sacrifice of Christ, this in no wise could affect the real value or merit of Christ Jesus’ sacrifice. To be sure, the Devil himself denies the value of the ransom sacrifice, and has done so from the very time of Jesus’ death, but it could not be said that “the continual burnt-offering”, or “daily sacrifice”, was thus taken away. According to the facts now well known and in harmony with the Scriptural meaning of the words “daily sacrifice” and “continual burnt-offering” this matter becomes clear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> During the World War England, Canada, the United States and other parts of the Anglo-American empire system did stop the public witness work from being done by Jehovah’s saints on the earth. Thus, in harmony with the prophecy, “by him [that is, the ‘little horn’, Anglo-American imperialism] ” there was taken away from God’s true people “the continual burnt-offering”, that is to say, the continual daily service and praise to Jehovah God. (Heb. 13:15) The World War, which began in 1914, furnished this opportunity, and in 1918 the freedom to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom was taken away and many of Jehovah’s witnesses were confined in prison. The very language of the prophecy shows that it must apply to the time when the Lord appears at his temple, because it was at the temple or tabernacle that the burnt offering was daily offered continually, both morning and evening; and since offerings are made in connection with the tabernacle or temple, this prophecy applies at the time of the setting up of the temple, which occurred in 1918. The one who takes away this continual burnt offering is the one that ‘ waxes great ’, and ‘magnifies himself against the Prince of the host’, the one that ‘has the fierce countenance and understanding of dark sentences’; all of which descriptive words, as appears from the foregoing proof, show that it is the Anglo-American imperial system, the chief part of “Christendom”, which must accomplish this wicked thing, and which did accomplish it, as above stated.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“CAST DOWN”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The sanctuary of Jehovah is his capital organization composed of Christ Jesus, the Head, and the members of his body, anointed to be kings and priests unto God, and of necessity must include the faithful “feet” members on the earth. “And the place of his sanctuary was cast down.” (Dan. 8:11) The “place” is the base, or fixed place. The Hebrew word translated “place” is used of things pertaining to Jehovah and his service. The “place”, or base, of his sanctuary would be the faithful covenant people of God on the earth, and who are the feet members of the anointed One. (Ezra 2: 68; 1 Ki. 8:13) The remnant are the very lowest part or ones of Jehovah’s sanctuary class, therefore the base. The casting down must necessarily refer to the faithful members of Christ Jesus’ body while on the earth, because the enemy has been cleared out of heaven at the time of the casting down, and there could be no such thing as casting down Jehovah’s organization from heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The facts fully support this conclusion. During the World War the faithful members of God’s organization on earth were cast down and the servants of Satan profaned God’s sanctuary, which is the dwelling place by his spirit; and this the enemy did by suppressing their service and oppressing and imprisoning and otherwise degrading Jehovah’s sanctuary people on the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The taking away of the continual sacrifice, the casting down of the sanctuary, and the setting up of the abomination, take place practically at the same time. “And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.” (Dan. 11:31) This means that the commercial element, military power, and strong-arm squad, supported by the religious “arms”, or power, of the seventh world power, and all of these fully supported by the king or political ruling power, all of which acted at the dictation of the Devil, did “pollute the sanctuary of strength”, which is Jehovah’s sanctuary, because he is their strength. (2 Sam. 22: 33; Neh. 8:10) Instead of accepting Christ Jesus as the top stone or head of Jehovah’s organization and becoming submissive to his rule, the Anglo-American empire system, that is, “Christendom,” rejected his kingdom and cast the Word of God behind them and to the ground. (Ps. 50:17) In the place and stead of the kingdom of God under Christ that seventh world-power system brought forth and set up the League of Nations, which is an abomination in Jehovah’s sight. It east the kingdom of God away and, in effect, said: ‘This man-made thing, the League of Nations, shall rule the world.’ At the time of bringing forth the League of Nations compact the faithful people of God on earth had been “cast down” to the earth, and their opportunity to offer the continual or daily sacrifice of praise and service to Jehovah and his kingdom was taken away, and Jehovah’s name was therefore defamed. Thus “arms [did] stand on his part”, the Devil’s seventh world power’s, and did “take away the daily sacrifice”, and did set up the abomination that maketh desolate, even as the prophet had foretold.—Dan. 11:31.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“PRACTISED AND PROSPERED”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> By exalting the League of Nations the seventh world power has committed a great transgression. In doing this it is supported by the commercial element, the military power, the strong-arm squad, the clergy, and the political dupes, and this host is provided by the Devil to oppose and to destroy the truth and those who proclaim the truth. “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font4"> the host was given over for the transgression against the daily sacrifice], and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.” (Dan. 8:12) Manifestly the meaning here is that “an host”, or military watch, is provided to prevent the continual praise and service to Jehovah by his faithful people; and this did occur within the realms of “Christendom”, which was the only place where Jehovah’s witnesses were persecuted and cast down; and in carrying out this wicked work Protestant and Catholic clergymen cooperated fully with the other agencies of Satan. God’s anointed people now rejoice to have an understanding hereof, because it is further evidence that they are right and are serving Jehovah, and hence they can see that these things were written aforetime for their comfort and that their hope might grow strong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> The seventh world power, which began with the “little horn”, has wonderfully “practised and prospered”. By the practice of diplomacy, hypocrisy, fraud and deceit, and by the excessive use of military and naval power, that kingdom has greatly prospered. Look at Africa, Asia, the American continent, and to the isles of the sea, and in each and all of these appears the material prosperity of the seventh world power. The commercial, military, naval, political, diplomatic and religious crowd have prospered together, and this has caused great wonder and astonishment in the minds of honest people of the earth. It is within the realms of the seventh world power that Jehovah has caused the witnessing of the truth to be specially given, and it is within that same realm that the forces of Satan have cast the truth to the ground. In all this they have held the Devil religion, fraudulently labeled “■Christianity”, up before honest people to blind them to the really nefarious work of the enemy organization. Satan causes his chief officer, Gog, to organize a conspiracy against the people of Jehovah, and it is within the realms of the seventh world power, or “Christendom”, that overt acts in furtherance of this conspiracy have been and are now being committed in opposition to God and to his kingdom. That wicked conspiracy was formed about the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah, and has been engaged actively in committing overt acts against God’s anointed people since that time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Satan well knew that the day must come when the great issue of supremacy must be settled, and he prepared for it. It is now apparent that Satan’s purpose was to destroy the human race in preference to seeing Christ Jesus rule the world, and for this reason he plunged the nations into the World War. Commerce is the strongest part of Satan’s visible organization. It is the greed for gain among the people that has made the commercial part of Satan’s organization most powerful. The Anglo-American empire system has prospered commercially beyond any other power that has ever been on the earth. This commercial progress produced a wicked jealousy amongst the various nations of “Christendom”, which Satan manipulated for the very purpose of destroying the human race. Satan induced his servant, the ex-kaiser of Germany, and his blood-thirsty Prussian aides, to believe that he, the kaiser, was the heaven-appointed one to become supreme in the earth and to destroy all that opposed. Imbued with this thought the Prussians set about to conquer the world, and at the same time Satan was playing the diplomacy of Britain against that of Germany and brought on the clash to accomplish his wicked purposes. Doubtless Satan had some information as to the time Jehovah would place his King, Christ Jesus, upon the throne and send him forth to rule, and hence Satan maneuvered his forces accordingly. By 1914 Germany had built a mighty sea power second only to that of the Anglo-American empire. Germany had organized military forces that many then thought to be the greatest on earth. In the meantime and up to the “time of the end” both Germany and Great Britain were preparing for the great conflict which Satan had in mind. Exactly on time in 1914 Germany, under the direction of the invisible lord Satan, moved her military forces to the front, and the great World War was on. The British Empire, knowing what was coming, was prepared and was on the front ready to engage in battle. For four years the deadly conflict continued, and would not have stopped before the nations were destroyed, if Satan could have controlled the entire situation. That war ended with no decisive victory for either side, and no one could give a real reason why it ended at the time it did stop.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> The Great General, Christ Jesus, the Executive Officer of the Most High, at the command of Jehovah, took a hand in the matter and maneuvered the forces so that the war was brought to an end in 1918. Was that done for the purpose of saving the wicked from slaughter? Most assuredly not! The Lord stopped that war for his own purposes and, as Jesus had previously declared, “for the elect’s sake.” The continual sacrifice or burnt offering had been taken away from Jehovah’s faithful ones, and they had suffered persecution to the defamation of Jehovah’s name. Now Jehovah has made it plain to his people that before his time of going forth to destroy Satan’s organization he would have his anointed servants, which he had selected for his name’s sake, bear his testimony before the rulers and the peoples of the world. For this reason Jehovah caused the war to stop, and he has sent forth his witnesses, who have delivered and continue to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ more forcefully than ever human creatures have done in previous times. While this witness work has progressed within the realms of the Anglo-American empire system, which is “Christendom”, the wicked element has continued to oppose and has trod under foot Jehovah’s witnesses. These faithful witnesses are denounced, persecuted, fined and thrown into prison, and would be instantly destroyed now were it not for the protecting care given them by the Almighty God. The Anglo-American empire system continues to boast of its power and continues to stand up against the kingdom of Jehovah and his King. Nearly two decades have passed since the World War ended and still the Anglo-American imperial system continues to wickedly ‘practice and prosper’. Let all take notice, however, that this old wicked world system now stands on the brink of the most terrible trouble and slaughter that has ever been dreamed of and the like of which never will be known again.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“BROKEN”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Jehovah has caused his message to be brought to the attention of the rulers of the earth and notice to be served upon them that Christ Jesus is King. Never again can they plead ignorance of this great truth. If “Christendom”, that is, the Anglo-American empire system, were sincere in the claim of being Christian, that world power would give its allegiance to earth's rightful King. But by fraud and hypocrisy fraudulent “Christianity” blinds the people and continues to stand up against the Prince of Peace and to put forth efforts to suppress the truth. But let God’s people be assured that this wicked element cannot prevail. The end of the Anglo-American empire system is near at hand. It shall fall within a short time and utterly perish. Will it be crushed by the combined armies and navies of the other nations of the world? Will internal dissension of the masses against the classes develop into revolution and anarchy and cause its destruction ? The answer to these questions, based upon the Scriptures, is emphatically, No! because the destruction coming about in this manner eould bring no honor or vindication to Jehovah’s name. The vindication of Jehovah’s name is the greatest of all things. Jehovah’s messenger, Gabriel, in explaining to Daniel the meaning of the prophecy, said of and concerning this mighty cruel and oppressive Anglo-American imperial system, which is “Christendom”, this, to wit: “He shall be broken without hand.” (Dan. 8:25) Let the commercial giants, the political big and small men, the austere, pious-faced, hypocritical clergymen, and all their dupes, now take notice that in the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which shall be led by Christ Jesus the King, he will utterly destroy this mighty instrument of Satan which is now used to crush the truth and to defame Jehovah’s name. No earthly power will break this devilish system, but it shall be broken without the hand of man, that is to say, by the hand of Almighty God. This knowledge thrills the heart of each one of the anointed and causes them to continue to sing Jehovah’s praise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses have every reason to rejoice and be glad. Our heavenly Father is unfolding his prophecies now in harmony with his promise to increase the hope of his anointed ones. These faithful ones will take no part in the execution of God’s wrath against the wicked systems, except to sing the praises of Jehovah and serve notice. They are now fully assured, however, that all opposition to the truth put forth by the rulers in “Christendom” soon will be taken away by the complete fall of the devilish system. Jehovah’s sanctuary class must be clean and remain entirely so while singing the praises of Jehovah God. Members of this class can maintain their integrity only by faithfully giving heed to every commandment of the Lord. The Greater Moses is in command, and every one of Jehovah’s organization must be diligent to obey him. The prophecy of Daniel then discloses one saint propounding to another the appropriate question, and that question is appropriate to this very time. It therefore seems certain that it is God’s due time for his remnant people to have an understanding of the question propounded. “Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?” (Dan. 8:13) What, then, is the meaning of ‘the twenty-three hundred days’ and ‘the cleansing of the sanctuary’?</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>BEGINNING OF GOD’S KINGDOM</span></h1>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">I</span><span class="font4">N THE Hebrew Scriptures, provided and preserved by Jehovah for the information of people now living upon earth, there is a remarkable prophecy concerning a certain marvelous work that is now being carried forward in all the world. This work, which in recent years had but a small beginning, is daily gathering momentum and spreading into every nook and corner of the globe. What is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Foretelling the work of setting up his government, God, through his prophet, said: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.” (Isa. 28:16) In this scripture the word “stone” represents or symbolizes God’s Anointed King. The laying of the stone means the presentation of Jesus Christ, God’s Anointed One, as King. The presentation is made to those who profess to be the children of the Lord. This prophecy had a miniature fulfilment in A. D. 33, just three and one-half years after the Lord was anointed. At that time Jesus rode into Jerusalem and offered himself as King to the Jews, who claimed to be God’s people. At that time he had been tried and tested and at that moment was being offered as King, as represented by the laying of the stone, and he was rejected. This prophecy had a broader and complete fulfilment in 1918, when the Lord appeared at his temple. It was in 1914, as the proof shows, that God set his Anointed King upon his throne. This action is that which was foretold by Jehovah in Psalm 2, verse 6: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” The war in heaven there began, which furnished a great trial or test upon Jesus because he was engaged in a contest with Satan; and three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in 1918, Jesus came to his temple. He was there presented as King to those who professed to be the people of God. At the laying of the Corner Stone in miniature in A.D. 33 the clergy, as leaders of the people, and almost all the people of the Jews, rejected Christ Jesus as King, represented by the “chief corner stone”. Likewise in 1918, and following, the clergy of “organized Christianity” or “Christendom” rejected Jesus as King and chose in lieu thereof the League of Nations, which is a part of the Devil’s organization. At the first time that the Lord was presented, at the miniature fulfilment, a few of the Jews accepted him with gladness. At the complete fulfilment of the laying of the Corner Stone the truly anointed ones accepted him as King and rejoiced. In both instances the words of Jesus applied to those who failed or refused to receive him as King, to wit: “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits there-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">203</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">of. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. ”—Matt. 21: 42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who had brought forth the fruits of the kingdom by showing their full and faithful devotion to the Lord rejoiced to know of the laying of the Chief Corner Stone. These are represented as saying: ‘ * The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” —Ps. 118: 22-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Christ was presented as King at the coming to his temple he became “a stone of stumbling” to many, including so-called “organized Christianity” as a whole and many who claimed to be fully consecrated and devoted to the Lord. Some of these stumbled at the Stone and fell. Upon others the Stone fell and ground them to powder. The apostle Peter, referring to the same matter, said: “Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient; where-unto also they were appointed.” (1 Pet. 2:6-8) This is exactly as God’s 'prophet had foretold it would be. (Isa. 8:14) In harmony with these prophetic utterances the facts show that since 1918 so-called “organized Christianity” has rejected the Lord and his kingdom and has stumbled and fallen. The facts also show that many who claim to be really consecrated to the Lord have been unable to stand the test and have stumbled and fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the prophet Daniel, God describes his Anointed King as “the stone cut out of the mountain without hands”. The mountain is a symbol of God’s organization called Zion, out of which Christ, the Anointed One, comes. (Rom. 11: 26) It is this Stone, to wit, God’s Anointed King, that dashes to pieces Satan’s organization and establishes God’s government of righteousness amongst men.—Dan. 2: 35, 44, 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To sum up briefly, the facts show that God set his Anointed King upon his throne in 1914; that that marked the beginning of the setting up of his government ; that immediately followed a battle in heaven in which Satan was cast out; that three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, in 1918, the Lord came to his temple, having gathered his saints unto himself to take account with his servants and for judgment; that at that time Christ was presented as King to all those who claimed to be his followers, was rejected by many and joyfully received by others; and that these facts marked the progressive steps in the setting up</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of God’s government of earth. It had its beginning in 1914 and is still progressing. It was 1914 that marked the time of “the beginning of sorrows”, and the sorrows continue upon the world. At the same time the truly anointed ones are rejoicing, not because of the sorrows and sufferings upon human creatures, but in the fact that the day of deliverance is at hand and that this deliverance will come through God’s Anointed King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There must be a good reason for the Lord’s coming to his temple for the examination of Christians and for the test upon them. In the progressive work of the establishment of the kingdom or government on earth the Lord must have something for the approved ones to do. Do the Scriptures disclose what the approved ones are to do? and what are the present progressive steps in the setting up of God’s government of righteousness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is now doing a marvelous work among the people. That work he long ago foretold by his prophet and gave the reason for doing it. “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” (Isa. 29:13,14) That prophecy had a miniature fulfilment when Jesus was on earth. It is having a broader and complete fulfilment now since he has come to his temple. In the former days the Jewish clergy, made up of the Pharisees and their allies, caused the people to draw near to the Lord with their mouths, but their hearts were far removed from him. Today the denominational systems, following their leaders the clergy, draw near to God with their mouths, sing songs apparently to his praise, have prayers offered by some clergyman in the legislative bodies as well as in the church buildings, but the hearts of those who engage therein are not near the Lord. The precepts of men are followed and the Word of God is ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has given much outward evidence, that all who study his Word might understand that his kingdom is here; but this evidence is ignored by the clergy and their allies and they turn the people away therefrom. The clergy are deceiving many people, but, of course, they are not deceiving God nor retarding the marvelous work that the Lord God is doing. The time is here to do this work, and even though he employs the weakest instruments for his visible servants there is no power that can prevent that work from going on. Included in that marvelous work is the giving of the witness to the peoples of earth concerning Jehovah and his righteous government that is now being set up. So far as the visible work that is being done is concerned, it is not being done by those of any great reputation amongst men but, on the contrary, by the meek and lowly of heart. God has not committed his work to the great and honorable clergy, but he has committed it to a little company of despised ones in the world whose devotion is entirely to him. That makes it the more marvelous, because it is by the power of God manifested through imperfect men that results are being accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in 1914 that the great prophecy uttered by Jesus concerning the end of the world began to have its fulfilment. The World War, famine, pestilence, revolutions, and earthquakes coming one after the other, furnished good news to the faithful followers of Jesus. How could such terrible things be good news? Of course the suffering of the people brought no joy; but these things coming to pass as they had been foretold furnished the proof conclusive that the world had ended and the time had come for Christ, whose right it is, to begin his reign. That constituted the good news that gladdened the hearts of the faithful watchers. That was the beginning of the most momentous event of human history, because God’s government of righteousness had begun. It was the event for which the true followers of Jesus had been looking for more than 1800 years and about which the holy prophets testified more than four thousand years ago. To those followers of Jesus who saw the meaning of the events that began to take place in 1914 it was a time to laugh and dance for joy and to sing with grateful hearts the praise of God Almighty and the praise of his beloved Son who is earth’s rightful Governor. That song of gladness then begun by the faithful continues with increased fervency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not until after Jesus Christ came to his temple did even his most devoted followers have a clear vision concerning what they should do. It was in 1918 that the World War ceased, and the same year the Lord came to his temple. To those whom the Lord found faithful, and whom he constituted the “faithful and wise servant”, he gave flashes of lightning from the temple, that they might have a better understanding of what was expected of them. (Rev. 11:19) The wonderful things that had come to pass since 1914 furnished such great and good news to the faithful watchers that the words of Jesus came to them with a clearer understanding than ever before. The Lord stopped the World War for a purpose, and that purpose was to furnish the opportunity to the faithful to give proclamation of this good news to the people before the final end. Jesus said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) The real meaning of these words of the Anointed One could not be understood until after he came to his temple. When he said “this gospel” he meant the good news furnished by the fact that the world had ended and the time had come for Jehovah’s righteous government to be put in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here the Prince of Peace gave to his younger brethren the positive command that must be obeyed, and all who love him and love God will keep this commandment, and, keeping it, will have God’s special favor. (John 14: 21) The keeping of this commandment means to engage in the great and wonderful work which God is doing in the earth. Of what does that work consist? Jesus answers that it is good news that must be told to the people and nations of the earth as a witness to them. That means, of course, that somebody must testify before the peoples and rulers of the earth that Jehovah is the only true God and that he is the source of life and blessings. Notice must be served upon the rulers of the earth that the time has come for God’s government to take charge of the affairs of men. The “prisoners” in the various denominational systems must have an opportunity to hear the message of truth, that their hearts may be made glad. The people must have an opportunity to hear; and to this end the standard must be lifted up to them that they may understand that there are better conditions awaiting them in the very near future; and all this must be done before the “great day of God Almighty” in which Satan’s organization must go down.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE DEATH OF THE LAMB OF GOD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">I</span><span class="font4">T WAS “a band of men and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees ’ ’ which, under the guidance of the traitorous Judas Iscariot, proceeded to the garden of Gethsemane and there laid hold of Jesus, “the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.” The apostle Peter would have prevented the arrest of Jesus, but Jesus reproved him and bade him put up his sword in its sheath. “Then the band, and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, and led him away” to be tried before the Jewish religious authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The supreme court of the Jews was already convened, knowing beforehand that the arrest would be made. It was contrary to the law for that court to meet at night; but the priests and Pharisees and the doctors of the law, the rich men and the politicians composing that court, were now ready to ignore the law. The chief priests and the leaders, yea, all the religious leaders of the Jews, were there to aid and to abet the archconspirator Satan the Devil. So maliciously bent were they upon the destruction of Jesus that the clergy and their allies sought false witnesses against Jesus in order that they might put him to death. (Matt. 26:59) Members of that court, which court was supposed to be an august and righteous body, had now gone mad; because into their hearts the wicked one had planted wicked murder of the innocent. Being unable to find witnesses who were willing to testify to any wrongful act against Jesus, members of that devilish court, in utter violation of their own law and the rules of the court itself, compelled the defendant Jesus himself to give testimony. The high priest then made himself prosecutor and vehemently propounded this question: ‘ ‘ Tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.” (Matt. 26: 63) Jesus answered him: “Thou hast said.” Upon this testimony he was adjudged guilty of blasphemy, and the verdict of the court was: “He is guilty of death.” —Matt. 26: 63-66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When will the people learn the statement, long ago made by the inspired witness of God, that Satan is the god of this world and has blinded the minds of men? (2 Cor. 4: 3, 4) Is it not easy to be seen that when Satan desires even the courts of the land to wickedly do his bidding he can have it done? The Lord God will shortly permit the people to see that Jehovah is God and that his righteous way will completely deliver them. Let us, then, proceed with the examination of the outworking of God’s purpose, that we may have cause to rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The defenseless, harmless, righteous One stood before this court and was adjudged guilty of death; and that without a cause. Now he was led before the high political ruler for a confirmation of the sentence; and although that august ruler and ally of the profiteers and clergy found no wrong in Jesus, yet he had not the moral courage to turn him loose. Conditions are no different now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the supreme hour for the Devil to act, and he held a tight hand over all his servants who were then engaged in this wicked work. Yielding to the importunities of the clergy, the political chief formally consented to the sentence of death; and then, that he might free himself from the responsibility thereof, Pilate took water and in the presence of the people washed his hands and exclaimed: “I am innocent of the blood of this just person.” The Jews willingly took the blame upon themselves, and then Jesus was led away to be executed.—Matt. 27:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hypocrisy and mockery proceed from the Devil. No one having the spirit of the Lord would resort to such methods. Jesus had said: “I am the Son of God.” The enemy Satan, thinking he had Jesus now within his power, purposed to make the name of the Son of God despicable, and to have the mob mock him as such. The Devil knew that Jesus was the Son of God, and now to have him mocked would be a reproach to the Father. The enemy therefore induced his earthly representatives to go through many mocking ceremonies. They first put on Jesus a scarlet robe, which is a symbol of royalty; then they made him a crown of thorns and put that on his head as a symbol of authority; then they put a reed into his hand, a symbol of right to rule; and then they hypocritically bowed before him in worshipful attitude, and mockingly said: “Hail, King of the Jews!” Truly here were fulfilled the words of the prophet: “The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Ps. 69:9) The Devil was here reproaching Jehovah. He had been reproaching him all along, and now these reproaches had reached a climax and they were heaped upon his beloved Son Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not content with this, but with a further exhibition of malicious hatred on the part of Satan the enemy, his emissaries were induced to spit upon the Lord Jesus and to take the reed out of his hand and strike him with it. After going through these many ceremonies of mockery Jesus was again dressed in his own clothing and prepared by them to be crucified. As a further indignity upon his head vinegar was provided, mixed with gall, and given to him to drink. Then he was cruelly nailed to the tree and thus subjected to the most ignominious death known to man. While he was hanging upon the tree the chief priests and other members of the clergy further showed their malicious hatred by leading the mob and deriding and mocking the Lord Jesus. We see that God permitted Satan and his emissaries to go to the fullest extent of wickedness, and that then God made it known that he was taking cognizance of what was taking place and that with him resides all power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For three hours gross darkness covered the land. Thus the Lord Jehovah pictured that with the taking away of his beloved Son darkness would settle down over the world. At the end of that period of darkness Jesus cried with a loud voice and died. At the moment of Jesus’ death Jehovah caused the earth to quake. The mountains shook and the rocks were torn away. In the temple of Jerusalem there was a great curtain thirty feet long by thirty feet wide and four inches thick, which, at the moment of Jesus’ death, was rent in twain from top to bottom. (Matt. 27:51) Great fear and terror came upon those who were assigned to witness the crucifixion, when they saw this manifestation of Jehovah’s power. They said concerning Jesus: “Truly this was the Son of God.” Never before and never since was the death of a man marked by such a manifestation of power from Jehovah God. Again God was giving the people the lesson that Jehovah is God, and in due time some will benefit therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The body of Jesus was prepared for burial and laid in the newly prepared tomb of Joseph of Arimatluea. The heir to the throne of the kingdom of God was dead. With malicious glee the enemy Satan considered that he had won the long fight, and that now he was even greater than God. Thus ended the earthly ministry of the only true and good man that was ever on earth. He was without fault, without spot or blemish. He was holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners. He was the Son of God, and to this time he had faithfully performed his part in the divine purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In God’s due time a test must come to every man as to whether he loves righteousness and will obey God or prefers wickedness and will follow a wicked course. Every intelligent human creature must have an opportunity to exercise such free moral agency. The opportunity came to the scribes, Pharisees and others at the crucifixion of Jesus. Some of the Jews who participated in the death of Jesus were ignorant of the fact that he was the Son of God. Some of the rulers also were ignorant. (Acts 3:17) But the scribes, Pharisees and priests were not ignorant. Judas was not ignorant, and, of course, the Devil was not ignorant. The ignorant ones who sinned against the Lord God and against Christ Jesus will be forgiven. But those who knew that he was Christ sinned against the holy spirit. Jesus said: “A.nd whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the holy [spirit], it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. ’ ’—Matt. 12 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are those at this very day who know that Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords, and who know that there are a few humble ones on earth who are giving testimony of these facts to the common people. And yet these self-constituted “wise” men assume a sanctimonious air, parade in the name of the Lord Jesus and claim to represent him, but willfully sin against the light they have and persecute those who are calmly telling of God’s great purpose of salvation. The Lord Jesus referred to this selfsame class in the parable of the sheep and the goats. Telling how he would set the goat class to the left side, he said: ‘ ‘ Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. ’ ’—Matt. 25: 31-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To sin against the holy spirit does not mean to sin against a creature or person, but means to deliberately go contrary to the light of truth. The holy spirit is the invisible power of God that illuminates the minds of men. Therefore, to sin against the holy spirit means a willful and deliberate course contrary to one’s knowledge of what is right and wrong. One who sins against the holy spirit is possessed of a malicious heart; which means that such a one has no regard for the law of God, and no consideration for the rights of others, but is fatally bent on doing wickedness in order to accomplish a selfish purpose, and doing it knowingly.</span></p>
