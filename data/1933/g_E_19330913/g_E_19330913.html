<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The World’s Champion Conspirators Against Honesty</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">T THE moment, the conspiracy of Gog, the Devil’s prime minister, is under full swing to get Judge Rutherford off the air from every radio station in the United States that can be bullied, bluffed, cajoled or forced into going back on its contracts, and disappointing its patrons, by that institution of the Devil, the Roman Catholic church, that is now about to perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We who have been out in the door-to-door witness work, and who are out in it regularly, know that the people are with Judge Rutherford. With rare exceptions, they are all listening to him, no matter what church they attend, and this is especially true in cities where his talks have been a regular radio feature. To millions of Catholics, as well as others, his “comfort of the scriptures” (Romans 15:4) is comfort indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Visit their homes and you will know the reason why. Brutal, selfish and scheming priests rob them regularly of every comfort of life, stripping them down to bare floors, the coarsest foods, and on the walls a few religious gewgaws that cost the people fifty times what they are worth, and are neither truthful, artistic, convincing nor comforting. Poor things!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Into these comfortless homes from which the priests, by one wretched device after another, have taken every cent that can be wrung, to provide them with extravagant religious edifices, palatial homes, limousines, wines, travel, and huge additional sums for gambling on the stock market and investing in tax-free real estate, have come Judge Rutherford's radio addresses, borne on the wings of the wind, without money and without price, as a blessed boon from heaven. Not infrequently some good Catholic soul refers to him in such a way as to clearly reveal the fact that she regards him as a brother beloved in the Lord, whom in her spiritual weakness, and sickness, and poverty, he has visited with the one message of peace and hope and truth that has ever come to her undistorted.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Enough to Make the Angels Weep</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It is enough to make the angels weep to think that men should take away from their fellow pilgrims through this vale of tears the one comfort that they have. Only the Devil, and those that have the spirit of the Devil, would be willing to do it. In selecting the priests of the Roman Catholic church to direct his dirty work in the earth, the Devil has chosen the fittest of all instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wherever they have had a free hand, as in Spain and Mexico, the priests of the Roman Catholic church have shown that they are the world’s champions as liars and as conspirators against common honesty. There is no depth of littleness of soul to which they will not descend in order to further the interests of the most crooked, most devilish system that ever disgraced this planet, by which we mean the Devil's own masterpiece, his “church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We know how the people feel. Does anybody suppose that more than 140,000,000 copies of Judge Rutherford’s books could have been placed in the hands of the people without the people's being friendly to them? Why, over 80,000,000 of these were placed in the United States alone, and that is more than two books to every family in the United States; much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now notice that the institution that has set about to force Judge Rutherford off the air has only 20,000,000 members in this country. In other words, fifteen percent of the people in this land have the unmitigated gall to say to the other eighty-five percent, ‘You shall not have any truth, you shall not have any comfort; you shall have only the papal slop that was fed to Spain and Mexico until it made them so deathly</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sick that they vomited it all up and now refuse to have it at all.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ecuador, a nominally Roman Catholic country, is so sick of the Roman Catholic religion that it is actually against the law for any Roman Catholic priest to enter the country. If they had been a blessing, or if, indeed, they had ever been anything but a curse to the country, do you suppose for a minute that such a law could have been passed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When it comes to lying innuendo, and to veiled and open threats of loss of business or loss of employment, there is no institution ever formed by the Devil, and certainly none ever formed by man, that could do or would do the things that the Roman Catholic institution will do to gain her end. Lying is admittedly all right, but murder is all right, too. As Cardinal O'Connell admitted at the Eucharistic show in Dublin, ‘anything at all is all right’ for Roman Catholics in the United States, ‘as long as they can get away with it.’ Just now they are trying to get away with the job of putting Judge Rutherford off the air.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>The Mendacious, Hypocritical Catholic Press</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Nobody who knows anything about the machinations of the Roman Catholic system would need to be told that their church papers, edited by priests, are anything more than a tissue of lies from end to end. One would expect that. But it is incredible the depths of meanness and smallness to which the editors of such papers descend. The editorials of the twenty-one Catholic papers surveyed are all much alike. We give a sample taken from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Neivs </span><span class="font6">(New York) of August 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In reprinting this editorial we have put in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">italics</span><span class="font6"> the lies or unsupported distortions which run all through it, and have put in CAPITALS the two statements of fact around which this whole great network of lies is woven. Judge Rutherford tells the truth about hell and purgatory; that is objectionable to the spokesmen for the Catholic fifteen percent of the population (though not to many of the individual Catholics themselves), and so:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">RUTHERFORD INSULTS AGAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Apparently the management of Station WMCA has forgotten the promise made to a representative of The Catholic News on July 11, that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Judge’</span><span class="font5"> Rutherford and the Watchtower Service of Brooklyn would not be permitted to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">assail the Catholic Church</span><span class="font5"> in their electrical transcriptions broadcast every Sunday over that station. For some time Rutherford’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(inti-Catholic radio campaigns in other cities, especially in the West,</span><span class="font5"> have been denounced in the Catholic press, and many stations, as a result, have canceled their contracts with him. Here in New York his broadcasts over WMCA did not assume </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a decidedly anti-Catholic tone</span><span class="font5"> until a few months ago. Early in July the station began to receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">protests from Catholics</span><span class="font5"> that the Rutherford talks </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">spoke insultingly of the Pope and Catholic institutions.</span><span class="font5"> When a representative of The Catholic News personally presented the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">grievances of Catholic New Yorkers</span><span class="font5"> on July 11 the station’s director said that in future WMCA would insist in knowing beforehand what each week’s electrical transcription was to say, and he gave assurances that any that contained an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">attack upon the Catholic Church or other religion</span><span class="font5"> would not be broadcast. ‘We will not tolerate over this public station,’ said the manager, ‘an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">insult to any religion, Protestant, Catholic or Jewish.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“For a few Sundays this promise was kept.</span><span class="font5"> But last Sunday morning’s Rutherford broadcast over WMCA </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">was decidedly anti-Catholic.</span><span class="font5"> Its title was ‘SINNERS IN PURGATORY’ and its whole tenor was to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ridicule the Catholic belief</span><span class="font5"> in a middle state after death. Rutherford after quoting Cardinal Gibbons’ reasonable explanation of prayers for the dead in ‘The Faith of Our Fathers’ proceeded </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">outrageously to distort the meaning</span><span class="font5"> of what the late Cardinal wrote. The doctrine of purgatory, Rutherford said, was designed to induce people to contribute money to the clergy to pray for the dead. The doctrine, he said, was as false as Satan himself. He quoted, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in his peculiarly jumbled fashion,</span><span class="font5"> many bits of Scripture to back up his assertion there was nothing in the Bible that authorizes prayers for the dead, but, of course, he omitted the one well-known to Catholics: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘It is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from their sins.’ <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There was much more in last Sunday’s Rutherford broadcast </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">insulting to Catholics.</span><span class="font5"> Evidently WMCA’s management </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">senses the offensiveness of what Rutherford has to say,</span><span class="font5"> for before and after each broadcast the announcer solemnly declares that ‘the opinions expressed are peculiarly Judge Rutherford’s and should not be accepted as the editorial expression of Station WMCA.’ That disclaimer does not absolve the station for responsibility for what Rutherford says. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He is and always has been assailing all religion </span><span class="font5">that is not fashioned on his own peculiar lines. The preceding Sunday, in a talk on ‘IS HELL HOT?’ he declared that ‘the hell fire doctrine taught by the clergy is driving millions out of the churches.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Rutherford, as every one who listens to him soon discovers, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">has strange religious notions.</span><span class="font5"> He is entitled to expound these ideas to his heart's content, even over the radio, we will concede. But he has no right to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">misrepresent and attack the teachings of Protestant, Catholic or Jewish bodies</span><span class="font5"> in order to get over his philosophy, and no radio station with a sense of decency and fair play would permit him in such a manner </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">to insult multitudes of their listcners-in.</span><span class="font5"> Speakers on religious topics are to be heard on all the reputable radio stations. But no one can truthfully say that Dr. Cadman, Dr. Fosdick, Dr. Poling, Dr. Reisner or any other eminent Protestant clergyman ever </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">assails the cherished beliefs of Catholics or Jews,</span><span class="font5"> or that the speakers on the ‘Catholic Hour’ speak disparagingly of their Protestant brethren. It remains for a Rutherford to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">violate the canons of gentlemanly conduct on the air,</span><span class="font5"> and the station that permits him to do so is guilty of as grave an infraction as himself. In view of the fact that WMCA seems bent upon permitting Rutherford to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">insult the Catholics of New York</span><span class="font5"> every Sunday the Catholic people ought to make it their business to let the management of the station know how they feel toward WMCA.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Twenty-five Lies and Two Truths</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing editorial contains twenty-five lies and two truths. Everything in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">italics</span><span class="font6"> has the full force and effect of a lie. It takes time and space to answer lies, and we are short of both; but by glancing over the article the lies can be at once located. Why bother to deny them or to answer them ? What answer that will convince him can be made to a liar? Even while the answer is being made he frames yet other lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two truths are that Judge Rutherford lectured on “Sinners in Purgatory” and “Is Hell Hot?” lie had a perfect right to lecture on these subjects, and there are millions who wish to hear them discussed and are interested also to read what this Bible scholar has to say. If there are untold millions of the human family in either or both of these places, is it not important to know of their condition ? And if the priests and other clergy have deceived the people on these subjects, as they have on everything else, do the people not have a right to look into the matter ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real fact of the business is that the people are listening, and reading and thinking, and that is something that the clergy are desperately determined must not occur. They will do all the thinking that is done, the same as they did in Mexico and Spain and Ecuador, and everybody else must keep silent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If here and there a radio manager has some integrity and tries to see that Judge Rutherford's friends get a fair deal, the first thing he knows the pressure is exerted on him from a new angle. Advertisers over his station are warned that their goods will be boycotted unless they desist from broadcasting over the same stations as Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In St. Louis, W. L. Mittendorf, a faithful postal employee, as a result of pressure brought by D. J. Casey, business manager of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Watchman,</span><span class="font6"> Roman Catholic paper of that city, was told in so many words by the postmaster that he would either have to give up his connections with the Watch Tower organization or else lose his job in the postal service. He went on to say that Mr. Farley, the postmaster general, is a Roman Catholic, and that unless Mr. Mittendorf came to some agreement with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Sunday Watchman</span><span class="font6"> it would mean his job.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>That Is Just Plain Murder</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Now all that that means is that the Roman Catholic organization is an organization of murderers, within the plain teaching of Jesus himself, in Matthew 5: 21, 22; for nobody but a murderer would insist that a man must discontinue his service of Jehovah God or they would deprive his family of a livelihood. There is not another institution on this planet that would make a threat like that, or carry out a threat like that, than the Roman Catholic church. But </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font6"> would do it and gloat over it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real reason why these liars and murderers are after Judge Rutherford is that he has for years pleaded with the big religionists to publicly debate over the radio whether they serve Jehovah God, as they claim, or whether, in fact, they are really part and parcel of the Devil’s organization. Judge Rutherford has offered to defray half the expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his letter to the Roman Catholic press, Judge Rutherford says some things that ought to strike home to any true Catholic, and will appeal to many of them. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Why should the people be denied the opportunity of learning what God’s Word teaches, merely because those divine truths when uttered ‘offend the sensibilities’ of certain men who are not in harmony with God? I agree that one man has no right to attack another’ man personally; but when any man brings forth a doctrine relating to God’s dealing with the human race and asks the people to believe that doctrine, then it is the right and duty of others who do not agree to call attention to the fact that such doctrines promulgated do not proceed from God but proceed from God’s enemy the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I have nothing against Catholics as men or women, I only take issue with the doctrines which that organization teaches. If the Catholic clergy want to be fair, why don't they accept my proposition to publicly discuss these questions or doctrines and then let the people determine for themselves which is truth? The gag and bludgeon method can never make any of the people free, but, in the language of Jesus, ‘the truth shall make you free.’ (John 8: 32) You claim to speak for millions of Catholics; but I tell you that you do not speak for them. There are millions of good people in the Catholic organization who do not believe what you say. Why not let them all have an opportunity to hear both sides of the question discussed and then let them speak for themselves? You are not their guardians except by self-appointment.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE pope made eight charges against the Spanish Republic. They are said to be serious enough that if Ambrose had the nerve to do it he would excommunicate the whole works, but, if he did that, collections would fall off to less than they now are, and they are now small enough. One of the eight ‘sins’ committed by the Spanish is that they have separated church and state. Perhaps they have been influenced by Spanish-speaking persons in other lands. Take Mexico, for example. Vera Cruz will permit but one priest to hold up 100,000 people. In Yucatan they permit nine priests to collect from 400,000. In Mexico city twenty-five priests have to get all the money that is obtained from 1,250,000 people. The papal delegate to Mexico was expelled as a pernicious foreigner. Ecuador has a law that no foreign clergyman may enter the country. Maybe the Spanish people have heard of these things. Or then again, maybe the things they have done are based upon their own experience and express their honest conviction of what is best for them as a people. Scolding them will change nothing.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>How Was This Miracle Performed?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font6">ITS issue of June 22, 1933, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register,</span><span class="font6"> of Kansas City, said feelingly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘The Holy Year,’ the subject of his next talk, is to be the three-ring circus. This same speech, when broadcast on April 23 from a limited number of stations, caused a storm of protest wherever it was heard. It resulted in the Canadian government barring Rutherford from the air and in numerous broadcasting stations in this country dropping his speeches from their schedules.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It so happens that the telegram which Hector Charlesworth sent out to Canadian radio stations ordering Judge Rutherford’s lectures off the air was sent, not on April 24, as one would judge from the foregoing “information”, but on the previous January 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now is that not interesting? According to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register,</span><span class="font6"> the renowned Charlesworth, whose only claim to being a Catholic is that he married a Catholic wife, has the gift of prophecy. Foreseeing that, ninety-seven days later, Judge Rutherford would let the gas out of the pope’s “Holy Year” balloon, he was so moved that he straightway shut him off the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a consequence of his being shut off the air in Canada, the people were so incensed at his “Holy Year” speech, which they were thus deprived of hearing, that they had Charlesworth wire ninety-seven days ahead of time that nothing like that which he had arranged should not be done should not be done some more!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This true Roman Catholic logic fits nicely into the arrangement by which, for a consideration, a priest will use his influence with “the grandmother of God” to pass that influence on to “the mother of God”, who in turn will beg God himself to do the right thing by the poor sinner Christ came to save, but which sinner He is so mad at that He will keep him frying, baking and roasting in torment for hundreds of years—unless his relatives are forehanded and generous with the long green in his behalf, by buying masses and other things which the “church” has for sale.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend Doctor Samuel Trexler, in an address opening the United Lutheran Synod </span><span class="font6">of New York, at Buffalo, described the Lutheran church as follows, and it sounds as if he must have been out in the witness work:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> ‘ The greatest fault of the church is her worldliness. She adopts her patterns from the passing things about her. Thus the progress of the church is too parallel to the progress of the world. When the world is on the height the church is there too; when the world is in the valleys the church is there too. It would be well if the church were there to minister, but she is there more frequently as a beggar. Where is the spirit of the martyr, the crusader, the reformer, the pioneer? Everywhere man is today gripped with the spirit of fear, which is not the spirit of God. The church does not stand as a positive conviction like a rock among shifting sands. She does not express to the world power and love and a sound mind, but ranks rather as a galvanic battery whose force is run down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps one reason why Reverend Trexler is depressed over the condition of the Lutheran church is that, so it seems from his report, some of the brethren have collected a fund for missionary purposes but have hung on to it and used it for themselves. On this point he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘It is fundamentally wrong to use funds gathered for others on ourselves. How can we expect God to prosper our work in the face of such malfeasance?”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Margaret Sanger Gives Mental Aid to the Pope</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">argaret Sanger has made a study of the whole difficult subject of birth control, and writes on it intelligently and convincingly. In an article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font6"> entitled “My Answer to the Pope on Birth Control”, she says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pope has no respect for the mental powers of the individual. He writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wherefore, let the faithful also be on their guard against the overrated independence of private judgment and that false autonomy of human reason. For it is quite foreign to everyone bearing the name of Christian to trust his own mental powers with such pride as to agree only with those things which he can examine from tlieir inner nature ... a characteristic of all true followers of Christ, lettered and unlettered, is to suffer themselves to be guided and led in all things that touch upon faith or morals of the holy Church of God, through its supreme pastor, the Roman pontiff, who is himself guided by Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is what the pope says. Now let us see what Jesus says. Saint Matthew quotes Him thus: “Have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?” Saint Mark quotes the same statement. But did Jesus say that every wife had to bear children as fast as they would come? Did He ever advocate rearing large families as a duty toward God ? Did He ever say anything against the limitation of offspring? Did He ever say anything that by any twist of argument can be interpreted to mean that He disapproved of contraception? If He did, why does not the pope cite chapter and verse ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having answered, point by point, those parts of the pope’s encyclical which refer to birth control, I want to add that his attitude in general seems to be conditioned by a disapproval of human enjoyment and an apparent relishing of the theory that suffering is good for our souls. He speaks of himself as “looking with paternal eye ... as from a watch-tower.” It is a tower set in splendor, surrounded by walls that shut out the world of broken homes, of sick and sorrowladen mothers, poverty-stricken fathers, and pathetic, unwanted children. In that remote tower he sits comfortably, takes counsel from a pile of old books and from bachelor advisers, and then writes scolding sermons about the marriage problems of intelligent people. I wish he could come down into real life for a few weeks, walk the earth and mingle with the poor “ye have always with you.” He would hear true stories from Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish women which I should think would be enough to shake sense into the head of any man.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Making the People Healthy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS a great responsibility, this of making the people healthy. It takes a great mind to comprehend how filling the human blood stream with pus is really a good thing. In England and Wales only 88 children under five years of age died of smallpox in the 24 years ending December, 1928, but 232 died of vaccination. That shows the difficulties in the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of us can remember back to 1890, when the world was thrilled with the news that Doctor Robert Koch, of Germany, had discovered a cure for tuberculosis. He repudiated that cure, tuberculin, because the facts made it necessary, hut the ones that made the serum made a new market for it by the grafting of it into cattle. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Grafting</span><span class="font6"> is the right word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When tuberculin is injected into cattle, the cattle are made sick, the milk becomes ropey and stringy and its flow is diminished, the calves born are defective; sometimes the cattle die. In 1932 tuberculin was injected into all Indian children in Montana; the consent of their parents was not asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The necessity for vaccination may be judged from the following quotations from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth Teller:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1926, Oklahoma reported 868 eases of smallpox without a single death. West Virginia had 387 cases, New York 305, North Dakota 276, all without a single death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1927 Michigan reported 1,469 cases of smallpox, Idaho 759, Montana 575, New York 376, North Dakota 208, all without a single death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1928, Nebraska reported 1,472 cases of smallpox, Arkansas 241, Connecticut 170, Wyoming 163, Minnesota 130, all without a single death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1929, Wisconsin reported 758 cases of smallpox, Alabama 378, Minnesota 321, New York 291, Vermont 216, Arkansas 213, all without a single death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During these same years many states reported but one death from smallpox, with many hundreds of cases, during a single year. Ohio reported 2,133, Texas 1,898, Washington 1,772, Georgia 957, Virginia 596, Mississippi 639, Nebraska 691, Idaho 611, Utah 586, and Montana 547.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Quite a large number of states reported over 1,000 cases of smallpox with but two deaths in a single year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few years ago the Russell Sage Foundation issued a nation-wide report showing the average distance from homes to doctors, and the public health statistics for<sup>1</sup> the same year showed that the districts where the homes averaged the greatest distance from doctors were the healthiest districts in the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Sun-Bathing </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster (Calif.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font6">UN-BATHING is one of the forms of bathing most conducive to health and longevity; but it, as well as many other good things, can be done incorrectly and overdone and so the benefits be lost. Remember, the skin must become used to the rays of the sun gradually. It is best to expose the body but a few minutes at a time, at first two and one-half minutes to a side, making ten minutes in all the first day, then gradually building up to one-half hour, or to an hour in some cases. This is best done by increasing the exposure five minutes each day. Blondes can stand less exposure than brunettes; nervous types, less exposure than phlegmatic types of people. In all types the head and eyes and back of the neck should always be well protected from the rays of the sun, to prevent sunstroke. If you are dizzy during the sun bath it is a sign you need to shorten your exposure, or if your body feels fatigued after the bath it indicates the same. Follow the sun bath with a tepid sponge and a period of rest; then by a cool or cold shower </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font6"> the rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The proper time for sun-bathing is in the early morning. It is then that we get more </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">light </span><span class="font6">and less </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">heat,</span><span class="font6"> and it gives a more beneficial effect than an overexposure to the infra-red rays of the sun, which are in many cases too heating and stimulating. The earlier in the forenoon you take the sun bath, the greater will be the beneficial effect, because you get more of the ultra-violet rays, which are healing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do not take the sun bath too close to meal time, especially not </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font6"> a full meal, as the rays of the sun draw the blood away from the internal organs to the surface of the body and interfere with digestion. During the summer months, when we are getting more sun, we need to make our diet much lighter, consisting principally of fruit and vegetables and some dairy products. Limit starches and sweets and heavy proteins (meats, etc.) at this time; also fats and seasoning and condiments. The sun is germicidal and antiseptic in effect; it kills bacteria, overcomes toxemia, aids respiration and assimilation and elimination, strengthens vital functions, is energizing. The sun stimulates the natural agents that nourish the nervous system. It stimulates the growth and development of the red blood corpuscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Danger from Excessive Sun-Bathing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">From Polish Golden Age</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">T THE Paris Medical Conference Dr. Mathieu De Fossey explained the results of his study and actual experimentation made on ten patients, that excessive sun-bathing is very dangerous. It is quite evident that excessive sun-bathing, nowadays so fashionable, is very harmful to the health. In the first instance, it acts on the liver, causing it to be overflowed with blood, thereby making room for subsequent ailments and later anaphylaxis. The doctor claimed later in his lecture that artificial silk allows the ultra-violet rays to penetrate.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The Tuberculin Cattle Testing Job</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font6">ROM all we can learn of its operation the tuberculin testing of cattle merely provides work for veterinaries. So far as benefiting the farmer or the taxpayer, the thing is a total loss. One farmer told us he lost his entire herd, and he felt sure there was no reason for it. Another told us that he lost his best cattle but was allowed to keep the poorest ones. Another followed his cattle to the butcher shop at Pittston and found that none of the cattle condemned as tuberculous were so at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A woman writes in from New Hampshire that against her protest, and without a warrant, six men entered her premises, where they shot tuberculin into a young bull, three heifers, one twelve-year-old milch cow and a two-month-old calf. These animals were used only for the food supply of the family and had belonged to the family for four animal generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The lady, who seems to be a true American, does not relish the way things are going in this country at present. She says in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The second time they came I had my barn doors padlocked. I did this on the advice of Mayor Charles E. Carroll, of Laconia, and the county solicitor, Theo. Jewett. They both said the “vets” would not dare to break in without a court order. Of course, we knew they had no court order, as I had never been haled into court on the ease, and that meant a jury trial, which I had never had. In fact, I had never had any charge preferred against me, and the state officials are entirely lawless, including the assistant attorney general, Thornton Lorimer, who ordered them here the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have resisted the test in a lawful manner by refusing to give my consent to have my cattle injected with tuberculin. Needless to say, my confidence in government has been destroyed, inasmuch as public officials of the state of New Hampshire have violated the fundamental law of the land, namely, the constitution of the United States and the state constitution, when they came to my home without due process of law and forcibly injected my cattle with filth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was brought up to respect law, and by that I mean I was taught to believe that I had certain Godgiven, inalienable rights that must be respected by officials and other citizens as well as my duty to obey those laws. I was taught that nowhere in all the world was the individual’s rights so respected and protected as in these United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now I have this to say, that there has arisen in our midst a sinister thing, namely State Medicine, a thing more terrible than Roman Papacy ever was: Medical Popery! And if this fiendish thing is not put down, we shall be a nation of rotten flesh and gibbering idiots. Public health! What hypocrisy! It reminds me of the Spanish Inquisition, where the Roman church said in devilish glee, “No blood was shed!” Public health today includes putting filthy serums and vaccines, made from inoculating poor helpless animals with horrible diseases and torturing them uselessly, not to improve the health of humanity, God knows, but to enrich the human devils who attempt to force their horrible concoctions upon the helpless children of this and other countries, as well as upon our animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is self-evident that sanitation and hygiene are responsible for better health as well as the higher standards of living enjoyed previously through the advance of material prosperity. It is also self-evident that the Medical Trust was alarmed at the loss of business to themselves as the health of the nation advanced and they must do something to keep alive disease and therefore keep alive their profession of “ministering to the sick” ! But first there must be sick people. How could they be sure there would be sick people and business for themselves? By inoculating disease into the nucleus population, the children. Also anyone else they can ensnare. When a profession becomes commercialized, such as the healing of the sick, it becomes, not an act of mercy, but a grinning archdevil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I read in one issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> an article about the necessity for search warrants in the seizure of liquor under the prohibition law. Now, if it was necessary then, certainly it was necessary for the state “vet” to go to the trouble of causing a charge to be preferred before he could have legally injected my cattle. You understand, I am not in business, and was bootlegging no milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the main reasons why prohibition was so unpopular was the fact of lawless procedure as well as the violation of the individual’s personal rights to eat or drink to suit himself. As I understand it, the American Bar Association helped to arouse sentiment against it because of the lawlessness it engendered in the so-called “law enforcement” officers. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are alarmed because our home is not safe from these periodical raids and if we do not do something immediately the “vet” will return and further inject my cattle with tuberculin. Have I no rights at all? They inject them every six months. It is a deliberate attack on a private home. We are outraged. Why should we be forced to submit to this diseasing of our cattle? We depend on these animals for our food supply. Why should we have to have our food supply poisoned at the source? We have lived here twenty-five years. I was told by the State Attendance man if I did not like the laws of New Hampshire I could move out. I told him I had not heard of New Hampshire’s seceding from the Union, and I was an American citizen, not just a citizen of New Hampshire, and if he did not like that he could go [South], And as far as I know we are both still in New Hampshire and likely to meet in court any day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Negation </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Edward C. Leigh (Missouri)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is a sevenfold process running all through creation. For instance, scientists, with no idea of this, worked out (1) light, (2) heat, (3) sound, (4) motion, (5) weight or gravity, (6) chemical activity, and (7) electricity. Each one of these has seven degrees or rates of vibration. Six circular objects of the same size, with a seventh in the center, make a ‘wheel within a wheel’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are seven prime colors: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red; there are seven notes in the musical scale: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si. The invisible tilings of God are made understandable by the creative processes. Light corresponds to truth; darkness, to error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cold is no positive, but a negative of heat, its absence; as silence is of sound and darkness of light, and as the primeval dust is of attraction or cohesion. Then, by the same token, evil is no necessary law of creation, but is the absence of good, as death is of life, and when the Great Negation is snuffed out, all evils, all negatives, will be snuffed out with their father or originator and there will be a spotless universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heat is a positive; cold, an absence of heat. Stick an iron rod into the fire. When hot plunge one end into water; the heat will travel along the rod and you cannot hold it; cold, the negative, is dead; it does not travel. It will slowly communicate, but does not travel as heat travels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Presumably life is vibration, the right kind of vibration. Sin, evil, is wrong vibration, declining vibration. Where Paul says “the motions of sin” we would say “the vibrations of sin”. A motion, a shake, a vibration, are all the same. Isaiah says, in the thirtieth chapter, “In battles of shaking&quot; (vibrations) will God contend with Satan. The wave offering was a vibratory movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The physical forces are all wave motions, frequencies. Thought is a vibration, and life too, I suppose. Death is deadness, stillness, silence, motionless. The whale, monster in the sea, is likened to Satan. Whalers have observed that the leader of the herd, scattered over five to ten miles square, seems to vibrate sailing, cruising directions to all in a few moments. Certainly Satan must have some similar process for directing his war on truth. God’s invisible things are illustrated by the works of creation everywhere. Satan’s first lie was a great </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">negation</span><span class="font6"> of good.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>And That Is Not the Half of It</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">everend Doctor George Lang paid his compliments to his fellow Presbyterians in the following address to the Presbyterian synod of Alabama:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the midst of a society shot through with racketeering, and its “front” of hypocrisy and skepticism in polities, business and industry, we have remained silent with the silence of unfeeling moral indifference, with silences of doubt, and have had no outraged consciences because we have stubbornly refused to have our consciences exposed to the evils which abound about us. . . . Only the blind could fail to see that our civilization was a cheap superstructure sustained by no secure foundations in character, no high purposes, and dedicated to no high ends. ... To look back on our witness in this decadent society is to sec ourselves in sorry cowardice, ineffective, and without real influence. It is not to be wondered at that we stand today discredited in moral and spiritual leadership. We did unworthy deference to men who were, and are, inferiors both intellectually and morally. . . . We have cheapened our ministry, we have made it common; we have reduced it to the level of pose and palaver; so that even in our human relations we are insincere and unreal . . . surely we will no longer apologize for our ministry of mind, or heart, or will, to a perverse generation whose most characteristic marks are superficiality, gaudiness, vulgarity, insincerity, bad manners, moronic thought, and “wisecracking” platitudes. . . . How many of our elders or deacons read anything more penetrating than the familiar columnist of bright and snappy sayings ? . . . It is particularly offensive that these “outstanding men” who sense little that is splendid in communication or appreciation are elected even to the offices of the church, where social promotion is easier than in any other group. . . . Look at what only you may see: the ruins of a civilization; its poverty and its heartless cruelty. . . . We have little to hope for from our laymen. . . . Their loftiest spiritual level is a cautious morality whose achievement is respectability; and their highest intellectual attainment is some outmoded conceit. In the debacle of their civilization they have shown neither imagination nor courage. They have lost their heads; they are afraid and cowardly. It is the institutions they have erected which need a moral house-cleaning; all of them, without exception.</span></p>

By attacking or by punitive treatment, the powers of the world must be broken down in order to fulfil the Divine Mission of Japan.

<p><span class="font6">The Manchurian Refugees’ Relief Association, Shanghai, China, declares that Japanese troops have an apparatus for pulling heads out a foot before decapitation; that they have an apparatus for automatically cutting victims into pieces; that they burn victims alive by binding them with cotton saturated with oil; that they have trained dogs to bite victims to death; that they bury victims alive, and that they bump two victims together until both are slain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Photographs of the crude but efficient guillotines are unquestionably genuine. They resemble old-style hand-operated contrivances used in butcher shops for slicing purposes. In one of the pictures three headless bodies are shown; the heads themselves are on the other side of the guillotine and are also visible. The face of the executioner is the face of a devil. Two officers hold the victim and stretch his neck over the block while a third does the slicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Fushun, Manchuria, because Chinese soldiers had marched through the place, when the Japanese came to it they gathered three thousand men, women and children on a hilltop, promising them food. They were requested to stand quiet while their pictures w<sup>r</sup>ere taken. A machine gun was set up and they were mowed down to the last one.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font6">NOTICED an article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> of <span class="font6">December 9, 1931, regarding the divining rod. I have had a fair bit of experience watching those who use the rod, and I have not seen one use it who loved the Creator. Also, I have seen the rod work, and have seen people made fools of repeatedly. The diviners have stated water could be got at certain depths, and often double the distance has been bored and no water obtained, even after the stick or twig snapped from the invisible power or pressure on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If it were a God-given power it would not affect the health of the people. This practice of divining has the same influence over persons who continue the practice as seances have on people. They get sleepy and dreamy and lose the clear luster of the eye; they get a queer look instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had a man call on us a while ago who divines for water for a living. He walked around our block for an hour or so and then said he would lie down for a while, as he always felt ill after doing that work. He was a man only in his forties, but looked over seventy years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another thing. If electricity had to do with the stick, and the finding of water, who puts the knowledge in the brain to say at what depth the water will be found? Surely not God, for He has not been ruling the world. When His kingdom is established He will send the rain in its season, and men will not be walking about with little twigs speculating on the unseen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, all that I have seen using the rod, if perchance they get water, take all the credit to their clever knowledge and superior powers. I think the demons are at the bottom of it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>One-Sixth of the World’s Surface</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HIS account of Soviet Russia, by Russell Wright, is that of a friendly critic, looking for a better day for mankind, and willing to give full credit for what has been accomplished by American engineers in transforming a nation of peasants into a self-contained industrial and agricultural economy. We note some of the points made in his interesting book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the Russian population of 102,000,000, less than 3,000,000 are members of the Communist party, but these 3,000,000 are determined that all of Russia shall be educated in what is necessary to make a good citizen. In the days of the czar, in the year 1912, there were only 34,630 books published in all of Russia; in one year recently the output was 242,000,000; in the same year the output in America was 50,000,000. Russia wants to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every young man must serve in the Red Army, and before he may have permission to return home he must know how to read and write. People may get intoxicated if they wish, but only bottled liquors are sold, and the drinking must be done at home. No attention is paid to days of the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Drunkards, thieves and lazy persons are held up to public obloquy. On the walls of the factories they are cartooned by name, and in some factories they are required to receive their pay at special windows, where they are objects of ridicule. Electric power, at Dneprostroy, the world’s largest hydroelectric station, is produced at one-eighth of lc per kilowatt hour. Suppose you compare this with what you have to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The traveler will find tipping uncommon, whereas in other countries of Europe there is an endeavor to clean his pockets of money. Soldiers often assist the workers on their off-day. The wages of workers range all the way from eighty rubles ($40) per month for farm hands to four hundred rubles ($200) for good mechanics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The standard rent charged to workers is 10 percent of their wage. At the Verbliud state farm, farm hands and mechanics are allowed free rent, light, heat, furniture and working clothing in addition to their wage; if they choose, they can get three meals of good food each day in the communal kitchen for seventy kopecks (35c). There is no unemployment. Everyone who wishes to eat is expected to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The seven-hour day is universal; there is one full day of rest in every five; each worker has two weeks vacation per year, with full pay; if his work is liable to be injurious to the health, as in mining or chemical plants, the annual vacation is a full month. All over Russia there are rest homes, sanitariums, where workers can go when they need a rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In no case may a minor under fourteen be employed; minors between the ages of fourteen and sixteen may work not more than four hours per day. Women receive equal pay for equal work. Expectant mothers are given eight weeks’ leave of absence, with full pay, both before and after confinement, with medical assistance; after they return to work they are allowed pay for the time spent in nursing their little ones in the nurseries attached to every factory. Marriages and divorces are $1 each, and one is as simple as the other, generally speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A worker who thinks he has been unjustly dismissed from his job has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, the highest court of the nation. Prisoners are granted vacations, of three days, seven days, or one month, per year, depending on their record. They are paid wages, which are saved for them until the day of release ; every prisoner is allowed to go anywhere in the prison he may wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any stranger entering a Russian city will be entertained for one night in a Peasant’s Home, of which there are 1,500 in Russia. Such homes, and all restaurants, factories and public buildings, contain lecture rooms where an intensive educational work is constantly under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Russia there is unemployment relief, permanent disability relief, old age pensions, medical assistance, temporary assistance in case of sickness, and many other things space does not permit to mention. Mr. Wright has written an interesting book, and manifestly truthful.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“They can control in any of these corporations the raising or lowering of wages; they can change the conditions of labor; they can raise or lower the price of the output of any manufacturing establishment, simply because they control the money of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The railroad officials are only their servants. The presidents and officers of these various manufacturing corporations are compelled, whether they like it or not, to obey the mandate that comes from Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“J. P. Morgan, with the assistance and cooperation of a few of the interlocking corporations which reach all over the nation in their influence, controls every railroad of the United States. They control practically every public utility; they control all the large insurance companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Why do they want to mix in the insurance business? In the real insuring of people they have no interest. They want the money. They want to be the depositories of the large funds, the enormous funds, the billions of dollars which are necessary in the operation of these great insurance companies.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Ethics</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">E ASK you, 0 gentle reader, to say who should be foremost in paying taxes in these United Sates? Should it be the one who has everything in the country in his possession, and thus has most to lose when the whole thing goes down kersmash ? Or should he content himself with the thought that it is enough for him to own everything, and that it is the plain duty of the common people to be honest and patriotic and pay their taxes and let him alone in the full enjoyment of that which he has gotten?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Newspapers shriek that J. P. Morgan paid no income taxes for the last three years. They do not say that he hires the best lawyers and certified public accountants available; they don’t need to; everybody knows that he does; and if you don’t know what lawyers and accountants are for, and the kind of work they do for hire, then you are unsophisticated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a recent address in the United States Senate, Senator Norris said some things that give room for thought to those who now learn that J. P. Morgan and Captain Kidd have ceased paying income taxes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. . . “if the government of the United States wanted to take over the railroads, they would have to see</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Morgan, King of the Bolshevik!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">D</span><span class="font6">ENOUNCING J. P. Morgan as the king of all Bolsheviks, Senator M. M. Neely castigated the world’s most powerful financial monarch as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While Morgan was escaping the payment of an income tax, more than 140,000 American farmers had the last acre of their land sold from under their feet in satisfaction of taxes they were too poor to pay. During the same period thousands of jobless working men had the roofs sold from over their heads to satisfy their taxes. But Morgan, the mightiest of millionaires, with his palatial English manor house, his mansions in New York and on Long Island, his shooting lodge in Scotland, his luxurious sea-going yacht that cost millions, his innumerable priceless treasures of art collected from all corners of the earth, with all of his luxury, power and pelf, was not moved by heartbreaking tragedies in the lives of the nation’s distressed to contribute a farthing to the support of the Federal government, and thereby relieve the unfortunate of a part of their burdens. ’ ’</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">program for the drafting of soldiers. The ones that have most at stake are the big financiers; so in the front ranks he would put such men as J. P. Morgan, Andrew Mellon, Henry Ford, John J. Raskob, William Woodin, William G. McAdoo and all the other members of the National Economy League. The troops would all go to the front, men and women, in the order of their fortunes. Those that have nothing, and therefore have nothing to lose, would not have to go at all. Seems like a good plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Too Many Governments</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">NCLUDING the national government, the state, county, city, township and school district governments, it is calculated that there are in the United States somewhere between a quarter million and a half million governments. It is now coming to be appreciated that these are too many to function efficiently, and the expense is too great to be borne. It will be interesting to many to know that New<sup>7</sup> York city spends more on her police than the revenue of thirty-five states, and that the cities of Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis spend more for garbage removal than the entire expenses of the state of Nevada.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>What America Got Out of the World War</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">By Huey P. Long (La.) in a speech in the United States Senate</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">WAS not in favor of the war with Germany. I am not in favor of it now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They sent the soldiers with the brass bands playing and with the flags flying, promising them that when the camp fires had died down and they had returned home they were going to kill the fatted calf, that they were going to get the robe and put it on the back of the son returning home, and that the greatness of the land would be theirs eternally if ever they had the misfortune to suffer the slightest disability in the cause of serving democracy and humanity and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I did not go to that war, Mr. President. I was within the draft age. I could have gone, except for my dependents. I did not go because I did not want to go, even aside from that fact. That question was asked on the floor of the Senate. I did not go because I was not mad at anybody over there, for another reason. I did not go because it was not the first time in history that the sons of America had volunteered themselves as cannon fodder under the misguided apprehension that it was going to be a fight for humanity, when they were used in that war and in the years following, and are used today and will be in the years to follow, for the purpose of centralizing the wealth of the United States and of the world in the hands of the few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How well did we come out of it? We went into the war with 2 percent of the people owning 60 percent of the wealth. We came out of the war with 1 percent of the people owning 60 percent of the wealth. We came out of that war and into this war with 5 percent of the people owning 85 percent of the wealth. We have come out of that war with dictatorships flowering in Italy, with dictatorships flowering in Germany, with dictatorships flowering all over the countries that we crossed 4,000 miles to “make them safe for democracy”. We have come out, Mr. President, not with having made them democracies, but, instead, to make America safe for dictatorship. They have crossed from the East to the West and made America safe for dictatorship, whereas we thought we had crossed from the West to the East to make Europe safe for democracy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Kellogg Peace Pact in Manchuria</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">E</span><span class="font6">VER hear about the Kellogg Peace Pact?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It originated in America; it declares that war is a crime. Ever hear about the Nine-Power Treaty? It safeguards the situation in the Pacific, ensuring that nobody will resort to war, and that everybody will take good care of China. Ever hear about the Covenant of the League of Nations? Japan and China both became members of the League, and were therefore committed to peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ever hear about America’s firm position that it cannot ever recognize Manchukuo? Well, the recent dispatches from Asia say: “The Japanese column en route to the front in the central part of Jehol from Suichung forms a three-mile-long cavalcade of American-made trucks, which carry thousands of Japanese infantrymen. They have the deadliest of weapons and the very best of supplies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ever hear about the big orders for w’ar supplies that the Vickers Armstrong Company, British concern, secured from both the Japanese and Chinese just a few weeks ago ? The buyers for both countries met in the anteroom and jewed the Vickers people down 40 percent on their prices. As soon as the order was landed, the British at first announced that all orders booked would be filled, but no more orders would be accepted. That is an embargo. Subsequently this embargo was lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Uncle Sam, who did not get in on the big orders, in spite of all those nice new trucks, was mad and refused to go along on the embargo proposition. He feels that the decent thing to do would be to let the Japanese and Chinese buyers come over here and shop around and get all the war supplies they would need for several years and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">then</span><span class="font6"> he would be willing to show that his heart is in the right place by placing an embargo. But he wants the orders first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And when Uncle Sam finally does pronounce an embargo, you can bet that the State Department will explain that the reason why it is done is that war is a crime, and the conditions of the Nine-Power Treaty make it essential that it should take this act of simple honesty and justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Near Death from Buttermilk </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By George Q. Barties (Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;DUTTERMILK is one of the most healthful of foods; that is a known fact. The aluminum companies persist in trying to tell the people that aluminum is a good metal to take into the system; the more you take in, the better you feel. Their repeated protestations that there is nothing harmful about the use of aluminum cooking utensils reminds one of nothing so much as a young lady going down the street loudly vociferating that she is not immoral. She draws attention to herself, but it is not the kind of attention that does her any good. The more she says, the more the people suspect that she knows something she is not telling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On August 2, 1912, in the city of La Grange, Texas, a lady churned, using a new one-gallon glass churn. When she had finished churning both she and her daughter drank of the buttermilk. About an hour later both started vomiting and feeling sick in the stomach. The mother was just able to call another daughter who lived next door. She sent for a doctor right away, but one was not sufficient, so another doctor was called in. Meantime the two women were desperately ill, one calling for a blanket, and the other for a wet towel, alternately. This happened in the afternoon and kept up all night. The new churn was the cause of it. The rod of the dasher had been painted with aluminum paint, which worked off during the churning process and was drunk with the buttermilk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Death in the Aluminum Bucket</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">WENTY-TWO young people of New Orleans, placing implicit confidence in the widely published assertions of the Aluminum Trust, the American Medical Association, the Mellon Institute, and other like institutions, attended a picnic at Little Woods, where they all drank punch from an aluminum bucket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American, The Literary Digest,</span><span class="font6"> and other windbags that never learn anything about anything of real value to the people, they should have been able to drink this punch all right, and according to the Aluminum Trust the metal they swallowed should really have been a help to them all. But the fact of the business is that they were all made deathly sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And doesn’t it seem just too bad that not only will the Government do absolutely nothing about these repeated poisonings, but when someone who knows the facts dares to publish them they actually want to stop the publication of them? At least they did under the administration of the late President Hoover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer’s Breakfast Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By Ada Ralph</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE following method of cooking whole-wheat cereal, ground through a coffee grinder, might interest other “pioneers”. It is quickly prepared, and a convenience for those who have little time to spend in cooking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One heaping cup (coffee cup size) of crushed whole wheat, teaspoonful salt, two cups of boiling water. After stirring a few minutes, leave it to finish cooking on low gas or flame for twenty minutes, or put in double boiler for same time or for thirty minutes. This makes a satisfying breakfast, carries one to supper time, and keeps one in good condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Separation of Oil from Water</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A LLANELLY (Wales) man has invented a device which it is claimed works perfectly, on a gravity principle, in separating oil from water. By the use of this device it is hoped to recover all oils now wasted in sewers and, best of all, to prevent the fouling of harbors and other waters by the waste from oil-burning vessels. This waste, in recent years, has resulted in the death of millions of birds. They becoming enmeshed in films of oil, their plumage becomes water-soaked, and they contract pneumonia and die.</span></p>

We would be interested to know what United States law or what Illinois law gives the right to police officials or anybody else to turn back law-abiding men who are unemployed through no fault of their own and who wish to get their case before their legal representatives. Looks like a bad business.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bernard Shaw' pinned this bouquet on the banking fraternity:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“One reason international conferences don’t succeed is because bankers are allowed to have a hand in them. International bankers are profiting by the world's insolvency and it’s natural they don’t want it to get solvent again. It’s futile to allow these few tremendously wealthy men who know nothing of statesmanship to attempt to cure the world’s ills. Their very profession immediately disqualifies them from holding the confidence of peoples. Take this conference out of the hands of the bankers and maybe the world will get a better deal.”</span></p>

One of the stories was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Catskill, a group of men sat in a blacksmith shop during a violent thunder storm. There came an awful crash of thunder and some of the men trembled, but one of them said, “I do not seo what you are afraid of. I am not afraid to go outside of the shop and defy the Almighty. I am not afraid of lightning.” He laid down a wager, and went out and shook his fist at the heavens, saying, “Strike if you dare!” and instantly he fell under a fiery bolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No dates were given, and no places or states were given except in this one instance, but here was a clue. We followed it up. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">United States Official Postal Guide</span><span class="font6"> shows there is but one Catskill in the United States. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">International Gazetteer</span><span class="font6"> shows that there is but one in the world. The Encyclopedia tells all about it. But we have a better way of finding out. It is in the territory of the little company of Jehovah’s witnesses of which Frank Powell is the director, and Frank will tell us the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so we wrote to Frank and asked him to spare no effort to get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Would he please, at his convenience, “ascertain whether the incident said to have occurred at Catskill ever occurred; frankly, we do not believe it did, and think that a careful inquiry will show that somebody is lying.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And Frank came back with the statement, “We made several inquiries regarding the incident which is said to have occurred in Catskill, and not one knew or ever heard of such a thing.” And all this is as we would have expected. And, mind you, of the five stories in the tract this is the only one susceptible of investigation.</span></p>

In that territory, to my knowledge, such treatment would be brooked least of all, at least as little as in the other South-African protectorates, where the native, and not the white man, gets preference in most things. The difference in the status of the native south of the Zambesi and that north of it is very<sup>7</sup> marked to any observer the moment one crosses this river. It is not a general practice in Southern Rhodesia to whip natives with rhinoceros-hide whips. If individuals here and there are guilty of such practice, it is not due to any<sup>7</sup> governmental sanction or policy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our error seems to have been in mentioning Northern instead of Southern Rhodesia as the scene of native whippings. It is certainly a comfort to know that these whippings do not constitute a governmental policy. We are sure that this must be of considerable consolation to the native being whipped.

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE new Declaration of Independence, adopted by the new Continental Congress at Washington, D.C., on May 7, went after the big financiers as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They have drawn billions in profit, rent, and interest; and they have slashed our wages and the prices of our farm products. They have used the marvels of the machine age, not to lift the burden of toil from our shoulders, but to speed us up beyond human endurance, and to throw us jobless upon the streets. They have taken the products of our labor, and not paid us enough to buy back the goods we have produced. They have wasted our natural, technical, and human resources, and led us into ever more tragic periods of industrial chaos. They have mortgaged our farms, and then sold them from under us. They have lived in mansions and evicted us from our homes. They have led us to trust in their banks, and then have stolen our savings. They have invaded our civil liberties, and thrown our leaders into jail. They have intrenched themselves in power by controlling the schools, the press, and the government. They have spent billions on bombs and battleships while we have gone cold and hungry. They have forced us to bleed and die in defense of their loans and markets abroad, and to kill our fellow workers in other countries. They have done these things as part and parcel of a profit system which places the few in control of gigantic monopolies, and puts profit above human life. Since the first Declaration of Independence the American people have discovered and created the means for unheard-of wealth. Wide rivers have been tamed to provide electric power, huge mountains have been tunneled to give ore for the creation of new and marvelous machines, and the prairies have been made to yield rich crops. Man’s power to produce wealth has been increased a hundredfold, until now a life of security and abundance is possible for all. But today the nation starves in the midst of plenty. The gigantic machines stand idle, the crops lie in warehouses or rot in the fields. The system is collapsing before our very eyes. ’ ’</span></p>

Machines on the loose are a menace to society, but properly married they are economical housewives. Separate the machines from corporations, wed them to the government legitimately, teach them productive birth control, and instead of breeding technological unemployment the machine will be pregnant with blessings, enabling the work of the world to be completed in a few hours a day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The banks have made such large profits that their $100 shares have sold as high as $4,200. To conceal this increase they then split the shares so that their dividends would not appear so enormous.

The holdings of the president of the First National Bank increased $31,000,000 in three days in 1929, each original $100 invested paying nearly $2,000 a year in dividends.</span></p>

Not infrequently the banker finally gets all the assets of the business and the people get stock certificates which they can use instead of wall paper. But one thing they do get and never part with is the certainty of paying more forevermore for the necessity, whatever it is that the bankers started out to get.</span></p>

Without a doubt it liked to lap up a saucer of milk, poured for it by a benefactor. Without a doubt it rubbed against somebody’s legs, to show its utter and absolute friendliness. And if it had half a chance it leaped from the floor into somebody’s lap, and when that somebody scratched back of its ears, ever so gently, and stroked its glossy fur, it closed its eyes and was off in dreamland in a minute, enjoying the only heaven a cat can ever know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what is this that we see in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American Journal of Physiology</span><span class="font6"> for August, 1931? It tells about what some medical men did to this poor pussy. Of course, pussy had a vagus; and so have you. The vagus is your pneumogastric nerve; it operates your lungs and stomach. It furnishes power for voice, heart, liver and spleen. If anything happens to it you are in a bad way, and if anything happens to pussy’s vagus, pussy is in a bad way, too. And here is what happened:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The branches of the right (or left) vagus were cut as they left the vagal trunk, from above the recurrent laryngeal to below the bifurcation of the trunk on the esophagus (gullet). The trunk itself was isolated along this extent. The other vagus was cut in the neck. The upper thoracic sympathetic chains were removed. The free end of the trimmed vagus was brought out of the chest through the second interspace for stimulation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How would you like to have somebody cut one of the greatest and most important systems of nerves in your body and pull the loose end of it out between your ribs so as to further torment you by irritating the loose end thus exposed to view?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Poor pussy could no longer cry out. The nerve she would have used to do so was cut, and that made it impossible. Well! And what could she do, at the end of her poor life, to provide compensation to anybody for what she suffered? Only this. Read it, and if you can see anything to it except torture for the fun of torturing, then you are brilliant indeed.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>Obedience to the Lord Brings Strength</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">TF </span><span class="font6">YOU were asked to name the ten strongest, most manly men that have ever lived, you would be almost certain to put Daniel in the list. You might put him as one of the first five. Before Jesus’ day God himself put him as one of five, Noah, Job, Moses and Samuel being the other four. Not even Abraham, Joseph, David or Isaiah seems to have had such an honored place.—Ezekiel 14:14, 20; Jeremiah 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you got to thinking on the subject you would not go far, probably, before you ■would find yourself humming the old tune, or perhaps saying half aloud to yourself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Dare to be a Daniel;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dare to stand alone;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dare to have a purpose firm And dare to make it known. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And yet, physically Daniel did not have the strength of a woman or of a growing boy or girl; for he was a eunuch. Only one in four survives this terrible operation which strikes the tree of manhood at its roots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the barbarous custom of the east thus to treat captives, and as Daniel and his companions were under the care of the prince of the eunuchs (Daniel 1:7) it is certain that he was one himself. Isaiah prophesied of a day when the descendants of the Jewish kings should be “eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon”. (Isaiah 39:7) Daniel was one of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well known that the operation performed upon Daniel and his companions has the tendency to repress courage, gentleness, shame and remorse, and is liable to bring on malice, melancholy and suicide. These facts tend to throw into even greater light the astonishing courage and gentleness of Daniel and his companions, and reveal clearly that the source of their strength was nothing within themselves but was strength supplied to them by Jehovah God.— Habakkuk 3:19; Psalm 71:15,16.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>Strength Made Perfect in Weakness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">If all men that would serve the Lord could get to the place where they would entirely forget themselves, they would be much more usable than when a measure of self-interest, self-importance or self-aggrandizement is mixed with it; but the Lord does not desert those whose hearts are right, even if they do have to fight a lifelong battle with these handicaps. This is all nicely set out for us in the experiences of the apostle Paul:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And lest I should be exalted above measure </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font5">the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.—2 Corinthians 12: 7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophets recognized the same principle. Thus in the passage from Habakkuk, above cited, the prophet says: “[Jehovah] God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The passage from the Psalm, also cited, is to the same effect: “My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day. ... I will go in the strength of the Lord God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When one has the facts, there are certain passages in Daniel’s prophecy that are very touching : “And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days: afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business.” (Daniel 8: 27) Still more significant is this one:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font5">comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength. And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands: and he said unto me, 0 Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">stood trembling. And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, and said, 0 man greatly beloved, fear not; peace be unto thee; be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.—Daniel 10:8,10,11,16-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Three Years on a Vegetable Diet</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel and his companions were in training as courtiers of the king. They had been care-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fully selected for their pleasing personal appearance, natural intelligence, skill in learning science and the languages, and their general adaptability as counselors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To strengthen them, in the period when they were recovering from their operation, and were in training for a place at the council board, a daily allowance of meat and wine was made for each, which meat and wine, in accordance with the custom of the times, had first been offered to idols; for the king was a heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the first test, and at every subsequent test, Daniel showed his obedience to Jehovah God, and his determination to do what he conceived to be God’s will, no matter what might result; and so we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.—Daniel 1: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God knew that this question would come up. He knew that Daniel had been carefully reared in the Jewish faith, knew his conscientiousness, his reverence for God, and so arranged that his first battle should be a victory. The key to the situation rested in the prince of the eunuchs. “Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with” this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prince explained to Daniel that he feared to disobey the king; if he should comply with Daniel’s request, and omit the meat and wine from the diet of himself and his companions, and the thing should be discovered, and it would be apparent that these four men were making less progress than their fellows, it would cost him his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel proposed that the matter be tried out ten days; they would go on a vegetable diet for that time, and would drink water instead of wine. At the end of that time they would accept his decision. He consented, and the Lord blessed the arrangement. At the end of ten days they had made noticeable progress, had put on flesh and were every way improved. That settled it, and they went on the vegetable diet for the whole three years.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>The God of Heaven Stops a Massacre</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">When the young courtiers were brought before the king and examined, at the end of the three years, it was found that Daniel and his companions were ten times as bright and ten times as well posted as any other wise men in the realm. The next test followed speedily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The king had a dream that troubled him, but he forgot the dream itself. He had all the older courtiers called in, and demanded that they recall his dream and give the explanation or he would have them all put to death as frauds. They could not comply with his request; so he gave orders that all should be slain, including Daniel and his companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When they came to Daniel he pleaded for a day’s delay in the execution of the sentence of death, laid the matter before his three companions, and together they besought the God of heaven for the help without which they must perish. The help came that night, when the whole vision was made clear to Daniel, a vision which spans all history from that day to now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel’s first thought was of the great One who had answered their prayers, and had become their rescuer, their wisdom and their might:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his: and he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding. He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. I thank thee, and praise thee, 0 thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.— Daniel 2: 20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Promptly Daniel was brought in before the king, and the God that he acknowledged in the night seasons he acknowledged in open court. His statement of the dream and its interpretation was so overwhelmingly convincing that Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face before him, worshiped him, and commanded that an oblation and incense should be offered to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel was made a great man; great gifts were given to him; he was made ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors of the wise men who but for him would have been put to death. His three companions at prayer were placed in responsible positions also.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>Delivered from the Midst of the Flames</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It was not long after the elevation of Daniel to a high place in the realm, and the exaltation of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego under him, that these three men came in for an experience that showed they were of the same mind as Daniel. He was probably away on a journey at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar had set up on the plain of Dura a huge image of gold and summoned to the dedication representatives of the eight departments of his government: princes, governors, captains, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These were told that when the orchestra should strike up, conveying the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and other musical instruments of the time, they must all fall down and worship this golden image or be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The three Hebrews above named were present, as was their duty, but refrained from falling down and worshiping the image, as was also their duty not to do. They were accused before the king. He summoned them and graciously offered to give them a second chance. This indicates that he considered them valuable men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego gave the king an answer that will abide for all time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thine hand, 0 king. But if not, be it known unto thee, 0 king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.—Daniel 3:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nebuchadnezzar’s fury knew no bounds. It is supposed that he ordered seven times the usual quantity of crude naphtha thrown into the furnace, to make sure that the fire would be the worst ever known. It was; it slew the men that threw these eunuchs into the flames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But they themselves, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, were injured not at all. Nebuchadnezzar was made to know that their deliverer was and is the Son of God. He called them forth from the flames, promoted them, and decreed that any person that should speak anything amiss against their God should be cut in pieces and his house be made a dunghill.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Warning a King of Impending Insanity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">It seems as if it would be a task that would burden the stoutest heart to have to go to any person and tell him he was about to go insane, and it seems as if this job would be still harder if the one to be notified were an autocractic ruler, accustomed to consigning to instant death any who might offend him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have plenty of evidence that Nebuchadnezzar was a dangerous man. The prince of the eunuchs feared for his life if he failed to give his charges the diet that had been prescribed for him. Because they could not tell him his dream, and therefore he felt certain could not tell him the explanation of it, Nebuchadnezzar would have slain every one of his wise men; and he did order the death of those who refused to worship the golden image which he had set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Very likely Daniel knew all of these and many similar circumstances; it is certain that he knew the first two, and he could hardly have failed to be apprised of the experiences of his three friends. And now he was suddenly called in to explain a dream the significance of which no one else in the realm could or would explain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the dream was told to Daniel he saw at once that the purport of it was that the king would be insane for seven years, and it is not therefore to be wondered at that he was dumb with astonishment for about an hour, and that his thoughts troubled him. The king saw the situation, perhaps sensed what was coming, and told Daniel not to let the dream or its interpretation trouble him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thereupon, in language that is famous for its kindness and its gentleness, but yet withal is plain, Daniel said to him, ‘My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. . . . They shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this came to pass upon Nebuchadnezzar, and after seven years his reason returned, he was reestablished in his kingdom, and his lords and counselors sought him out and aided him as aforetime in the administration of his far-flung empire. The last we see of him on the pages of history is his own account of his experiences, and his conclusion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.—Daniel 4: 37.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>Warning Another King of His Doom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">Hard as it would be to tell an absolute monarch he was about to go insane, it would be harder still to tell one that he had brought his kingdom to ruin and that it was about to be taken from him, but Daniel had that task assigned to him and fulfilled it perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While dishonoring the vessels of the house of Jehovah God, Belshazzar saw a hand write upon the wall the words that spelled his doom. Others were unable to explain their significance, but the queen heard of the incident, knew of Daniel, and the high place he had held with Nebuchadnezzar, and urged that he send for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Daniel came in, told Belshazzar what had happened to his father, and reminded him that he had not humbled his heart, though he knew all this. He then explained to him that the words which he had seen, “Mene, Mene, Tekel, Uphar-sin,” meant that he had been weighed in the balances and found wanting, and that his kingdom was divided and would be given to the Medes and Persians. The prophecy was fulfilled that very night, for even then Darius and his army were marching into the city of Babylon through the dry bed of the Euphrates, and Belshazzar was slain before the morning light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This incident restored Daniel to prominence and high favor in the kingdom. While Belshazzar yet lived Daniel was made the third ruler in the realm, and with the accession of Darius he was made the first of the three presidents that ruled the 120 provinces, and because of his excellent spirit the king thought to set him over the whole empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What followed is familiar ground to every lover of God’s Word, but linger again in the garden of the Lord and see the same old Haman story (Esther 3:1-15) reenacted to its conclusion in the life of this physically weak man that the angels of God, fresh from the courts of heaven, called “greatly beloved” because he walked with God and God was his strength and his life.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>The Conspiracy Against His Life</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God. Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king’s decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Then answered they, and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords, that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him; and his sleep went from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel; and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It seems that the Haman crowd never learn anything, and they do not know anything now. Daniel was wise, really wise, and he was strong too, because he was strong in the Lord. And that is the only kind of strength that amounts to anything; for it is the only kind that endures. Everything looks good to the Haman crowd until they come to the last act, and then nothing could look worse. When Daniel headed for the lions’ den he went in peace; the others went in terror. He may have had a lion for a pillow, and the angels safeguarded him while he slept. He came out to new honors, and to find that all his enemies had come to an untimely end. He had all the best of it, and Jehovah’s people always do have the best of it: for in the last act they get justice, and sometimes get it before.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"> In II Machabees 12: 43-46 the whole text is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And making a gathering, he sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection. (For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should also again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to pray for the dead.) And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be appal ent instantly to any honest person that the writer of this apocryphal book (which is really no part of the inspired Holy Scriptures, and therefore no part of the Bible itself) plainly teaches that the dead are asleep, awaiting a resurrection. He says nothing about a purgatory, and as a matter of fact the purgatory doctrine was not invented until the time of Gregory the Great, more than six hundred years after Christ’s death.</span></p>
