<p><span class="font7">It would be a real comfort and joy to all sane persons to know for a certainty that there is to be lasting peace on earth, and prosperity with plenty for all. Men do not possess the power to bring these desirable things to the world, but nothing i s impossible with Jehovah. It is apparent to all that the efforts of men to bring about a desirable condition have failed for the reason that all men are imperfect. Now let the people hear what the great God has to say. The proof is conclusive that soon Jehovah will bring to the peoples of earth lasting peace, great prosperity, perfect health in happiness, and everlasting life. I ask you to give a hearing ear while I relate to you the Scriptural proof. I hope those who are sad may receive comfort when hearing this message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God put a perfect man on earth and told him he must obey, and that disobedience to God's law would result in man's death. The Devil opposed Jehovah God, and man fell away to the Devil, and in harmony with His law God sentenced man to death. By reason thereof and by inheritance death passed upon all men, and for this cause sickness and death have been upon the people.—Romans 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah gave His promise that in due time He would bring forth His mighty One, by and through whom all the families of the earth shall be blessed. (Genesis 12: 3) That promised One is Christ Jesus, the earth’s rightful Ruler. (Galatians 3:8, 16, 27-29) Before fallen man could be blessed the disability resulting from original sin must be removed, and that could be removed only by another perfect man’s dying in the place or stead of the sinner. Moved by unselfishness God sent Jesus to earth, who became a man and died in the sinner’s place; and thus his shed blood furnished the redemptive price for man. (John 3:16; 1 Timothy 2: 3-6) God raised up Jesus out of death, not as a man, but as the divine One, and appointed Him to the high office of Ruler of the world and the Vindicator of God’s holy name. When Jesus ascended into heaven He did not immediately assume His high office, because Jehovah said to Him: ‘Wait until my due time to make the enemy thy footstool.’ (Psalm 110:1) Jesus has waited, and now God’s due time has come and He has sent forth Jesus to rule and judge the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;When Jesus was on earth He emphasized above everything else the kingdom of God and the vindication of His Father’s name. He promised to return and to establish that kingdom amongst men. During the long period of waiting, from the time of His ascension into heaven until the return of Christ Jesus, Satan, unhindered, has built up a mighty organization that has violently opposed God and His kingdom. The Scriptural proof, fully supported by the physical facts, is that 1914 marked the end of the waiting period and the time for Christ Jesus to begin His reign. (Matthew 24:1-22) Jehovah immediately sent Jesus forth to rule and to oust the enemy. (Psalm 110:2-4) Satan refused to vacate, and, he resisting, war followed in heaven and Satan was cast out of heaven down to the earth, where he continues to operate, although invisible to human eyes. (Revelation 12:1-17) It is the expressed will of Jehovah God that Satan and his mighty organization now must he destroyed in order that the name of Jehovah may be vindicated and that the peoples of earth may, unhindered, have opportunity to receive the blessings of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next great event is the battle of Armageddon, which will result in the destruction of Satan’s organization. In the meantime God is causing this truth to be told to the nations as a witness, that those who desire to do so may take their stand on God's side and be brought through that great battle and be the first to receive the blessings of the Kingdom. To be sure, Satan will do and is doing what he can to prevent the people from hearing the truth. Imperfect men who rule the world are blind to God’s purposes. They have no vision of His kingdom, and hence have fallen easy victims to Satan. They are trying to bring peace and prosperity; but they are destined to abject failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Will the kingdom of God under Christ bring peace to the world? Yes, everlasting peace. When the man child Jesus was born at Bethlehem Jehovah caused His heavenly messenger to announce that in His due time this mighty One would bring peace to the earth and good will toward men. (Luke 2:9-14) Jehovah always fulfils His promises in due time, and this one is certain to be fulfilled. By His prophet Jehovah, referring to the same mighty One, says, in Isaiah 9: G, 7: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.” Those who have faith in Jehovah and His Word know that this promise is certain to be kept and fulfilled by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the light of the clear statement by the mouth of Almighty God why should you, the people, longer stand in perplexity and in doubt and listen to the claims of imperfect men that they can bring peace and prosperity to the earth'! The time has come when the people must choose between God and the Devil; when they must hear Jehovah God, obey Him and live, or follow blind guides into death. I am not even begging you to obey God. If a man does not see that it is his greatest privilege and favor to serve Jehovah God he does not deserve to live. Jehovah is now causing the truth to be proclaimed to the people, that they may gain a vision of His purposes: therefore it is written (Proverbs 29:18) : “Where there is no vision, the people perish; but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.” If you would live and be happy, take your place in Jehovah's organization. It is His kingdom under Christ that will bring to you lasting peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today there is great fear of war between the nations, and for that reason the nations prepare for war. If there were but one ruler of all the earth and that ruler were perfect in wisdom and exercised his power justly toward all, there; could be no war between the nations. In the kingdom of God there is but one Ruler, Christ Jesus, the chief executive of Jehovah, in whom resides all power and authority and which has been committed into His hands by the Almighty. (Matthew 28:18) He is perfect in justice, wisdom, love and power. Christ Jesus is the express image of Jehovah. (Hebrews 1:1-9) Christ Jesus is the rightful Ruler of the world, and concerning Him it is written in God's Word (Psalm 45:6): ‘Thy throne is for ever and ever, and the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.’ Speaking by His prophet Jehovah says concerning Jesus the King (Isaiah 55:4): ‘I have given him for a leader and a commander of the people.’ If you will live, follow His leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore He says to Jesus (Isaiah 49:8): “I . . . give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause [the people] to inherit the desolate [places].” Christ the King will rule in absolute righteousness, and before Him all shall have equal opportunity to be blessed. (1 Peter 1:17; Psalm 119:137) In times past all of us have believed that man must die and go to heaven in order to be blessed; but now God's due time has come for the people to receive a clearer understanding of His purposes, which show that only a few men will ever go to heaven and that the mass of those who live will find an everlasting abiding-place on earth, which will be made a fit and desirable place to dwell for ever in happiness. God declares in His Word that He made the earth for man to inhabit and that “the earth abideth for ever”.—Isaiah 45:12,18; Ecclesiastes 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So long have the people lived under the cruel lash of imperfect rulers that they wonder if it will ever be thus. The Scriptures answer, Xo; but, on the contrary, God's kingdom under Christ will be a righteous government and no imperfect men will have anything to do with the rulership or any opportunity to oppress their fellow man. (Daniel 2:44) Since Christ Jesus will ever be invisible to human eyes, who, then, will have to do with the visible administration of God’s kingdom on earth? The Scriptures answer that the administration of the affairs of the earthly government will be in the hands of those only who are of God’s organization. A number of such men are specifically named in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. From Abel to John, the forerunner of Christ, there lived on earth a few men who maintained their integrity toward God and who testified with their lifeblood their faithfulness to the Most High. The promise of Jehovah is, as set forth in the Scriptures, that when Christ’s kingdom is set up those faithful men will be resurrected from the dead and become the visible representatives of Christ’s government on earth. Because of their faithfulness God expressly states that He has made a place for them in His kingdom. (Hebrews 11:16-40) And what shall be their position in His kingdom on earth ? The Scriptures answer, at Psalm 45:16, that these faithful men, brought back from death as perfect men, shall be made the governors, that is, the visible representatives of Christ on earth, and shall act under the authority of that absolute and righteous Dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are today millions of people on earth who will see those faithful men of old resurrected from the dead and brought back as perfect men to administer the affairs of government under Christ; and concerning the operation of that government it is written, in Isaiah 32:1: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There must be one more war to clean out the wicked organization of Satan, and that is the war of the great day of God Almighty, or Armageddon. It is made necessary because Satan holds the people in subjection and deties Jehovah God and earth's rightful King. Therefore Jehovah says to Christ His King (Psalm 45: 3,4): “Gird thy sword on thy thigh, 0 most Mighty [One],... And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.” With the conclusion of the battle of Armageddon there will never be another war, but peace will abide in the earth for ever. God uses the everlasting mountains of stone to symbolize His kingdom, and concerning the end of war and lasting peace He says by the mouth of His prophet Micah (4: 1-4): “But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain [kingdom] of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains [kingdoms], and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain [kingdom] of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem [God's organization]. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">War among the peoples of the nations is a cruel and devilish thing. It is greed and hatred, induced by the Devil, that leads the people to war with each other. Jehovah God never indulges in war except to justly punish those wicked ones who oppress mankind and defame God’s holy name. The people fear Avar and greatly desire peace. They desire a righteous rule that will for ever guarantee them peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The One desired is the King of righteousness and peace, Christ, the mighty executive ollicer of Jehovah, although most of the people arc without knowledge of His kingdom. (Haggai 2:6, 7; Romans 8:19-22) It is God’s kingdom on earth under Christ that will bring lasting peace to the people. The efforts of selfish men can never accomplish such, and it is folly to believe they can. The Lord does not say that men should set aside a period of time and during that period pray for peace upon the nations; but He does say, ‘When you pray say: Thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth as in heaven/ In order to have peace on earth the people who do enjoy it must become a part of God’s organization, which is symbolized in the Scriptures by Jerusalem. The Head of that organization is Christ Jous, the King; therefore Jehovah commands His faithful witnesses to now lift high the banner of truth and point the people to the Kingdom. (Isaiah 62:10) He does not command the people that they shall pray for peace at Rome or for “Christendom”, but He does say, in Psalm 122: 6, 7: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem [meaning God’s organization] : they shall prosper<sup>-</sup> that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.” Such a prayer, uttered in sincerity, puts men in a mental attitude of harmony with God’s organization and in a position to receive His blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The greatest crisis experienced by human creatures has now been reached. For centuries the people have suffered through war and other violent deeds of selfishness. but now the change for good is imminent. Christ, the King of righteousness, has been enthroned, and with the destruction of the enemy organization He will clear the way that all who will may joyfully enter into the organization of God on earth. Therefore Jehovah commands His faithful witnesses in these words (Psalm 96:10,11,13): &quot;Say among the [nations] that the Lord reigneth : the world also shall he established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. . . . Before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.” Here, by the Word of God, is the complete guarantee that the kingdom under Christ will establish the world in righteousness and bring lasting peace to the people. Upon that you can rely with complete confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why should the people continue to walk on in darkness with their heads bowed down, following in the steps of blind human guides'? Why not lift up the head and look unto God and His kingdom and the gracious and bountiful provision He has made for those who love and obey Him? Centuries ago the Lord foretold this hour of distress and perplexity that has come upon the peoples of earth, and He declares that this is evidence that Satan’s wicked world has ended and that the Lord’s kingdom is here and that shortly He will relieve the people who look to Him and obey Him. His prophecy and the physical facts in fulfilment thereof abundantly show that we have now come to the Kingdom and that the day of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am not begging you to enter God’s organization. but as one of Jehovah’s witnesses I am pointing you to the facts, that you may do what you desire. Man’s greatest privilege is to know and to serve Jehovah God, because there is no other way of receiving life and its attending blessings. The reason for the giving of the wide witness concerning Jehovah and His kingdom is that the people may be informed, and, when informed, an obligation rests upon you to take one course or the other. Knowledge and understanding are essential to you; therefore Jehovah says that those who have no vision of His purposes perish, and those who hear and obey His law, happy are they.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah caused the Psalms to be written for the comfort and hope of those who love and serve Him, and now He discloses that His kingdom is here and the lime when these precious promises may be understood and appreciated. In the seventy-second Psalm Jehovah enumerates some of the blessings His King and kingdom will bring to the people, wherein it is written (Psalm 72: 2, 6-9): “He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass; as showers that water the earth. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endur-eth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.” These blessings could not come by the efforts of men who set aside a time and call it a “holy year”, but they can come to you only by and through the kingdom of God, which is now at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today you stand in perplexity and look with fear and trembling as to what the year may bring forth. What shall you do? God through His prophet, at the eighty-fifth Psalm, puts the words in the mouth of each sincere one who desires righteousness and peace, and causes him to say (verses 8, 9): “I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints; but let them not turn again to folly. Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.'<sup>-</sup>'’ Then those people who turn away from the teachings of men and give ear to God's Word have a further vision of Jehovah’s purposes, and by faith they see the blessings that the Kingdom will bring, and in the language of the psalmist they joyfully say (verses 10-12): ‘‘Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The history of the nations shows that at all times a few men have prospered in material things and that the masses of the people have often been in want. Today, when the earth has revealed greater material wealth than ever before, there are millions in every nation suffering for the necessities of life. To be sure, all of these desire prosperity, and there are a few men who attempt to bring about prosperity by setting aside a time to pray for such. The Scriptures show that prayer is answered by the Lord only when asked in harmony with His will. Prosperity can come to all the people only by and through God’s kingdom under Christ, and God has so declared. Why has not prosperity come to all through the efforts of men? Because there is no righteous ruler on the earth, for the reason that all men are imperfect. At Proverbs 29: 2,14 it is written: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.” Christ Jesus is the faithful One who will rule in righteousness, and prosperity for the people will come with His universal rule, and in no other way. Concerning Him it is written, in Isaiah 11:5: “And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now in this day, when Jehovah has installed His King, He instructs His faithful witnesses to pray for prosperity of the Kingdom. (Psalm 118:19-20) That means not merely material prosperity, but an abundance of other attending blessings of righteousness and goodness amongst men. Their prayers do not hasten the prosperity, but puts those who do sincerely pray in a proper attitude to receive the blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,” and those who obey Him in His kingdom shall receive God’s abundant provision for their welfare and happiness. (Psalm 24:1-5) No man shall be permitted to prosper, under the reign of Christ, at the expense of his neighbor, and this is made sure because nothing shall be permitted to hurt in all that holy kingdom. •—Isaiah 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The farmers and small wage earners have bestowed their labor upon the lands that have yielded the food to feed the people, while at the same time financial giants, void of conscience and moved by greed, have grown rich by manipulating the price of foodstuffs and by unrighteous dealing in the fruits upon which they have bestowed no labor. Having gained possession of most of the money of the land, they have loaned money upon the farms and houses, secured by mortgages, and on which they collect exorbitant rates of interest; and now the result is that the farmers and modest-home owners are in great distress because they are being stripped of their life earnings and their property is being taken away by foreclosure of mortgages. Because of this alarming and deplorable condition the governments are adopting </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">experimental</span><span class="font7"> plans in an effort to save the farmers and the home owners. All of such efforts are certain to fail, because the mortgage holders, like Shylock, demand the pound of flesh and, being unable to get their money, they take the farms and houses, and the people are turned out to suffer and die. God hears the cries of distress of the oppressed and declares that He will take a hand in behalf of suffering humanity. The crash is certain to come, and then what ? God’s kingdom under Christ will install a just and righteous method of dealing with the people, under which system one class shall not be permitted to profit at the expense of another. There will be no very rich and no very poor, but all must assume a common level. The righteous King being in authority, the people will rejoice, because then they will have an assurance of enjoying the fruits of their labors. Concerning this, God through His prophet says (Isaiah 65: 21,22) : ‘‘They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat.<sup>-</sup>’ The farmers and laborers will then be assured that they shall have enough to eat. They will not be made afraid of losing their homes, because, it is written, then every man shall sit under his own vino and fig tree, and nothing shall make them afraid.—Micah 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today in this land of abundance there are long lines of men, women and children begging for food, not because there is an insufficient supply of food, but because a few selfish men control what is in existence and the others are not able to find employment to earn money to pay for what they need. Such a condition could not possibly exist under the righteous reign of Christ, because all who Jive will then be glad to work and all will be permitted to eat. In support of this, note that God, at Isaiah 25:5,6, says: “The terrible ones [who have oppressed the people! shall be brought low. And in this mountain [kingdom] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often the farmers have been harassed by bugs, parasites, and other vermin which have destroyed their crops. They have been told that these pests are sent from God as punishment upon them. Such a charge is a defamation of God's holy name. Satan, the god of this wicked world, is responsible for such destructive pests, and his purpose is to cause the people to charge God with the responsibility therefor in order that the people may become discouraged and curse God and turn away from Him. Famine has often been the result of the ravages of these pests; but when the Kingdom is in operation and the people learn to obey God the promise to them, as written in Psalm 67, is that then God's saving health will be among the people and &quot;then shall the earth yield her increase”. —Verses 2, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Peter under inspiration from the Lord wrote that according to God's promise we look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. (2 Peter 3: 13) The new heaven is Jehovah's righteous organization under Christ, the invisible ruler of the kingdom of righteousness. The new earth is the visible part of God's organization that shall govern the affairs of the earth. The new heaven and new earth is the kingdom of God for the vindication of His name and for the blessing of the people. In harmony with this Jesus caused John to write, in Revelation 21:1: “And I save a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.” This symbolic language describes God’s kingdom for the blessing of the people. It is called “the holy city&quot; or organization, through which God acts to carry forward His purposes. Further describing such kingdom The Revelation (21:3) there says: “And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now concerning some of the further benefits th.e Kingdom will bring to the obedient ones, take note. For many centuries the people have suffered much sickness, and millions have gone down in sorrow to the grave. Bitter tears have bathed the cheeks of every adult person because death has taken away some loved one. To add to their sorrow and to cause the people to curse God, Satan has caused his agents to falsely teach the people that their beloved dead are conscious in purgatory or in eternal torture, there undergoing everlasting pain and suffering. The Scriptures abundantly teach that the dead are unconscious and not alive and not undergoing suffering anywhere. They are in their graves, and they know not anything, awaiting God’s due time to call them forth in the resurrection and give them an opportunity under the Kingdom to obey its righteous laws and live. (Ecclesiastes 9:5,10) Jesus with authority stated (John 5:28,29): ‘All are in their graves, and the hour is coming in which they shall all be brought forth from the graves and given a trial for life, and they that obey shall have life and shall not die.’ That will be one of the great boons and benefits resulting from the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are millions of persons living on earth today who will see the Kingdom in operation and see their dead friends awakened out of death, and it will he their privilege to aid such to understand that if they are obedient to the laws of God's kingdom they shall live forever upon the earth. Satan has fraudulently induced the people to believe that death is a friend of man, while the Word of God shows that death is man's great enemy. L<sup>T</sup>nder the righteous reign</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of Christ Jesus this enemy, Death, shall be destroyed; as it is written (1 Corinthians 15:25, 26): “For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.’’ The lifeblood of Christ Jesus was shed for the benefit of all men, and in the Kingdom all men must be brought to a knowledge of the truth and given an opportunity to be obedient to the Kingdom laws and receive the benefits thereof, which include life everlasting in the earth. For that reason Christ Jesus is named the Savior of the world, and it is written that there is no other name given under heaven wherebv we must be saved.—Acts 4:12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The vindication of Jehovah’s holy mime is the most important truth contained in the Bible. Jehovah Cod is the fountain of all truth and life. Satan is the fountain head of lies and death. (John 8: 44) Long ago Satan challenged God to put men on earth who would be faithful to Him; hence Jehovah has permitted Satan to do his worst in his effort to prove his wicked challenge. In the long period of time from Eden till now a few men have remained true to God, and these have been to that extent a vindication of Jehovah’s name. Millions of others have died without knowing Jehovah, but when these are awakened out of death and brought back from the grave and given a knowledge of the truth they will have an opportunity to obey God and live, and by doing so that will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. The time is at hand to settle the great question at issue, as to who is the Supreme One in the universe. Shortly Satan and his organization shall die, and then the benefits of God's kingdom shall be open to all. The living shall first hear, and then the dead shall be awakened that they may hear, obey and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For centuries Satan has cast a veil of covering over the eyes of the people and made them blind to the truth. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Under the reign of God’s righteous King that veil of covering shall be taken away, that all may know the Lord from the least to the greatest and that those who obey then shall live, and no more shall men suffer rebuke because they have faithfully served Jehovah God. It is written (Isaiah 25 : 7-9): “He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces: and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day [by the people], Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God will dwell in His holy organization and operate the affairs of earth for the good of those who obey its righteous laws. In confirmation of this it is written, in Revelation 21:4: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.’’ Abundantly blessed the people will be when there shall be no more tears and sorrow and when they have no more fear of death or any such thing. Then they will dwell together in peace and prosperity and enjoy happiness without interruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To those who hear Jehovah and take their stand on His side He now says (Isaiah 66:1; 60: 13) : &quot;The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. . . . And I will make the place of my feet glorious.” Under the kingdom of Christ all things that offend and do injury shall be for ever removed and the earth will be made a lit place for righteous persons to dwell. That will mean that those who do obey and live will be wholly devoted to God and to His kingdom. Such is true holiness. The claim made by men that holiness results from the holding of an office, speaking soft words and having a sanctimonious appearance, is entirely unscriptural and untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the Kingdom there will be no need for prisons and insane asylums, hospitals or drugs, because the Lord will heal the mind and body of all those who obey Him. The wicked influence of Satan even upon the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air will be taken away, and these will be singing the praises of Jehovah the great God. Horses have heretofore symbolized War and War equipment, because men have used them for such purposes. Under the Kingdom there Will be no more War; and concerning the horses it is Avritten: &quot;In that day shall there be upon the bolls of the horses [the inscription], HOLINESS UNTO [JEHOVAH].” (Zechariah 14: 20) In symbolic phrase, these bells Will call attention to the fact that every’ creature that continues to live Will give honor and glory’ to Jehovah God, </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">avIio</span><span class="font7"> by and through the administration of His kingdom has brought boundless blessings to all creation. All then Will be Avholly and completely devoted to His righteous cause. God gave His faithful prophet a vision of this coming day of blessings for the peoples of earth under His kingdom. Moved by gratitude that prophet, at the 150th Psalm, used these words: ‘’Praise ye [Jehovah] ; . . . Let every thing that hath breath praise the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.”</span><span class="font7"> This will be the proper attitude of all the peoples of earth when the kingdom of God under Christ has brought them under the complete control and blessings of that righteous rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this brief speech I can merely call attention to some of the blessings the Kingdom will bring to the people. A book called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government </span><span class="font7">sets forth the matter more in detail, and therein you will find cited numerous scriptures fully proving that the Kingdom is the only hope of the world. There now come to you faithful men and women who are, by His grace, Jehovah’s witnesses, and who are bringing to you the message of truth for your aid and comfort. These witnesses ate not prompted by any selfish desire, but bring to you this message in obedience to God’s commandment, that you may have an opportunity to make your choice as to whom you will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The hour is here for you to have serious thought. The entire population of the earth is in distress and perplexity. There is but one remedy, and that is God’s kingdom under Christ. Do not waste time by following the schemes of imperfect men. Regardless of the good intentions of such men their schemes are certain to meet with complete failure, because it is God’s time to set aside everything that is out of harmony with His kingdom. We all know that there are millions of people now mourning. I bid you to cease your weeping and dry your tears. Look up with faith and confidence to the hand of the gracious and almighty God, who will now smite the wicked world and then quickly heal all of the people who give obedience to His righteous laws. He is the God of justice, wisdom, love and power, and from His gracious hand comes everything that is for the well-being of creation. Let all creation turn to Him, obey His laws and give praise to His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the peoples of good will it is needless for me to say that you greatly desire peace, prosperity, life and happiness. To those who give heed to His law and obey God He now says: “The Lord knoweth the days of the upright; and their inheritance shall be for ever. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied. For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.” (Psalm 37:18,19, 22) “And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.” (Isaiah 32:17,18) ‘What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth, and dclivereth them out of all their troubles.” (Psalm 34:12-14,17) Blessings attempted to be bestowed upon you by men, regardless of their office or position, cannot make you rich; but, it is written, in Proverbs 10:22: “The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich; and he addeth no sorrow with it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God is your eternal Friend. His witnesses, of whom Christ Jesus is the chief, are your friends, because they bring to you the message of peace from the Father of mercies and God of all comfort. May that sweet message of His kingdom falling upon your ears lift you up out of your sorrow and bring comfort to your heart, and may you for ever be the recipients of Jehovah’s blessings and continue to give honor to His holy name.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Brightening the Day with “Kingdom Blessings”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font7">ID you hear Judge Rutherford's lecture, April 30, 1933, on “Kingdom Blessings”? Do you know of what it reminded one group of listeners? “He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth.” It was so gentle, so tender, so persuasive. The day, over a large part of the country served by the hook-up, was as beautiful as the message. Both were a gift from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sunshine pouring down through millions on millions of trees putting on their new spring suits: God’s bouquets, smiling and nodding in the softest of zephyrs. It was just the day for such a message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ulmer Turner, radio editor of the Chicago </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">J Jerald and Examiner,</span><span class="font7"> voiced our own sentiments perfectly when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Thank God for radio !’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A moment aim the telephone rang , . . Nothing unusual about the call at first ... It was just an excited woman who wanted to know when she could hear Judge Rutherford over the radio again . . . Consulting the Sunday schedule, I advised her to tune to KYW each Sunday at 1 p.m. for that feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Please do not hang up,” she, cried, “before I thank you ! I am blind and no one seems to care about me . . . Only the radio likes me . . . and it brings me such wonderful things . . . music, news and Judge Rutherford! . . . Thank God for radio!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After impressing upon her that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and Examiner</span><span class="font6"> radio department would always be glad to help her locate any programs she might want to hear, we bid each other good-by . . . But the incident brightened my whole day ... To realize that science in the past 1933 years has been able to contribute something that really helps all mankind, and particularly the afflicted . . . Just as a Stranger who came into our midst 1933 years ago . . . and Who, also, long before electrons were discovered, dedicated Himself to helping the afflicted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because it is the due time, the Lord is causing new light to shine from old texts as Judge Rutherford turns them over before the microphone. These old texts are like diamonds. Whichever way they are turned they shine with new beauty and brilliancy, and were made so to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just to catch at one of them, for an instant. The judge cpioted an old familiar text: &quot;When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked bearelh rule, the people mourn.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Almost anybody that would hear that text would say right away, &quot;Yes, I understand that text perfectly&quot; ; but after half a dozen sentences of exposition, wherein it is plainly shown that the righteous one is God's Anointed King, Christ Jesus, and the wicked one is the Devil, who is responsible for getting the world into present difficulties, the whole purpose of the text takes on a different aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That is a beautiful passage where, after showing the sadness that has resulted from the rule borne by the Wicked, and after showing the blessings that shall come from the rule of the King that shall reign in righteousness, the speaker said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Why should the people continue to walk on in darkness with their heads bowed down, following in the steps of blind human guides? Why not lift up the head and look unto God and His kingdom and the gracious and bountiful provision He has made for those who love and obey Him ?' ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is a nice recognition of free will and responsibility in this: &quot;T am not begging you to enter God's organization, but as one of Jehovah's witnesses I am pointing you to the facts, that you may do what you desire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of all the fine things written and spoken in our time, the address on &quot;Kingdom Blessings&quot; is one of the finest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM A FEW LETTERS AND TELEGRAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ann Arbor, Mich. “I have not words enough in my vocabulary to express how much I enjoyed your radio talk of Sunday last, and would appreciate a copy of same. In these times, when people in general are downhearted and discouraged, getting more pessimistic each day, it is a blessing to have someone come forward and tell them Christ alone is our strong hold in times of sorrow and depression, and help comes from Him.&quot; Mrs. A.L.F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arlington, Mass. “Wonderfid message. Lecture and music excellent. Reception perfect. Praise Jehovah.” A.M.G. and R.E.G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brooklyn, N.Y. “Your lecture ‘Kingdom Blessings for the People’ was heard with great enthusiasm. Reception excellent. More blessings to you from Jehovah.&quot; Italian company of Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chicago, Ill. “I listened with great interest to the address of Judge Rutherford this morning and would like to have a free copy of same, vith all other information in regard to writings and teachings of this able speaker. Heard over KYW, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and Examiner </span><span class="font7">station in Chicago. The writer is representative of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Horseman</span><span class="font7"> and was particularly anxious to have the references to the horses mentioned in Mr. Rutherford's address, as well as the many references to quotations from the Scriptures, their promises and their prophecies.” A.D.II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Detroit. Mich. “I listened to your address this morning and am thankful there is someone who is not afraid to tell the world the truth. I am in entire accord with your idea, but never in my 56 years have I heard any man explain my own feeling in regard to Christianity as you have done in your address ‘Kingdom Blessings for the People', and I respectfully ask that a copy of the same be sent me.” S.J.D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Independence, Ohio. “Everything perfect this end, all three stations. Magnificent climax. You never did better. Jehovah be praised.” M.A.H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hamilton, Ont. “Having heard your sermon on Sunday, I was delighted that you came out fearlessly on the cults of the day. We need men today who are fearless—the people are so deceived—and what a pity they are in that condition. I would very much like to receive this sermon by return mail.” Mrs. C.L.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Midland, Mich. “As a frequent listener to your Sunday broadcasting, it was my extreme delight and satisfaction to hear one of the most astounding speeches, delineating present-day events, that I have ever heard. Judge Rutherford's bold, drastic exposure and denunciation of modern-day religion as it is practiced by our clergy (those oily-tongued diplomats who stand rebuked by the teachings of the humble sage of Nazareth, whom they feign to worship and follow yet have obviously slandered in their insatiable greed for fame, fortune and popularity) is noteworthy indeed. I believe every honest American should feel as I do, that this most unique of broadcasters is doing humanity a great service. May he continue the good work and may it be your privilege to continue broadcasting these enlightening talks.” To Station WBCAI by R.E.P.</span></p>

I would appreciate a copy of today’s speech, and if you have last Sunday’s speech, could you possibly send that? I want to thank you very much. For a while I was nearly going out of my head—there are so many religions and which is the best is hard to decide. All my friends happen to be good Catholics. I have several Protestant friends, and when they begin discussing religion it becomes distasteful, because they are not speaking the truth, but they think they are. If they were to listen to Judge Rutherford, and hear the truth, they would feel so different. Would it not be wonderful if we all believed in one religion, and the people would know the truth and not the falsehoods that people are taught to believe nowadays ? Well, I am glad that our family are learning the truth, and I do hope people will soon realize how they are being fooled.” Miss U.K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Orillia, Ont. “Your address of Sunday, April 23, touched me more profoundly than anything I have heard for years, and I would like to congratulate you on the courage that enabled you to broadcast your honest convictions in regard to the chaos that greed, selfishness, and lack of divine inspiration has brought upon the nations today. Every word you uttered found an echo in my heart, and I felt that, though alone, in regard to real flesh and blood, kith and kin, you had given me a ‘touch of nature that makes all the world kin’. So seldom do I meet anyone who feels as poignantly along these lines as I do that I felt a sudden impulse to touch the radio with my hands, and make a living, breathing presence out of a voice. Thank God for your lack of ‘discretion’ and self-preservation, looking down from your Watchtower and telling them to come up, if they want to be saved from the floods that will one day engulf them.” M.P.</span></p>

He had to be well paid himself, so in addition to his salary he drew bonuses aggregating $3,481,732. He was grateful for the privilege of living in a country where he could do such things, and so he avoided paying any Federal income tax in 1929 by taking an alleged loss of $2,800,000 on a sale of bank stock to another member of his family, and then buying it back later on. Mr. C. E. Mitchell, while he was president of the National City Bank, built up a reputation for preaching rigid economy, retrenchment and elimination of graft.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Smitten with Fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IT </span><span class="font7">GIVES one a peculiar sensation when ho thinks of strong men and plenty of them trembling with fear in the presence of the truth. Every dignitary of the Roman Catholic church is well aware that the institution of which he is a part is not founded upon the Scriptures. Therefore his face blanches and his knees shake when brought face to face vith the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ‘’'pope'<sup>-</sup> knows that he accepts the title “Holy Father&quot;, which title occurs but once in the Scriptures, where it is used in H is last prayer, with infinite tenderness, by the only-begotten Son of God, and is addressed to Jehovah, the Creator, the Eternal Sovereign of the universe.—John 17 :11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ‘&quot;cardinals” know that they and all other clergy of the Roman Catholic church accept the title “father&quot;, yet they well know that Jesus taught His followers to “call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven”.—Matthew 23: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “archbishops” know that every Roman Catholic is taught to worship Mary, though they also know that she is but a creature and that the Scriptures are explicit that “thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve”. (Matthew 4:10) They also know that this is a quotation from Deuteronomy 6: 13,14, from the mouth of Jehovah God himself by the hand of Moses, “Thou shalt fear [Jehovah] thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. Ye shall not go after other gods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “bishops” know that the Roman Catholic church relies on Mary to protect her in great emergency, yet they know that the Scriptures hold out the hope of but one throne of grace to which the people of God may come boldly that they “may obtain mercy, and find grace to help) in time of need”. (Hebrews 4:16) They thus know that in establishing an unauthorized refuge “in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men&quot;.—Matthew 15: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “priests” know that under the canon law of the Roman Catholic church in Italy, and in every other country where the canon law is in effect, if one speaks against the “pope” it is required that the offender be punished severely, but they know that the Son of God himself said, “Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him.”—Matthew 12: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Afraid of the Scriptures</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy of the Roman Catholic church know that their literature teaches that Mary is the treasurer and the dispenser of mercies, yet they know that Jesus made the claim for himself alone that “all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth”.—Matthew 28:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The &quot;deacons&quot; know that it is the oft-repeated claim of the Roman Catholic church that the priest's power equals that of Christ, yet they know of the warning recorded in the Scriptures against “not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God”. (Colossians 2:19) On this point they also know that Jesus himself said, “Verily, verily, I say unto you, 1 am the door of the sheep. All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.”—John 10: 7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “priors” know that the Roman Catholic church seeks the admiration of the world and is comforted by it, but the Scriptures give the warning “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?”—James 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “deans” know that it is the teaching of the Roman Catholic church that hearing and believing are not necessary precedents to baptism, yet they know that the Scriptures teach that hearing and believing come first and baptism afterward.—Acts 18:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “prefects” know that the clergy of the Roman Catholic church and the bodyguard of the “pope&quot; are forbidden to marry and are commanded to abstain from meats on certain days, and yet they know that the Scriptures bear testimony of a time that would come when some would be guilty of “speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.&quot;—1 Timothy 4: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>In Terror of the Word of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “chief penitentiary” knows that the clergy alone of the Roman Catholic church drink</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the wine of the sacramental cup, but he knows that Jesus himself, when He instituted the memorial of His death, ‘‘took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves.”—Luke 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “datary” of the “pope” knows that the people of the Roman Catholic church are taught to study the wounds of Christ but are not taught, as the Scriptures state they should be, to &quot;study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”.-—2 Timothy 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “chancellor” knows that it is the teaching of the Roman Catholic church that Christ is still dying, whereas the Scriptures show that “Christ, being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him”.— Romans 6:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “patriarchs” know that if the Roman Catholic church could have its w ay in the world it not only would forbid others to teach the Bible as they believe it, but would even forbid them to hold property; yet they know that the Scriptures teach that “where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty”.—2 Corinthians 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “archpriests” know that the Roman Catholic canon law requires that offending clergymen be imprisoned in a separate place from laymen, and yet they know that the Scriptures teach the law of absolute justice, that there shall be “one ordinance . . . for* you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.&quot;—Numbers 15:15,16.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Frightened by the Testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “camerlengo” of the “pope” knows that the Roman Catholic church seeks by every means in its power to acquire wealth, yet he knows that the Scriptures teach “Thou shalt not covet”.—Romans 7: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “chamberlains” of the “pope” know that the “pope” has the most elaborate and costly wardrobe in the world, yet they know that the Lord taught that “he that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none”.—Luke 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “vicar-general” knows that the Roman Catholic clergy have laid the burden of “purgatory” on the people and will not do one thing for the souls supposedly therein until they get the money for the masses which they require.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet he knows that Jesus said of certain ones that “they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves Avill not move them with one of their lingers”.—Matthew 23: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “pontifical secretary of state” knows that the officials of the Roman Catholic church live in palaces but encourage others to exist under the most distressing and terrible conditions imaginable. Yet he knows that Jesus taught that “all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law' and the prophets”.—Matthew 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “prefect of the ceremonial congregation” knows that the Roman Catholic church teaches that God’s kingdom can never come, but that present terrible conditions in the earth, with all their inequalities, will be perpetuated forever. Yet he knows that Jesus taught His disciples to pray, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”—Matthew 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our space is limited, but if we had room, we could go on and name all the officials in the Roman Catholic church and they would have to admit, when the facts were presented to them, that the teachings of their church are in direct conflict with the following additional scriptures and many others which could be named, had we the time and space to include them in the record.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Fearful of Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We come now to a spokesman for the Roman Catholic church, i.e., </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The Catholic Balletin, </span><span class="font7">Official Publication of the Province of St. Paul, Member of the National Catholic Welfare Council News Service and the Catholic Press Association, published every Saturday by the Catholic Bulletin Publishing Company : Editorial, Business and Subscription Departments: Chancery Building, 244 Dayton Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota. Telephone: Elkhurst 0800; Press, 408410 North Franklin Street; Eastern Representative, George J. Callahan, 240 Broadway, New York City. Bernard Vaughan, Managing Editor; William J. Conroy, Assistant Editor; Edward H. Becker, Business Manager.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We now wish our readers to see how badly official spokesmen of the church are frightened by the fact that Judge Rutherford, the world's ablest Bible expositor, used one of the broadcasting stations in their city to declare to the people the truth regarding the ‘'holy year”, which he did in his address April 23, 1933, on ‘'Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> was so alarmed that its loading article on the front page of its issue of April 29 was devoted to a two-column protest with scareheads two columns wide and nine type lines, three inches, deep. We reproduce this evidence of their fright, in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">HOLY YEAR IS RIDICULED IN KSTP RADIO PROGRAM ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ANOTHER INSULT COMING</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaker Who Affronted Catholics of the Northwest for Hour Last Sunday Will Be Heard Again Next Sunday, Despite Protests, Says Official.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">KU KLUX SPEECH WAS BROADCAST BY STATION’S MANAGER FEW YEARS AGO</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Radio listeners of the Northwest were shocked last Sunday morning by an ignorant anti-Catholie program broadcast from 9 to 10 o'clock by the National Battery Station KSTP, St. Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of the program was to cast ridicule and suspicion upon the most sacred religious sentiments of the Catholic people and to make a grotesque political burlesque of the Ex-tiaordmary Holy Year of Jubilee proclaimed by His Holiness, Pope Pius XI, in commemoration of the nineteenth centenaiy &gt;f the ciucifixion and death of Our Blessed Lord and Savior, Jesus Chiist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING USED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1’110 affront to the Catholic people of the community was aggravated by the station’s deceptive advance advertising of the program. Frequent announcements were made daily. The public was incited to listen on Sunday to an important address on the significance of the Holy Year, but in these announcements there was no intimation as to the real character of the broadcast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The speaker was introduced as one Judge Rutherford, whose mischievous activities are not unknown elsewhere but from whom this legion has been spared hitheito. Listeners were asked to write for copies of lus speech and otliei literature to “The Watch Tower,’’ Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PROTESTANTS AND JEV, S INSULTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rutherford made insulting inferences also to the distinguished Protestant and Jewish citizens who participated in the “Holy Hour” held at the Radio City Music Ilall, New York, on Sunday, April 2, in observance of the opening of the Holy Year. Six thousand persons, Catholies, Protestants and Jews were present on that occasion and the entire proceedings weie broadcast on the network of the National Broadcasting company, v.ith which chain Station KSTP is affiliated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE NEW YORK MASS MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At that meeting eminent speakers urged the country to follow the spiritual example of Tope Pius XI and the tempoial example of Piesidcnt Roosevelt tor the uprooting of bigotiy, the prevention of oppression, and the wholesome cooperation of citizens in daily life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His Eminence, Patrick Cardinal Hayes, former Governor Alfred E. Smith, Rabbi Alexander Lyons, and the Rev. Dr. S. Paikes Cadman, Congregational clergyman, were the speakers at that meeting. The arrangements for it were made by such nationally known figures as Morgan J. O’Brien, former judge of the New York Supicme Court; Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, president of the Columbia university; and Henry Morgenthau, philanthropist and formerly United States Ambassador to Turkey. These were the men whose motives were impugned and against whom lidiculous charges were made by Rutherford in his KSTP speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">STATION'S RESPONSIBLE OFFICEF.S</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Station KSTP is operated by the National Battery Broadcasting company, with studios in the St. Paul Hotel and the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis. It was established about five yeais ago, and is associated with the National Battery Company, manufacturers of automobile and other storage batteiies, 1704-172G Roblyn avenue, St. Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The officers of the broadcasting company as shown in the City Directory are: L. J. Shields, president, Dellwood, White Bear Lake; Stanley E. Hubbard, vice-president and general manager, who lives at the St. Paul Athletic club; F. M. Brown, secretary, 174 Montiose place; E. H. Church, treasurer, 2157 Fair mount avenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The officers of the battery company are Mr. Shields, president; G. P. Castner, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a</span><span class="font5"> ice-president, 235 Mount Curve boulevard; Mr. Brown, secretary; and E. F. Cary of Minneapolis, treasurer. Mr. Church also is comptroller for the battery company and is associated with Mr. Shields and Hubbard in another enterprise, the Western Radio Engineering Co.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CATHOLIC PROTESTS RECEIVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the broadcast of the Rutherford speech on Sunday, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> has been unable to get into communication with Stanley Hubbard, the general manager of KSTP, It was said at his office that he was not there and that he could not be reached elsewhere. A representative of this newspaper was referred for information to Kenneth M. Hance, assistant manager of the station. Mr. Hance said some Catholic jootests had been received but that no Protestants or Jews had complained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was announced last Sunday that Rutherford would make another speech next Sunday at 8 a.m. thiough the facilities of KSTP. Mr. Hance said that so far as he knew this arrangement would be adhered to. Whether the series would be extended he could not say, because &quot;all the arianooments had been made by Mr. Hubbard.” But Hubbard could not be leached for a statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">HUBBARD’S PAST RECORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This same Hubbard is no stranger to readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin.</span><span class="font5"> His notorious ‘‘$125 Cash in Advance” deal with the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan back m 19—7 lies immediately recalled after last Sunday's deplorable incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In July, 1927, Hubbard was the owner and director of a small radio station in Minneapolis, WAMD, with a studio in the Radisson Hotel. At this time, it will be remembered, the Klan as an organization had become a stench in the nostrils of the whole nation. Powerful newspapers in the East had long before published terrific exposures of its night-riding terrorism in the south, the flogging of women, tarring and feathering, lynching, the whole sorry story. The press associations spread the chronicle of shame to every city. The horrible Ku Klux Klan saturnalia in Indiana had ended and everywlieie decent men and women were trying to forget about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">BROADCASTS WIZARD’S SPEECH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But on July 22, 1927, II. W. Evans, then ‘‘imperial wizard” of the Ku Klux Klan, turned up in Minneapolis for a lecture at the Kenwood armory. Newspapers reported that GOO persons were present. A typical anti-Catholic harangue was delivered and this speech was broadcast by Hubbard's radio station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a letter to the editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font5"> a few days later, July 26, 1927, Hubbard indicated that he regarded the Ku Klux Klan broadcast as a legitimate business transaction and he offered no apology for it. His letter, in part, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘Your letter of the 25th with reference to our broadcast of the Dr. Evans’ talk last Friday evening received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ I was personally present during part of the broadcasting but heard nothing that could be construed as an attack on the Catholic religion or any other religion, in fact this station will not tolerate any attacks of any sort against anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">JUST A BUSINESS DEAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘The broadcast of this Klan meeting, which was held at the Kenwood armory, was a commercial con-tiact for which the station was paid the sum of $125.00 in cash prior to the broadcast, and before and after the broadcast the station announcement stated that the broadcast was a commercial program and the station assumed no responsibility for any statements made and that the broadcast was arranged and paid for by E. A. Puffer, Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, of Minneapolis, Minn., and also that the announcement of the name of the advertiser was made in accordance with the rules laid down by the Federal Radio commission.” Hubbard then went on to say that he was so friendly to the Catholic church that he would like ‘‘to sign up” one of the churches ‘‘in this section” for ‘‘broadcasting the Sunday morning mass,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was about a year after the Klan broadcast that Hubbard became associated with Mr. Shields and others of the National Battery company in the organization of Station KSTP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">COURT DECISION ON CHURCH ABUSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last December the District of Columbia Supreme Court declared in an important radio decision that the American doctrine of free speech may not be used as a cloak to permit the employment of the powerful instrument of broadcasting to misrepresent before the American people the tenets of a Church and its members. Offense to the religious susceptibilities of the people was mentioned specifically in the decision, which went farther in protecting the public from bigotry via radio than any previous opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The decision stands, since the United States Supiente Court in January refused to review it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The case was that in which the court upheld the Federal Radio commission in refusing to renew the broadcasting license of Station KGEF, owned and operated by the Rev. &quot;Bob” Shuler, Methodist clergyman of Los Angeles, who had made frequent bitter attacks on the Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[See our footnote on this on page 536.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Even That Was Not Enough</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even that was not enough, but on the editorial page the first and longest effort of the editor was again devoted to expressing the terror which fills his soul that the Catholic people of St. Paul should hear some pure truth over the radio from the lips of Judge Rutherford. We reproduce the editorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[From the Editorial Page]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“In vain will you found missions and build schools, if you are not able to wield the offensive and defensive weapons of a loyal Catholic Press.”—Pope Pius X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">NOTES AND COMMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What About KSTP?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This newspaper is not in the habit of minding other people’s business, and we do not try to find offense where none is intended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the cheap and contemptible affront to the Catholic people of the Northwest last Sunday by the National Battery Broadcasting company calls for some plain speech on the condition that exists in the management of Station KSTP, one of the state’s two most powerful radio outlets. We shall not shirk that duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What ails KSTP, to put the case as candidly and briefly as possible, is ignorance, unscrupulous commercialism, social irresponsibility, bad manners and, perhaps, bigotry. Nothing but these faults, it seems to us, can explain last Sunday's shocking incident or the past performances of the station’s general manager.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Six years appear to have taught this man nothing. He now sits behind a fine front of respectability, associated in the broadcasting enterprise with men of real social and business position in the city. But essentially he is the same shabby fellow who six years ago kissed the blood-soaked rags of the tattered Ku Klux-ism and sold himself with smug complacency to that unspeakable outfit for ”$125 Cash in Advance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">History repeats itself. Money again is behind last Sunday’s insult to the religious-minded people of this community. The manager of KSTP this time peddled the facilities of his station to an obscure mountebank who confessed that he couldn’t get a hearing on the great radio networks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This charlatan was permitted to pour out his idiocies for an hour’s time to the offense of Catholic susceptibilities. He misrepresented grotesquely the benign character of our beloved Holy Father. He defiled the sacred sentiments and hallowed associations of this Hol.v Year commemorating the nineteenth centenary of the Redemption of mankind. He defamed high-minded Protestant and Jewish gentlemen who joined vith Catholic fellow citizens in observing the opening of Holy Year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">KSTP’s radio public was decoyed into listening to this program on Sunday by a series of misleading announcements made from time to time before the day of the broadcast. All this was bad enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But to tell us, as one in authority at the station did, in effect, tell us, that there is more of the same coming next Sunday and that we can take it and like it, is, it strikes us, a piece of unmatched insolence.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">May 3, 1933. Editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin, </span><span class="font6">St. Paul. Minn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Siu:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You are responsible, I presume, for the double column and editorial appearing in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font6"> on April 29 last in which an assault is made upon Radio Slation KSTP and myself, and for that reason 1 am addressing you. If you are fair and honest, you will publish this letter in your paper and then make, of course, any comments that seem fitting. It will be published in some other publications, at any rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your attack upon Radio Station KSTP is uncalled for, unjust and intolerable. The radio station did nothing but join in a chain broadcast of’ a speech made by me and for which I am responsible. You intimate that the license of that radio station might be taken away for its offense against the Catholic organization. How inconsistent is your position! The Radio Station KSTP neither directly nor indirectly defamed any man, while your paper abuses and defames the radio management in general and myself in particular and your paper assumes that you are at liberty to do so without question and that you are beyond even criticism, much less censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Without warrant or excuse you call me a “charlatan” and a “mountebank”. Please take note that not one thing that I have ever written or spoken can be construed as being a prating in my own favor or making unwarranted pretensions. I am not a boastful pretender. You were evidently thinking of some of the prelates and “high dignitaries” in the Catholic church and evidently charged me with being a charlatan and a mountebank because of these dignitaries. Please apply the definition to the leaders of the Catholic organization from the pope to the smallest priest and see how well it fits them. In every statement I have made in radio speeches I have cited the Word of Jehovah Cod as authority and given Him credit therefor. I have never assumed personal wisdom of these matters. I believe God’s Word and stand by it most emphatically. Never have I prated in my favor, because I am serving God and not man, not even myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Personally I have nothing to say against the pope or against any priest, because I do not care to indulge in personalities. However, when these gentlemen pretend to be the sole spokesmen for the Lord and at the same time fail to teach the people what is in the Bible, then it is my right and privilege to call the attention of the people to what the Bible says. If the truth offends these men, then I am not responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most bigoted and intolerant institution under the sun is the Catholic church organization. With great swelling and boastful words it claims to speak with authority in the name of God and if any man dares to call attention to its wrongful application of the Scriptures he is denounced as a “mountebank” and a “charlatan’’. The purpose of such denunciation, of course, is to prejudice the people and hold them in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No man can interpret God’s Word. Jehovah God reserves that to Himself. No man by reason of his official position in any organization has more authority than anyone else to speak of and concerning the Word of Jehovah God; in fact, no one can understand it unless he loves and serves God. For a long while you clergymen have claimed that the Catholic church is the sole authority for the interpretation of the Word of God. but that claim is entirely false. You have kept the people in ignorance for a long while because you have asked them to take the word of Catholic prelates as final, and not the Word of Jehovah God. You will not be able to deceive the people much longer. Jehovah God’s judgment against your institution written long ago will soon be executed and that will disclose to all creation the “hiding place of lies” and remove the blinding veil that is east over the people.—Isa. 25:7; Isa. 28:17; Ezek. 34:1-10; Jer. 25:34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic church system has designated this a “holy year”, and that without authority. A year fully and completely devoted to unselfish service of Jehovah God and His kingdom would be a great and blessed thing for the people. That is not what is intended or expected by this year, so-called “holy year”, and no year can be made holy by the proclamation of any human creature. If it is an offense before men to call in question the authority of any other man to speak for God, then men have no liberties whatsoever. This is not offensive, however, to the Lord, and I shall continue, by His grace, to exercise my privilege. You may worship the pope, if you desire, but it is my privilege. to tell the people that only Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are entitled to be worshiped and that all blessings proceed from Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus, and not by and through any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you were fair and honest and tolerant, you would want the people to have the truth regardless of whether men are honored or not. What can it benefit the people to eulogize and honor men? The Word of God is true and it cannot be judged by the opinions of men, regardless of who those men are. The Catholic institution has done more than any other institution on earth to keep the people in ignorance concerning God’s Word of truth, and this ignorance of His Word exists among many of the officials or priests of that organization. If you honestly believe what I have said is wrong and you want to do your duty, then you would explain to the people wherein my statements are wrong. Personal abuse of me will accomplish no good. Your opinion of me is entirely immaterial. Your abuse only beclouds the issue and keeps the people in ignorance and they suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a person makes mention of the “high dignitaries” of the Catholic church in any manner except that of exaltation, he is guilty of a grave insult and offense in your opinion. You are entirely wrong in taking this position, and the people are beginning to see how wrong you are. You and your institution should not pretend to speak the word of God unless you arc willing to be guided by His Word. For instance, you speak of the pope as “his holiness” and as “holy father”. That is your privilege, to be sure, but you have no right to compel or attempt to compel those who believe in God’s Word to so speak of men, nor have you any reason to take offense when other men cannot honestly and conscientiously so speak of these “high dignitaries” in the Catholic system. I prefer to take the words of the Lord Jesus Christ as my guide rather than the words of imperfect men. Jesus Christ said, in Matthew 23:9, “And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” In your paper you denounce me because I said that the “holy hour” service exalted the names of men and pushed the name of God and Christ in a corner. You know that I spoke 1hc truth. That service gave credit to man for what would come to pass and what men could do, and not one word was spoken about the kingdom of God under Christ, which is the only means whereby the human race can be blessed. I prefer to honor Jehovah God and have His approval rather than to be an abomination in His sight. Like the Jewish hypocritical clergy whom Jesus denounced, you attempt to justify your actions before men, but I am trying to show the people that they should take the Lord’s Word as their guide, and not that of men. In this regard Jesus said, Luke 16:15, “And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” You would have the people believe that I am wrong and you are right because I stand by the words of the Lord and so state them, and you would deny the radio station the right to use its property because a man pays for the time and broadcasts God's Word of truth by the radio facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am of the opinion that the Radio Station KSTP is able to take care of itself, but I must say that your harsh and brutal criticism of that station and its management is a violation of common decency, to say the least of it. If it were within your power, you would deny the right of any station to broadcast anything and everything that does not exalt the Catholic system, but you must remember that the radio is God's invention and does not belong to the Catholic system or any other creatures. In times past the Catholic system has been able to throttle free speech, but God in His Word declares that the time has come when all shall know that He is Jehovah, and it is certain He will give the people an opportunity to learn that fact. Probably you will continue to stubbornly resist the truth that God is supreme and that His kingdom under Christ is the only means of blessing, and if you do so persist the Lord will teach you in a most emphatic way.—Ps. 83:1-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public press quotes the pope as authority for the statement that the present suffering of the people of the nations is due to their neglect of and unfaithfulness to the church and that God has sent this trouble as an affliction upon them because of their unfaithfulness. If he made that statement, it is a defamation of God’s holy name, because God's Word plainly says that the Devil is responsible for the woes now upon the peoples of earth. (Rev. 12:12) I am trying to call the attention of the people to the Bible, which you clergymen have entirely failed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When an institution parades under the name of God and Christ and holds itself out as speaking with divine authority, then it is the duty, right and privilege of every person to compare the claims of such an institution and its teachings with the Word of God and call the attention of the people to what the Word of God says, and then let the people determine for themselves whether they wish to follow men or be guided by God’s Word of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You claim that the Catholic institution speaks with divine authority and represents Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ. I deny that claim most emphatically. The people desire to know the truth and they have a right to hear the truth. Why does not the Catholic system come out in the open and defend its position before the people? If I have misapplied the Scriptures, then it is the privilege and duty of the clergymen to point out to the people wherein that application is wrong and what is the truth. No good can result to the people by abusing mon and calling them “mountebanks” and “charlatans”. The people are tired of abuse and palaver and they desire to hear that which will help them. Now as a great newspaper and a part of a tremendous organization claiming to guide the people in God's Word, I call upon you to do the people a real favor, and to that end I lay down for a public discussion and consideration the following proposition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Resolved,</span><span class="font6"> That the Holy Scriptures prove beyond doubt that the head of the papal church system and its many priests who act officially under its direction do not act by the authority of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and do not represent God and Christ on earth, but said Catholic institution is a part of this world and operates under the supervision of the god of this world, that is to say, Satan, the Devil, and that thereby the people are deceived and kept in ignorance of the truth, which truth is now vital for them to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic institution owns a tremendous amount of wealth and is hence amply able to employ a nationwide network of radio stations and use them in the proclamation of that which the people desire to hear. I therefore earnestly call upon you to request the pope to name his most desirable man in the United States to debate the above question or proposition. There are enough of good, plain, honest people in America who will back me up and pay for one-half the cost of such a radio broadcast, your institution paying for the other one-half. The above question or proposition to be debated, not with venom or vituperation, but upon condition that personalities will not be indulged in and that an honest endeavor will be made to place before the people the truth, that they may choose which way they want to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With all the power and strength financially and otherwise possessed by the Catholic institution you should certainly be able to find some desirable man to defend its position. The whole world is in dire distress. You claim that present institutions can pull it out of that dilemma. I insist that there is no remedy except God’s kingdom under Christ. There could be nothing more vital to the peoples of earth just now. Let us forget men and their exaltation or denunciation and get down to the real truth of God’s Word and find out what is for the general welfare of mankind. Let the Word of God, the Holy Scriptures, be the authority upon which we base our conclusion and let the people at large be the jury and each one determine for themselves what they want to believe and after dispassionately hearing and considering all the truth, choose to take their stand where their conscience dictates that they’ should go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Believe me, sir, this is very respectfully submitted,</span></p><img src="g_E_19330524_files/g_E_19330524-10.png" alt="" style="width:72pt;height:28pt;">
<p><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>What Will “The Bulletin” Do Now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would be nice for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin</span><span class="font7"> if it could run its paper in such a way that nobody but Catholics would ever get a chance to see it. Then it would perhaps never be confronted with what it will now have to face, i.e., the letter of Judge Rutherford which appears foregoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When an editor calls a man in public life a ‘■’charlatan&quot; and a “mountebank’’ he assumes a responsibility to his readers and to the public. With more than a hundred and forty million copies of his books in circulation Judge Rutherford would have no difficulty in establishing in any competent court that he has been libeled, but he is engaged in bigger and more important business than seeking legal redress from publishers of such a sheet as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bulletin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the parade which they have made of their abject terror of Judge Rutherford’s voice over the air, we wonder if the publishers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Bullet in</span><span class="font7"> will be small enough and mean enough and cowardly enough to fail to print his letter which we publish in this issue? And, frankly, we have to say that we believe that they will be just so small and mean and cowardly. Nevertheless, a copy of his letter goes to the ‘’pope’’, so that the pontiff at least will have a chance to see what kind of men or near-men have charge of his business in St. Paid province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, honestly, we do not see how even the “pope” himself could be coward enough to dodge the challenge which appears in the adjoining column. At any rate, we know that our own readers will see to it that this challenge is broadcast to the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Footnote for page</span><span class="font6"> 533</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Some lawyers on the bench arc afraid of the political power and boycotting methods of the Roman Catholic church. For an analysis of this decision of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia,</span><span class="font6"> specifically favoring that institution, see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Ago </span><span class="font6">No. 351. pagJs 329, 330.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For another instance in which another judge apparently went out of his way to do the same thing (and got his fingers burned good and plenty for so doing), see also No. 313, pages 803-810, and 329, pages 461-467. This case is still pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Training their parishioners to expect torture for hundreds of years, which torture ‘can be mitigated’ by cash payments to themselves, in exchange for influence with “Mary”, “Peter” or others, the dignitaries of the Roman church have great difficulty in meeting any critics of their teachings or methods in a manly, courageous manner. But there are times when bluster does not work.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Home Remedies </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J. E. Meyer, Botanist</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In Two Parts—Part 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Coughs and Colds</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N these days of coughs, colds and congestion of the lungs, I believe it is an opportune time to say something of a root which old settlers learned from the Indians as a remarkable treatment for pleurisy, irritation and catarrhal conditions of the lungs. This valuable root is known the world over as pleurisy root. Probably named after the ailment for which it was used so successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pleurisy root is quite common in the Middle States. It can be readily recognized from a distance by its numerous bright orange-red flowers. Pleurisy root is also called butterfly weed, and silk weed. Butterflies seem to like it. After the flowers, come the long, slender seed pods, which are filled with silky floss, to which the seeds are attached. When these burst open, the silky threads spread like a parachute and the seeds float in the air for quite a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many times I have roamed through the fields in the summer, when these beautiful orange-red flowers were in bloom, and watched the various colored butterflies as they flitted around them; and later in the fall I have taken the seed pods and scattered their contents to the wind, and watched them sail along, hoping that they would fall in fertile ground and spread so that we could gather this valuable root in the following years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pleurisy root is used as a tea or infusion to promote perspiration and expectoration in diseases of the respiratory system. It is also a tonic, diuretic and antispasmodic. Its chief use, however, is in bronchial and lung troubles, especially pleurisy.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Diarrhea, Dysentery, Bronchitis</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In our boyhood days we lads were fond of chewing the inner bark of the slippery elm tree, never dreaming of its medicinal value. Surely many of you have done the same. We called it slippery elm on account of its mucilaginous or slippery taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Slippery elm is demulcent, emollient and nutritive. An infusion or tea of this bark is of wonderful service in dysentery, diarrhea, bronchitis and irritation of all mucous surfaces, upon which it has a very soothing influence. It is absolutely harmless and may be given to children freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Slippery elm tea is made by placing a heaping teaspoonful of the elm in a cup of boiling water. Let it cool, and it is readv for use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Externally the infusion or tea has a tendency to soften and mollify hard tumors and shrinking or contracted sinews. Elm bark tea is especially valuable for rough and chapped hands and face. It leaves the skin soft and smooth. As a poultice there are few articles that can equal it for inflammations, boils and old ulcers, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If a pinch of golden seal is added to this infusion, it greatly improves its value, especially if the tea is taken internally or used to wash open wounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dropsy, Dyspepsia</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The red men of the American forests, the Indians were never at a loss to know which herbs were best to use for their ailment. They could treat their complaints with skill far surpassing that of some of the physicians of those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I shall tell you of a real Indian remedy ; it is wahoo. Our frontiersmen and investigators noticed that in numerous cases of illness the Indian medicine man would chant &quot;Wahoo! Wahoo! and then administer a tea of a bark collected by his squaw. The tea has been used so successfully that the white men soon secured the secret and used it among themselves. It is commonly known as wahoo bark by the medical profession, and highly recommended in dyspepsia, torpid liver, constipation, dropsy and rheumatism. It is an excellent tonic, laxative and alterative. It acts especially on the liver, and promotes a free flow of bile. It causes no nausea, and stimulates the liver freely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wahoo is a small shrub or bush, from five to ten feet high. The flow ers are dark purple, and the fruit is a crimson, five-celled capsule. These plants grow in many sections of the L<sup>T</sup>nited States, in the woods and thickets and in river bottoms, flowering in June. The bark of the roots is the part used medicinally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You should study these old Indian remedies ; they are wonderful, and they will save you many dollars in doctor bills and many hours of suffering. You can learn to locate these plants and gather them yourself, so that you will have them when you need them.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Epilepsy, Falling Sickness, Fits</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am going to tell you about blue vervain, a very common plant, with a tradition that goes back to antiquity. Blue vervain was held sacred by the ancient Greeks and Romans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a slender plant, three or four feet high, with but a few leaves and spikes of small lilacblue flowers. It grows along roadsides and in dry, grassy fields, flowering from June until September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Blue vervain has real medicinal virtues. It is an excellent bitter tonic, and has been extensively used as a cough remedy and in the treatment of the liver and spleen; but the greatest medicinal value of this plant lies in the fact that there are few plants its equal for the good effect it produces in the treatment of epilepsy, fits and falling sickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good household nervine can be made by taking one ounce each of blue vervain, blue scullcap, and boneset; mix them together and use a heaping teaspoonful to a cup of boiling water; let it stand until it cools, the same as you would make ordinary household tea. Drink the cupful during the day, a large mouthful at a time. The combination is entirely harmless. You will be pleased with results, provided you use strictly fresh, last season’s crop. All medicinal herbs, leaves, and flowers deteriorate very quickly; for that reason they should be gathered fresh each year.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Gas and Sour Stomach</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the older folk need no introduction to sweet flag, one of the most valuable of medicinal herbs. Some of you can remember when it was used extensively as a table condiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it is ready for harvesting, its leaves will produce a pleasant pungent flavor and fragrant odor when crushed. This is one of the best ways of distinguishing it from other flags that grow in the same sort of muck ground. The root, and not the leaves, is the part that is used medicinally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That authoritative book, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medica, </span><span class="font7">describes the virtues of this plant as follows: “Sweet Flag is stimulative, carminative, tonic and aromatic and of excellent service in dyspepsia, colic, chlorosis and certain fevers. It improves the flow of gastric juice and relieves gas and sour stomach. Taken regularly it often prevents the return of intermittent fevers in marshy regions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Women who are afflicted with backache and cramp-like pains report quick relief and wonderful benefits from the sweet flag tea; and it is so easy to make. Here is the formula: Take </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2 </span><span class="font7">ounces sweet flag, 1 ounce black cohosh, 1 ounce sassafras bark; mix these together; then take one heaping teaspoonful of this mixture and place in a cup of water, bring to the boiling point, let it cool, and drink the cupful during the day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Irish Moss for Goiter</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many have requested an herb for goiter. Of a large number of plants containing organic iodine, there is one botanic that stands out most important. This is Irish moss, also called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chon-drus crispus.</span><span class="font7"> Irish moss is rich in organic minerals, and especially iodine. Iodine has a decided influence on the human organism in health and disease. Most of us have a deficiency of iodine in our system on account of our refined and denatured foods and lack of green vegetables. The average person consumes too much starch, sugar, fat and albuminous food, which causes fermentation and extremely poisonous substances and ultimately results in goiter, feeble-mindedness, epilepsy, stunted growth and incomplete development of the teeth and bone tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To cure, as well as prevent, the ailments resulting from iodine insufficiency, a diet rich in iodine-carrying foods is the sensible remedy. 'Natural brain stimulation, normal growth of body and mind, and perfect assimilation of calcium (lime), fluorin, silicon and chlorin is dependent on the organic iodine contained in the thyroid secretion. This fluid is not only a powerful antiseptic and germicide, but a natural tonic to brain and other tissue. Iodine is indispensable for healthy hair growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human system requires only a small amount of iodine, but this small amount it must have. Irish moss contains organic iodine in a form that is easily and quickly assimilated. Irish moss has been used for ages in the treatment of goiter. It is absolutely harmless and may be given to children freely; however, its taste is its only objection. It has a rather salty-water taste, which can be overcome with various flavors. Beef broth and soups blend well with it. Probably the best way to use it is to place a teaspoonful in a plate of soup, broth or milk. If boiled, it becomes a thick jelly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Irish moss grows on the submerged rocks in the sea. It is washed, dried in the sun, and shipped to the market in bales.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Influenza, Colds</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Boneset grows only in the temperate regions of our own Eastern and Middle States and was found in early Colonial days in every well-regulated household. Like hundreds of other remedies of every kind, it was a secret imparted by the Indians to the white race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a hitter tonic, its value was quickly recognized by members of the American medical profession of those early times who have continued to praise it to the present day. Long before any list of approved medicinal herbs was published in this country, Eupatorium, or boneset, or thoroughwort, was a favorite remedy for colds, influenza and intermittent fevers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The action of boneset is very similar to that of quinine, and there are a great many herb practitioners who consider it far better than quinine in certain cases where prolonged treatment is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The celebrated botanical explorer Pursh tells of the benefits derived from this herb by himself and others during a stay in the neighborhood of Lake Ontario when both influenza and lake fever were raging among the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When you are again troubled with a cold and fever try boneset tea. But remember, it must be fresh, last season's crop. Boneset tea has broken many cases of fever over night. Taken hot, boneset tea acts as a diaphoretic; taken cold, its action is tonic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Boneset tea is made by placing a heaping teaspoonful of the boneset leaves in a cup of boiling water, and allowing it to cool. Then you drink the tea during the day and at bedtime, a large mouthful at a time. It can do no harm.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>Kidney and Stomach Troubles</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Europe, the gathering of medicinal herbs is not only a time-honored custom, but an actual part of domestic science. The word ‘’science'’ could not be taken literally in early days. There was no exact knowledge of the active principles of different plants and herbs, but there was traditional experience, empyrical, as we call it today, that taught them which herbs are good for certain ailments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The juniper berry was one of the old favorites. It grows on rocky slopes and hills and on the edges of the woods. This well-known evergreen, the juniper, was always highly esteemed by the Europeans for its balsamic scent. They used the berries as an incense, placing a handful of them on a warm stove, which tilled the room with a fragrance that was not only very pleasing, but also purified the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Modern chemistry gives us an exact analysis of what the juniper berry contains, and we readily admit that their favoritism toward the juniper berry is very well founded. This small, seemingly insignificant berry has a wonderful combination of active principles not found in any other plant. It is, beyond question, an exceedingly powerful remedy for ailing kidneys. It is the same aromatic oil that evaporates into the air when placed on the stove that gives the juniper berry its effectiveness and healing qualities. This oil is so active that it must be used in very small quantities. The oil of the berry is recommended and must not be confused with juniper wood oil, which is altogether unfit for internal use. The juniper berry oil is quite expensive, but very little of it is necessary to relieve congestion of the kidneys, due to its great potency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to giving relief in kidney troubles juniper berry oil tones up the entire system. It is an excellent stomach tonic, increases the flow of urine, reduces the irritation of the bladder and relieves kidney pains. The action of the kidneys, especially, is greatly stimulated by the use of juniper berry oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the oil of juniper berry is so valuable in kidney troubles, I must not neglect to say a few words about the whole juniper berry itself. These berries are often eaten three to six at a time for gas and bloated stomach. These berries are also used to improve the appetite. They have a pleasant, sweetish, balsamic taste and odor and are agreeable to the weakest stomach. It is from the juniper berries that the best gin is distilled. A wholesome wine is also made from the berries. Many people place a handful of the berries in a gallon of any kind of wine for a few weeks, strain, and they then have a fine kidney and stomach tonic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good remedy for the common ailments, backache, persistent headache, dizziness and loss of appetite, is made by taking one ounce of juniper berries, ground fine, pour over them one quart of boiling water (do not boil), let stand until cool, and drink a teacupful after meals, and before retiring.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>For a Sluggish Liver</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To satisfy the large number of requests for a liver remedy, here is a formula that will clean out the liver and spleen, and is especially recommended to the elderly afflicted with a sluggish liver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are just four ingredients in this formula, and they are mandrake root, black root, sacred bark, and colic root. Take one ounce of each of these and mix them up; then take a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture to a cup of boiling hot water. Boil it for one minute, strain, and allow to cool. Drink the cupful during the day, a large mouthful at a time. Avoid eating oranges or any other citrus fruit for a day or two after taking this tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One or two days' treatment is about all that is necessary. This tea removes engorgement and all noxious bilious matter, promotes secretion of healthy bile and stimulates and tones up the liver and spleen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All four botanies mentioned are old Indian remedies and have been known for their value in liver congestion for centuries. Most liver remedies contain one or more of these ingredients. It is a good plan to clean out the liver occasionally. You would not think of living in a home without giving it a thorough cleaning once in a while; then why keep on living in a body that is filled with filth due to a sluggish liver ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do not expect this tea to taste good; it doesn't. In fact, it is quite bitter; but it can be sweetened with licorice root. If you object to an acrid, bitter medicine just add licorice root to this tea, just as much as you like. Licorice root is absolutely harmless and should be added to any herb tea that is disagreeable to the taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lumbago</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Queen of the meadow has been used for lumbago for centuries, and it is a wonder to me that it is not more universally used. It probably fell into disuse on account of losing its virtues after it is a year old. Queen of the meadow purchased from a store is usually two to live years old, and therefore worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is what Dr. John M. Schudder, in his book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medico,</span><span class="font7"> has to say of the virtues of this plant: “Queen of the Meadow Root. There is no doubt that this plant exerts a specific influence on the kidneys, increasing the quantity of the secretions and to some degree the solids in it. It has been successfully employed in atonic dropsies, chronic nephritis, chronic irritation of the bladder with increased mucous secretions, female weakness, rheumatism and gout.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Weak Lungs</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not many have any idea of the great fund of knowledge on this subject that has been gained by our Indian friends, handed down from one generation to another through many centuries. No wonder white physicians are so rarely called upon to treat and care for a sick Indian; for these original Americans rely today upon medicines used among them long before white settlers followed Columbus to America, remedies made from roots and herbs, furnished by Nature herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been my life work to investigate by direct personal study and inquiry to compare and to learn the best and most efficient of the herbs and roots used by more than a score of Indian medicine men whose friendship and confidence I have won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For years I have been known as the Medicine Man. Again and again I have been called to the aid of somebody who was sick when miles away from any help or human habitation, and invariably my advice on roots and herbs gave prompt relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one of my trips along the Rio Grande in Texas, in the region now known as Magic Valley, I met a young man from the north suffering from weak lungs. During the course of our conversation I recommended coltsfoot tea as an expectorant to relieve him of the terrible coughing spells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Months later from Arizona came a letter thanking me and speaking of coltsfoot tea in most grateful terms. He declared that after continuing the treatment for a few months he found himself entirely free from his old lung trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I could tell you much more about coltsfoot leaves and the amazing results that follow its use in cases of bronchitis, asthma, difficult breathing, congestion, coughs, colds, etc., but space here is limited.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Nervine and Stimulant</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few months ago I was honored by a visit from a native doctor from Liberia, Africa. During the few hours of our conversation I learned many strange and interesting things. The doctor was highly elated and much surprised when he saw some of his native drugs in our bins. It was the first time he ever saw such a large collection of botanic drugs from foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the articles that attracted his attention were the sweet kola nuts. He explained that many thousands of pounds of these were shipped to this country for use in a widely advertised beverage which, however, contains only a small quantity of the medicinal virtues of the nut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In his native land kola nuts are a very important household medicine. Every mature man or woman eats one kola nut each morning before any other food is taken. They would not think of eating breakfast or even take a drink of water before first partaking of the kola nut to purify and strengthen the system for the day's toil, He advises Americans to consume one or two teaspoonfuls of the powdered dried sweet kola nuts before breakfast, sprinkled with a little salt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medica</span><span class="font7"> states that kola nuts are stimulant, tonic, nervine, diuretic and astringent, and useful in aiding endurance of fatigue without food and as a remedy for neuralgia, headaches, migraine, indigestion, diarrhea and weak and irregular heart. This is another indication that the natives of so-called uncivilized nations have it all over us in the use of Nature’s great household remedies—roots and herbs. Kola nuts are harmless and almost tasteless.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Nervous Troubles</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Black cohosh is another of the wonderful secrets conveyed to us by the Indian medicine man, and it is used by physicians to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You will not find this plant described or even mentioned in any old books on botany published in England or any other country, prior to the seventeenth century. It is strictly an American Indian plant. The Indians brewed a tea of equal parts of black cohosh, sacred bark, and Canada snake root as a medicine for cramps, lumbago, rheumatism, gout, neuralgia, nervous headaches, nervous prostration and many other nervous afflictions of the female organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A committee of the American Medical Association, headed by Dr. N. S. Davis, in the year 1848 made a most favorable report on the action of black cohosh. They say they have found black cohosh to lessen the frequency and force of the pulse, to soothe pain and allay irritability ; in other words, they held black cohosh to be the most purely sedative agent we possess, producing its impression chiefly on the nervous system of organic life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another doctor writing on the virtues of black cohosh in cases of rheumatism and  neuralgia states that the more acute the disease, the more prompt and decided will be the action of black cohosh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Black cohosh is one of the beautiful plants of our forests, growing close to the edges of the forests and occasionally in the deep woods. Its flowers are a white feathery plume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A teaspoonful of the root to a cup of boiling water is the correct dose. Drink the cupful of tea during the day, a large mouthful at a time. If this tea is made too strong it may cause headache to some. However, one teaspoonful to a cup of water is absolutely harmless.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>Obesity</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A remedy used for ages for making fat people thin is undoubtedly the most harmless of all treatments for obesity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The plant is very similar to Irish moss. The name of the plant is sea wrack, also sometimes called gulf wrack and bladder wrack. This sea weed grows upon muddy rocks under the sea. It is usually of a black or very dark brown color. It is washed, dried in the sun and shipped to the market in bales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sea wrack has been the most important ingredient in the majority of obesity treatments and, undoubtedly, was also the most harmless ingredient. It has often been sold at fancy prices, all out of proportion to its cost. Five to ten dollars has been charged for not more than 2ac worth of sea wrack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The average dose of sea wrack is one teaspoonful 3 times a day. It may be taken in coffee or just as it is. Sea wrack is harmless, and as much may be taken as the stomach will hold; it has a disagreeable taste, a rather salty, fishy taste, and for that reason it is not very popular in its natural state. Sea wrack is rich in organic minerals, being used chiefly as a blood purifier and in the treatment of obesity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am satisfied that sea wrack is the most efficacious and harmless of all remedies for obesity, but it will not affect every person in the same way.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>For Mouth, Throat and Voice</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Life everlasting is found in Canada and various parts of the United States, growing in old fields and on dry barren lands, flowering in July and August. Life everlasting herb is also called field balsam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Life everlasting is an astringent and slightly bitter tonic. Ulcerations of the mouth and throat are relieved by chewing the leaves and blossoms, and if used in the same manner makes an excellent substitute for the tobacco-chewing habit. It has a slightly bitter balsamic flavor that is pleasing to most tastes. Some mix it half and half with shredded licorice root; this sweetens and improves the taste. In quinsy, fevers and pulmonary and bronchial complaints, a warm infusion is found to be very beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The infusion is very simple to make; just steep a heaping teaspoonful of the herb in a cup of boiling water. Drink one or two cupfuls during the day. All herb teas are made in this simple way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Life everlasting herb is also used as a voice tonic. This simple old Indian remedy consists of chewing the dried herb the same as one would tobacco, but swallowing the juice. The Indian medicine men always carried so much of this fragrant herb with them, that it gave them a peculiar, yet not unpleasant scent, similar to the odor of hickory nuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Life everlasting was much used by the Indian orator. It clears the voice in a most remarkable manner, and it is said to create a desire to sing. Singers and speakers should try this. It will surprise and delight them. It is excellent for hoarseness, sore throat and certain affections of the mouth. This herb loses its medicinal virtue very quickly. Use only strictly fresh, last season’s crop.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>Piles, Rupture, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now about the value of the bark of a tree familiar to all, white oak. The bark of red oak and of black oak has similar virtues, but the white oak is preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Like many other good remedies coming down to us from our forefathers, this remedy has fallen into disuse, but it is far more valuable than the expensive drugs that have taken its place. White oak bark is a powerful astringent, tonic and hamiostatic, and absolutely harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In ulcerations of the mouth and throat, soft and spongy gums, it is a good cleanser, healer and sweetener. It may be used freely as a wash for sores and ulcers. In rectal relaxation and piles it is used internally as a tea in small doses and also used locally. An infusion of white oak bark is often of service in ruptures, as it has a tendency to tighten the muscles. For this purpose it must be made very strong, about an ounce of the bark is placed in a pint of water and boiled down to measure two ounces. For internal use one teaspoonful is used to a cupful of boiling water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many years ago it was a custom to bathe scrofulous and weakly babies in a tea of white oak bark. White oak sponge baths are good for night sweats. White oak poultices are used in cases of gangrene and relaxed old sores, and white oak tea in unhealthy discharges from mucous surfaces anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An infusion or tea of white oak bark and fennel seed in equal parts makes an excellent combination for all purposes I mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>Pimples and Eruptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The secret of the splendid health of the average Indian lies in their remarkable knowledge of the curative and healing powers of hundreds of natural herbs and roots, and the organic minerals and vitamins which these contain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I will tell you of a little experience I had on one of my exploring trips in northern Wisconsin. I have a passion for treading through the woods and fields, digging up roots, and studying the medicinal value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was attracted by a rather stylish party of city folks who had stopped at an Indian medicine man's lodge. A young man of the party was afflicted with an eruption or rash that appeared to cover his whole body. He was a terrible sight. As I knew this Indian well, I moved on, satisfied that he would eventually cure him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About ten days later, on my return trip, I found the young man still visiting the lodge, but his appearance was a big surprise to me. His swollen, pimply face and eyelids were now clear and pink. All trace of eruption had vanished. He left shortly after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only remedy the Indian medicine man used on this case was the leaves and twigs of sweet fern; these he brewed into a strong tea and gave it to the lad internally. He also bathed the afflicted parts with the tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sweet fern is a pretty little shrub growing on the outskirts of the woods, and you should learn to know it. The leaves when bruised have a pleasant aromatic odor, which is dissipated with age. Only last season's crop of leaves should be used.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Rheumatism and Lumbago</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is about a little plant that has cured so many cases of rheumatism and lumbago, and so many other ailments, that it is almost unbelievable that one single botanic could be so useful. I have seen cases of rheumatism and lumbago of the worst kind cured by this herb simple. I have numerous testimonies of the value of this little plant in cases of dyspepsia, constipation, fevers, liver troubles, prostatic trouble, and many other ailments. However, it appears to be of greater value in cases of rheumatism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The  </span><span class="font7">little botanical aid to man is known as Virginia snake root, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">serpentaria.</span><span class="font7"> It is a neat </span><span class="font6">little </span><span class="font7">vine of our woodland, growing barely a </span><span class="font6">foot </span><span class="font7">high. The root is the part used. It has a </span><span class="font6">very bitter </span><span class="font7">resinous taste, and the odor of the bruised root is similar to fresh varnish. It has been known for centuries to old herbalists and to our Indian medicine men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Materia Medico</span><span class="font7"> and books on medical botany describe the virtues of this plant as follows : Virginia Snake Root is stimulant, tonic, diaphoretic, diuretic, emmenagogue, aphrodisiac, promotes appetite and digestion, increases bronchial and intestinal secretions, heart action, and produces mental exhilaration. It is very valuable in intermittents, typhoid, pneumonia, diphtheria, rheumatism and dyspepsia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The medicine is very simple to make: Place a heaping teaspoonful of the granulated or powdered root in a glass container, pour in boiling hot water, allow to stand until it cools, strain, and drink a cupful during the day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>Sleeplessness</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">News about a simple herb tea for insomnia or sleeplessness a great many nervous persons will welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is a simple, harmless herb formula that I am sure will please you. The formula contains only three different herbs: they are blue scullcap, catnip, and peppermint. You merely mix equal parts of these together and then use one or two heaping teaspoonfuls of the mixture to a cupful of boiling water, and allow it to remain until lukewarm. Drink the cupful warm upon retiring at night and you will not be bothered with loss of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The catnip and peppermint plants are known to all and require no description. Blue scullcap, however, may not be as well known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Blue scullcap grows about three feet high and has a square branching stem. The flowers are of a pale blue color. It grows in moist places, in ditches, and along the sides of ponds. The whole plant has medicinal virtue. It should be gathered while in bloom and hung up to dry in the shade; then it is to be packed in air-tight containers, as it loses its strength and medicinal virtues very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Scullcap is a valuable nervine, tonic and antispasmodic, useful in convulsions, fits, delirium tremens and many nervous affections. It supports the nerves, quiets and strengthens the nervous system.</span></p>
