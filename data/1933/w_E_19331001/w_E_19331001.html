<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all tilings; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and- authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>MELCHIZEDEK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire.”—Ps. 104:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH used a man to picture his great High Priest and the righteous Ruler of the world, and the name of that man was Melehizedek. He filled the twofold office of priest and king, and concerning him God caused Moses to write: “And Melehizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; and he was the priest of the most high God.” (Gen. 14:18) From the time of Abraham forward, men devoted to God have looked for the coming of the Greater Mel-chizedek. There is no record of his beginning or ending, nor of his father or mother, because there was none before him and he has no successor in office. Melehizedek pictured the offices filled by Christ Jesus. He was a type of Christ Jesus. “For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, . . . first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.”—Heb. 7:1-3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth, anointed him to the high office of King and Priest, raised him up out of death, exalted him above all creation, and clothed him with all power in heaven and in earth, and placed him in a position in heaven where he must remain until God’s due time to send him forth to rule. That due time eame in A.D. 1914 and Jehovah then installed his King and great High Priest in office and sent him forth out of Zion to rule amidst his enemies. Of and concerning him Jehovah said: “The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melehizedek.”—Ps. 110:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Jesus Christ, the Anointed One, near the end of his earthly ministry rode into Jerusalem on a young ass, and this was just three and one-half years after his anointing; and he was then and there presented to the Jews as their King and then straightway appeared at the temple and cleansed it. (Matt. 21:1-12) Just three and one-half years after he was installed as King, to wit, in the spring of 1918, Christ Jesus was presented to “Christendom” and all others as the world’s rightful and righteous King, and then straightway he appeared at the temple of Jehovah for judgment and cleansing of the temple class. It was then that Jehovah laid Christ Jesus as the chief corner and head stone of his royal palace. Then followed his inspection of the earth, particularly of “Christendom” and of his faithful followers, and that was the beginning of the preparation for the battle of the great day of God Almighty.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> Concerning this great Melehizedek Zechariah prophesied at the direction of Jehovah and said: “Rejoice greatly, 0 daughter of Zion; shout, 0 daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thie; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.”— Zech. 9:9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Zechariah’s prophecy, which discloses the doom of Satan's organization, could not be understood by men on the earth until the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple for judgment. Those who have rejected Christ Jesus as King, to be sure, will not understand this prophecy now. Those who rejected the published evidence concerning “the birth of the nation”, meaning the beginning of the kingdom, have never discerned the Lord at the temple of Jehovah. The time of understanding and appreciating the prophecy set forth in this chapter is definitely located as being after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and when the faithful remnant are brought to the temple and anointed. This is conclusively proved by the words of the ninth verse just above quoted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“ The remnant, found faithful at the time of judgment, brought into the temple and anointed, are the ones who were called upon to greatly rejoice and who do rejoice. (Isa. 61:10) These are the ‘daughters of Zion’, because they are children of God’s woman, that is, his organization. Thereafter others as they hear and appreciate the fact that the Lord is in his holy temple may also rejoice exceedingly. The daughters of Zion described in this prophecy are made members of God’s organization, and hence a part of the royal priesthood, and are taught of God. (Isa. 54:13) Jehovah had installed his King upon his throne, the kingdom was born, and now he sends his King to his faithful children. (Rev. 12:5; Matt. 21:1-12; John 12:12-16; Ps. 118:22-26) The miniature fulfilment of this prophecy was when Jesus rode into Jerusalem</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">on the ass; and the complete fulfilment thereof began in 1918, and the judgment continues until the real temple is cleansed. In the performance of this work it is written of the great Judge: ‘He is just, and the great Vindicator of Jehovah’s name.’—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Describing the riding of Jesus into Jerusalem, both Matthew and John quote a part of this prophecy of Zechariah 9:9, but they both omit these words: “He is just, and having salvation.’’ (Matt. 21:4,5; John 12:14,15) Other translators render this text as, “Righteous and victorious is he.’’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Leaser)</span><span class="font3"> “Vindicated and victorious is he.’’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> Manifestly these words were omitted by the apostles because the -time for judgment and vindication had not then come and that part of the prophecy must have its complete fulfilment after Christ Jesus is installed as King and Judge and at the time he is presented as King of the whole earth. Installed as King in 1914 he gained a victory over Satan, first casting him and his crowd out of heaven. In 1918 he is presented as King and is commissioned to judge the world and to vindicate Jehovah’s name; hence he continues onward, “conquering, and to conquer.’’—Rev, 6:2; 12:7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> At the time of the miniature fulfilment of the prophecy the people who beheld Jesus riding into the city cried out: “Hosanna!” meaning “Save, we beseech thee! ’ ’ Appropriately at the second fulfilment Jehovah’s anointed witnesses say: “Save now, we beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118: 25, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, now brings salvation and deliverance from Satan’s organization as well as redemption from sin and death, all of which is in vindication of Jehovah’s name. When he came to earth he came meek and lowly, subjecting himself to Jehovah’s hand, and was therefore favored by the Most High. (Prov. 3:34) Now he comes to his temple and offers himself to the peoples of earth as their King and Judge, and this he does through his message delivered by his lowly feet members, the remnant, Jehovah's witnesses on earth. He rode upon an ass, evidently to identify himself as the Messiah, the anointed King. (1 Ki. 1: 32-39) He is pictured as “riding upon . . . a colt, a young ass” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.),</span><span class="font3"> that is to say, a fresh, new mount, on which no one else had ever ridden. As Anointed King of God he had no predecessor in office and will never have a successor. (Heb. 7:3) Jehovah’s anointed remnant now behold the mighty King, “high and lifted up,” at his temple, and they greatly rejoice, as both Zechariah and Isaiah prophesied.—Isa. 6:1-3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">’ Christ Jesus comes in peace, bringing great joy to those who love his appearing. Then he begins the work of preparing his body members on earth and giving attention to the things pertaining to the coming battle of the great day which will vindicate his Father’s name. “And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace unto the heathen; and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.” (Zech. 9:10) In this prophecy Ephraim represented the ten tribes of Israel, while the interests of the other tribes centered in Judah. The cutting off of the horse and battle bow, as stated in the prophecy, shows the Lord establishing peace and unity between all of his organization, with one King thereof. (Ezek. 37:16-23; Ps. 133) Christ the great warrior will whip the nations at Armageddon and thus compel them to be peaceable. “Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.” (Ps. 46:8,9) “And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isa. 2:4) ‘And his dominion shall extend from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth,’ and he shall control everything formerly under Satan’s rule. (Ps. 72:8; Dan. 7:14,27; Gen. 15:18-21) As Jehovah’s great King and High Priest he will rule the whole world in righteousness, and as Prince of Peace he will establish peace on earth and good will toward men.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> The prophecy of verse nine is not addressed to the Jews, but is addressed to those who are of God’s organization and who welcome the coming of the King at the time he is presented at the temple. Also the prophecy of verse eleven is addressed to the same class: “As for thee also, by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Leaser,</span><span class="font3"> because of] the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisonei-s out of the pit wherein is no water.” (Zech. 9:11) God’s faithful people for a long while were held as prisoners by Satan’s organization. The blood of Christ Jesus solemnized the covenant by sacrifice and guarantees the deliverance of those in the covenant who continue faithful to God and against Satan’s organization. The faithful ones Christ Jesus has already delivered from Satan’s organization. (Isa. 45:13) This was done after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. Satan’s organization still holds the “great multitude” as prisoners, but the Lord in due time will bring them out of the prison houses. (Ps. 68:6; 69: 33; Isa. 42: 6, 7) Zechariah’s prophecy here states that these prisoners are brought out of the pit wherein there is no water, that is to say, no truth. “Christendom,” which is a part of Satan’s organization and where the faithful were held, has hewed out cisterns of its own which are dry and wherein there is no truth, like that in which Jeremiah was imprisoned. (Jer. 38:6-13) There is no water of truth in Babylon, and the prison keepers of that wicked organization diligently endeavor to keep Jehovah’s witnesses from reaching the “great multitude” that are prisoners there and bringing to them the message of truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Those in the covenant for the kingdom and who were faithful up to the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple are first delivered from captivity, being brought out from Satan’s organization, and then these, as Jehovah’s witnesses, must bear the message of truth to the “great multitude” who continue in Babylon as prisoners. Jehovah caused Zechariah to prophesy: “Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare that I will render double unto thee.” (Zech. 9:12) This verse of the prophecy involves both the faithful remnant and the “tribulation” class. According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> the text is rendered: “Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; even to-day do I declare, Double will I return to thee!” Jehovah there declares by his King and Judge, Christ Jesus, now come to the temple, that he (Jehovah) will render or return double unto “the strong hold”, that is to say, those who are of the faithful remnant class and who are brought into the temple. God’s capital organization is the great strong hold of his organization. The “great company” class also agreed to do God’s will and have been begotten by his spirit, and now these prisoners in Babylon, in order to live, must return unto God’s organization. This the “great multitude” will do when they take their stand on the side of Jehovah and hail Christ as King, and this is shown by The Revelation as being done by them in bearing palms in their hands and wavingithem before the King. (Rev. 7:9; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light, </span><span class="font3">Book One, page 93) At the present time they are “prisoners of hope” because they still hope to be with the Lord. (Rom. 8: 24) This hope is expressed by the “great multitude” when they pray the prayer that is set forth by the psalmist: “Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name. ’ ’—Ps. 142: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> The following part of the prophecy, to wit, “Even today [or ‘that day’] do I declare that I will render double unto thee,” applies specifically to the faithful remnant. “That day” or time began with the reign of Christ Jesus, and, as to the remnant, it begins or relates to 1919, when they were, by the Lord’s grace, delivered from Satan’s organization. The “great multitude” continues in the custody of Babylon’s jailers; but to the approved ones who are brought into the temple at judgment Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple class, now says: ‘Even this day I declare I will render [return, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.] </span><span class="font3">a double unto thee.’ The Hebrew here rendered “double” means “twice as much”. (Ex. 16:22; Job 42:10) The facts in support of the prophecy show that after 1919 Jehovah gave to his faithful remnant, which constitutes the Elisha class, “a double portion of [Elijah’s] spirit.” (2 Ki. 2:9) The facts and these scriptures definitely fix this part of the prophecy as applying to the faithful remnant as the ones receiving the double. After Job had been subjected to the test and had been approved he was given twice as much as he had before, which is an illustration of the same point. (Job 42:10) In like manner those who had been faithful during the Elijah work and who, when put to the test at judgment, were declared faithful under the test, and who had thus maintained their integrity, these constitute the class, that is to say, the remnant, which is given twice as much; hence Jehovah causes his favor which had been taken away for a time to “return” to the faithful ones. From 1918 to 1919 the favor of Jehovah was withdrawn, and afterwards returned, as shown by other prophecies. (Isa. 12:1) Jehovah has given his faithful remnant twice as much truth since that return of favor, and they have done a far greater work by carrying that truth to the people. A comparison of the publications bearing the message of truth during the Elijah work with those of the Elisha period of the church is here quite interesting. The building up of the temple is preparing “the strong hold”. “When the Lord shall build up Zion [as a stronghold], he shall appear in his glory. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. . . . For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner, to loose those that are appointed to death; to declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem.” (Ps. 102:16-21) Having built up his stronghold, the Lord then calls to the “great multitude” class to return to his organization: “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.” (Joel 2:32) “But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions. ’ ’—Obad. 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> The “double” mentioned in verse twelve of this prophecy has no application to the punishment of the Jews, nor the return of God’s favor to the Jews. It is not a message of evil, but a message of good, meaning a double portion of good, applying exclusively to the temple class. According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lceser</span><span class="font3"> this part of the prophecy reads: “Even to-day do I declare, that I will recompense twofold (good) unto thee.” The marginal reading of the same rendering: “Even this day I announce to thee a twofold happy message.” It is quite clear that verse thirteen is really a part of verse twelve of the prophecy and fixes the time when this ‘double favor’ or ‘message of happiness and favor’ will be granted unto the remnant. “When [at the time that] I have bent Judah [as a bow or archer’s war instrument] for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, 0 Zion, against thy sons, 0 Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.” (9:13) According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> the text reads: “I have bent for me Judah, as a bow have I grasped Ephraim, thus will I rouse up thy sons, 0 Zion, against the sons of Greece, and will make thee as the swrnrd of a mighty one.” Jehovah here shows the preparation of his chosen ones for the great war.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Judah and Ephraim, as here used, stand for the united sons of Jehovah’s capital organization, because they are together called ‘the sons of Zion’. In this prophecy they picture the unity in Christ, for Jehovah’s work, of the entire twelve tribes as described in Revelation 7: 4-8. It is the time of unity mentioned by the apostle. (Eph. 4:13) These are prepared for war against Satan’s organization. The chief son of Zion is Christ Jesus, “the Lion of the tribe of Juda,” and the others praising Jehovah are with him in the war. In this prophecy Judah and Ephraim picture Christ and the faithful members of his body, to which Jehovah gives a double portion of his favor or spirit. These he raised up for his purposes. The great raising-up work began with the resurrection of the faithful sleeping saints, and later by bringing the remnant into unity with Christ Jesus, making them a part of the temple. It is the Christ united that is God’s war instrument and used by Jehovah for that purpose. “Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; . . . And I will render unto Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 51:20-24) Jehovah fills his bow (Judah) with Ephraim (as arrows) for war purposes. These sons of Zion Jehovah raises up and prepares for war against “Greece” and her “sons”. Here Greece and her sons stand for Satan’s organization, and particularly that part of it called “Christendom” or the seventh world power. At the time Zechariah’s prophecy was written Babylon had fallen, and Greece was soon to become the fifth world power. The Roman Empire and, later, the Anglo-American empire system were off-shoots of the Grecian Empire; hence the prophetic expression “the sons of Greece” pictures the instruments of Satan on earth at the end of the world, which instruments are, to wit, the seventh world power and all those nations that go to make up the League of Nations. The most important part of this organization is “Christendom”, the Anglo-American imperialism. (Dan. 8:21-23; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> June 15 to July 15, 1933) In this day Zion, which is God’s organization, is made “as the sword of a mighty man”. The enmity between the two seeds is now vividly portrayed as Jehovah foretold. (Gen. 3:15) It is in this day when Jehovah prepares his army for war that he may use it to punish Satan’s organization, and it is in “that [time or] day” that he renders a double portion of good unto his anointed ones.—Isa. 27:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The remnant now see the fulfilment of the prophecy that ‘Jehovah of hosts is over all of his great war organization’, to wit: “And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.” (Zech. 9:14) Henceforth Jehovah is the defender of his organization: “As birds flying, so will the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it, and passing over he will preserve it.” (Isa. 31: 5) Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s arrow or polished shaft. “And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me.” (Isa. 49:2) As the glorious and victorious Warrior of Jehovah he goes forth “as the lightning”, that is, with lightning speed, like Jehu, to war against the enemy. The lightning of Jehovah flashes from the temple, giving notice and warning of the early destruction that shall come upon the enemy. As Zechariah sajs: “The Lord God shall blow the trumpet,” that is, the seven trumpets he has sounded. The sounding of the trumpets means a time of woe to Satan’s organization and a time of joy to God’s organization on earth, as well as in heaven, and denotes that the great battle and its complete victory is near. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 100.) The “whirlwinds” mentioned by Zechariah show the swift moving of Jehovah’s organization with his host of warriors against Satan’s organization. (Ezek. 38:14,15; 39:2; Hab. 3:3; Isa. 21:1) Many scriptures strongly indicate that at least some of the faithful remnant will be on earth and see Armageddon while in the flesh. The following prophecy strongly supports that conclusion, to wit: “The Lord of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour [so shall they eat, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.],</span><span class="font3"> and subdue with sling stones [and trample underfoot sling-stones, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]; </span><span class="font3">and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine, and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.” (Zech. 9:15) Even at the present time the enemy hurls a shower of stones against God’s remnant, but these do not hinder them from pressing on joyfully doing their part of the work. The faithful trample underfoot these slingstones from the enemy and go on over them and continue to proclaim the praises of the Most High. Even now the faithful drink, not merely water, but the “fruit of the vine” of the kingdom of joy, which sustains them for the forward march. “Wine” symbolically here represents their gladness or joy of heart. (Ps. 104:15) Therefore the remnant “make a noise as through wine”, shouting with joy unto the Lord of hosts. (Isa. 12: 6) The prophetic statement that “they shall be filled like bowls” suggests that the remnant see the lifeblood of the enemy spilled and shall be satisfied. (Isa. 34:3,6,8) Bowls were used at the altar, in which to catch the blood. The feet of Christ shall be dipped in the blood of the enemy, says the prophet, symbolically saying that the feet members shall see the enemy perish.—Ps. 68: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah is the great Shepherd of his flock and, as such, he protects, shields and preserves them, and the flock find in him the high tower of safety. In harmony therewith Zechariah prophesies: ‘ ‘ And the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.” (Zech. 9:16) In the past Jehovah led his flock by the hand of Moses, and now he leads them by the hand of the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus. (Ps. 77:20) He gave his Word that he will save his flock and preserve them. (Ezck. 34:22; Ps. 95:7) With the remnant the chief doctrine is the kingdom because it is the kingdom that will vindicate Jehovah’s name. For this reason they lift high the standard of Jehovah and make the kingdom appear before the people as that which is most conspicuous. Jehovah lifts up his witnesses “as the stones of a crown”. It is Jehovah’s message that these faithful witnesses are holding forth, and this constitutes an ensign or guide to the people who desire righteousness. What a glaring insult to Jehovah for his witnesses to ask the Devil’s agents for permission to preach the gospel of the kingdom! Those who abide in the remnant or temple class will rely entirely upon Jehovah and obey his commandments given by the Greater Moses.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> While the preparation work is going on amongst God’s people preceding the great battle, the goodness and beauty of Jehovah God is made to appear to them: “For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.” (Zech. 9:17) Zion, which is God’s organization, is beautiful for situation, and out of Jehovah’s organization Jehovah’s beauty shines. (Ps. 48:2; 50:2) The King and High Priest who is the head of Zion is also beautiful. (Isa. 33:17; Ps. 45: 2,11) The faithful ones behold the Lord Jehovah and his great Judge at the temple and in glory and beauty. The “corn” (or grain bread) gives strength to the remnant; and the wine of joy makes glad the heart, and the joy of the Lord is the strength of all of the temple class. Some of these are called ‘ ‘ young men”, that is to say, strong in the Lord, that are given visions of the prophecies; and some arc “maids”, or virgins, that shall prophesy, because all of these have received the outpouring upon them of the spirit of the Lord. (Joel 2:28,29) The kingdom service makes glad their hearts and they see that Jehovah’s purpose is now to vindicate his name, and that he sustains the remnant and prepares them for the battle of the great day. They behold the beautiful King riding forth on his righteous war mount, and these faithful ones follow after him whithersoever he goes marching on to the war.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS BLESSINGS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The temple work progresses and will be completed when every living stone has hearkened unto the Greater Moses and proved his integrity towards Jehovah and abides permanently in the temple. Jehovah supplies all their needs. (Luke 11:13) To the remnant now working at the temple Jehovah says: “Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field. ’ ’ (Zech. 10:1) Rain is a symbol of God’s refreshing blessings which the remnant daily need. The latter rains came “in the first month”, or about April, our time. (Joel 2:23) They denote kingdom favors, and now Jehovah has bestowed his great favor upon the remnant: “In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.” (Prov. 16:15) Particularly since 1925 Jehovah has given his people a continual downpour of rain, greatly refreshing and blessing them. The “bright clouds” signify the presence of the Lord with his organization, and are giving them light and blessings. (Ps. 68: 9; Ezek. 34:26; Joel 2: 23) Everyone who works at the temple receives his abundant supply and is made to rest in the “green pastures”. (Ps. 23:2) These faithful ones bring ‘all their tithes into God’s storehouse’ and he opens the windows of heaven and pours out his blessings upon them. (Mal. 3:10) Jehovah God, by the hand of his Chief Shepherd, Christ Jesus, is feeding the temple class. None of the faithful remnant will permit themselves to be disturbed by the opposers who scoff at God and his provision for his own. The faithful will separate themselves from all opposers and continue in full unity to serve at the temple with gladness and with joy. Those at the temple are now being prepared and, when proved faithful, shall be for ever made a part of the Melchiz-edek priesthood, and hence instruments in the hands of Jehovah to perform the work and duties that lie has laid upon them. In all the ages to come they will be the special recipients of his grace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Now Jehovah gives his attention to the false shepherds or self-constituted teachers who follow their own way and therefore a lawless course, and this the Lord does that the remnant may be advised of such and avoid them. Hence Zechariah prophesied: “For the idols [R.F., teraphim; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Both.,</span><span class="font3"> household gods] have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams [the dreamers speak falsely, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin]; they comfort in vain; therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.”—Zech. 10:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Some have made to themselves household gods, such as the daily reading of a vow or morning resolve or twelve pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font3"> or a chapter in the Bible, inducing themselves to believe that by following such formality they are performing God’s service and that relying upon such they make themselves more holy than others, and this they do in the place or stead of receiving God’s rain or favor. Such vanities cannot produce rain, says the Lord. “But they are altogether brutish and foolish; the stock is a doctrine of vanities.” (Jer. 10:8) “Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or ean the heavens [Devil star-worshipers] give showers? art not thou he, 0 Lord our God? Therefore we will wait upon thee; for thou hast made all these things. ” (Jer. 14: 22&gt; “ The diviners’ ’ among God’s professed people, mentioned by the prophet Zechariah, are such as the “elected” elders and others of like position who think to receive God's approval by reason of their sanctimonious appearance and ‘fair-sounding speeches’, which they like to hear to tickle their own ears; such as attempt to draw followers after them and cause trouble amongst God’s covenant people who are diligently trying to obey his commandments and do his work. All the true and faithful witnesses of Jehovah will avoid all such ‘false teachers, diviners and dreamers’ who seek their own satisfaction and who have no real interest in the kingdom and hence do not joyfully serve it.—Rom. 16:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah is against such and advises the faithful remnant to stay out of th«-ir way. (Ezek. 13: 9) This the faithful must do in order to be cleansed and prepared for the Lord’s work and in order that they may ultimately be of the priesthood after the order of Melehizedek. No one can be prepared for temple service by associating with those who oppose the work that the Lord is now doing in the earth. God excludes these self-important ‘ diviners and tellers of dreams ’ from his organization, and the faithful should avoid them: “Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations; for I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 13: 23) As surely as Jehovah has an organization on the earth, just so surely he is feeding the members of that organization by the hand of Christ Jesus. The facts prove that he uses the Watch Tower publications to bring these truths to the attention of his remnant. It is therefore to be expected that the ‘diviners and dreamers’ will be against those who publish the truth, and that these evil ones will ridicule the faithful; and the facts show that that is exactly what they are doing. The Lord declares that darkness and confusion shall be the portion of such as make his people to err and as oppose his work. “Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.” (Mic. 3:6,7) These dreamers speak falsely and turn away from God’s Word of truth. (Jer. 23: 26-28, 32) Their efforts to comfort anyone are wholly in vain, and hence they are not performing any part of the commission given to God’s covenant people. Not having received the love of the truth, they go away from God’s flock and make up a flock of their own. They have been relying upon a man as their teacher and shepherd, and since his death they have no leader and are in trouble, and now they lament and say: ‘ ‘ There is no shepherd, and no more truth since he passed away.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The false shepherds also include the clergy, who make a pretense of representing the Lord, and include also the selfish “elective elders” who want the approval and praise of men, all of whom persist in their own wrongful way and in time end up in the ‘man of sin, the son of perdition’ class. Concerning such God caused Zechariah to prophesy: “Mine anger was [R.V., is] kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats [he-goats]; for the Lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.” (Zech. 10:3) Such billy goats are self-constituted leaders and principal ones of the flock, and these God declares he will punish. (Ezek. 34:17,18; Isa. 34:6) Jehovah visits his own flock and doubles his blessings to them during the Elisha period of the work because of their faithfulness in obedience to his commandments. God visits his own flock, and this he does as Jehovah of hosts to prepare his flock for war. Says the prophet: ‘The house of Judah the Lord hath made as his goodly horse in the battle’; and on this he rides to Armageddon. (Ps. 68: 32, 33) Likewise Jehovah’s organization, of which the remnant form a part, are belligerent, fired with zeal, are fearless and entirely subjected to the Lord, and this is because they have received from the Lord a double portion of the Elijah spirit. Now they are enlisted in ‘the armies which are in heaven’ and they follow Christ Jesus, who rides his righteous war mount, whithersoever he goeth.—Rev. 19:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The prophet now speaks specifically of Christ Jesus, the Head of Jehovah’s organization, who was sent forth to the temple as the Chief Corner Stone and then laid in 1918, and to whom is given the kingdom. “Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.” (Zech. 10:4) Christ Jesus is the Chief Corner Stone of Jehovah’s glorious palace, his capital organization. (Isa. 28:16) Christ Jesus, the Head of the house of Judah, is the “nail” upon which Jehovah hangs all the vessels of his organization. (1 Cor. 8:6; Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17) Jehovah's remnant on earth form “the feet of him”, Christ Jesus, and are like a nail which Satan now tries to destroy. “And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.” (Ezra 9:8) Christ Jesus is ‘fastened as a nail in a sure place’ to tl:e glory of his Father, and upon which nail shall hang all the glory of the royal house. The “man of sin” class, which was foreshadowed by Shebna, and which is the would-be “nail”, the Lord removes together with Satan for ever in the day of battle. (Isa. 22: 15-25) Christ Jesus is also “the battle bow” or war implement which Jehovah uses to smite the enemy. (Ps. 45:5) Jehu was a crack bowman and sent an arrow straight into the heart of the enemy, and thus he foreshadowed Christ, who will execute the enemies of Jehovah. (2 Ki. 9:24) “Every oppressor” is rendered, according to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font3"> “every one that driveth on together.” At Armageddon Christ and his army will harass, press upon and drive before linn the enemy under the leadership of Gog, and all the host of Satan's crowd, and will completely break those who have hitherto been oppressors. “For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise; and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.” (Isa. 9: 4, 5) “Thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!”—Isa. 14:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Within themselves the remnant of the Lord arc weak, but they are strong in the Lord and in the power of his might because they rely wholly upon him and obey his commandments. (Eph. 6: 10) They fight under their Leader, and they will see the enemy made Christ’s footstool and crushed like as Jehu crushed Jezebel.—2 Ki. 9:33; Ps. 110:1,5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> Zechariah further prophesies concerning God’s militant organization: “And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets [of Satan’s organization] in the battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.” (Zech. 10:5) The remnant, now being assured by the Lord of the final result of the battle, are greatly encouraged and with shouts of victory continue to perform their duties at the temple. The Lord is with them in the temple and gives them courage to work and to fight. The army of Jehovah will complctelj<sup>-</sup> crush the enemy : “Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations; and with thee will I destroy kingdoms.” (Jer. 51:20,21) It is the temple organization that Jehovah thus uses. “Speak to Zerubbabcl, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth, and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen: and 1 will overthrow’ the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.” (Hag. 2:21,22) The visible part of Satan's organization will be greatly confounded, and because not having a visible foe against which to fight they will fight and slay each other.—Judg. 7:22; 2 Chron. 20:22,23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> In the house of Joseph his son Ephraim took the foremost position. Zechariah’s prophecy now shows Judah and the house of Joseph standing unitedly together, which shows that the remnant that come from all parts of the earth are at unity in Christ and solidly against the enemy, and which happy condition has now been reached by the remnant. “And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them [I will cause them to dwell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin]; for 1 have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord their God, and will hear them.” (Zech. 10: 6) The remnant now fully united are prepared for war, and forgetting all their troubles of the past, and relying wholly upon their Leader and Jehovah, without fear they follow their glorious Leader on to victory: “Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west, I will say to the north, Give up: and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth: even every one that is called by my name; for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.” (Isa. 43:5-7) These faithful members of the temple class are now as though they had never been cast off, and they have full assurance that Jehovah God will hear them and shield and protect them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> “Ephraim” means “double fruitfulness”, and hence pictures the Christ, including the remnant, after receiving from Jehovah a double of his favor and entering into prosperity. In harmony with this the prophet Zechariah says: “And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the Lord.” (Zech. 10:7) This united host of the Lord is led by the “most Mighty ”, who rides prosperously and is certain of great victory and whose arrows smite the enemy. (Ps. 45: 3-5; Isa. 13: 3) The members of his army are called and set aside and prepared specifically for God’s purpose to express his anger against the enemy. They are “mighty men of valour for the war”. (1 Chron. 12: 25) After the sanctuary is cleansed and all made ready for the war, “they shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks.” (Joel 2:7) The prophet Zechariah says, “Their children shall see it,” manifestly referring to the remnant-childrin of God’s organization, who bear no carnal or actually destructive weapons but who sing the praises of Jehovah and who see the complete victory of the Greater Jehu over all of God's enemies. “Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, and see the reward of the wicked.” —Ps. 91 : S.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> As in times past, at the present the enemy hiss at God's people, wag their heads, and gnash their teeth against them, but the tables will be turned on the enemies. (Lam. 2: 15, 16) Zechariah's prophecy says: “I will hiss for them [Lccscr, I will call </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{margin, </span><span class="font3">whistle) for them], and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.” (Zech. 10:8) The hiss or whistle of the Lord here is for the purpose of drawing the attention of his people and gathering them together, even as a shepherd gives a shrill whistle for his flock. The hiss of Jehovah suggests that he calls attention of his people to his message of vengeance and assembles them for the purpose of making announcement of this message. The Lord's army is no part of Satan’s world, and when the Lord calls or hisses his faithful ones come with swift speed and, in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, march on to the battle. (Isa. 5: 26, 27) Those who make up the Esther and Ruth class have been called and added to the anointed One since 1922 and are included here in the remnant, and hence are of the ‘ ‘ redeemed ’ ’ and of those that ‘ ‘ have increased ’</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> Jehovah has placed his faithful witnesses amongst the peoples of earth, but not all in one place. They are scattered about for the purpose of performing the will of God. “And I will sow them among the people [peoples, R.V.]; and they shall remember me in far countries: and they shall live with their children, and turn again.” (Zech. 10:9) In the various countries where Jehovah’s witnesses are they keep in mind that Jehovah is their shield and strength and that they are his representatives; and like the ‘valley of dry bones’ these scattered ones were at one time discouraged but now are revived, and they joyfully enter into and proceed in the service of the Lord regardless of their location. Jehovah has been pleased to use the Watch Tower publications to bring to these his present-day truth, even as Ezekiel was used to prophesy to the valley of dry bones and caused them to revive. Now the faithful remnant see that Jehovah has returned his favor to his own people and has united them in Christ and prepared them for his use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Jehovah has prepared the remnant for war service by bringing them out and completely separating them from Satan’s organization, and concerning this his prophet says: “I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and place shall not be found for them.” (Zech. 10:10) Egypt here stands for the commercial, while Assyria stands for the political and religious elements of Satan’s organization. Out from this Jehovah has brought his faithful remnant, and they in obedience to his command declare his vengeance against Satan’s organization and advertise God’s kingdom and continue to sing forth the praises of his name: “At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.” (Zeph. 3:20) Jehovah brings his remnant “into the land of Gilead”, which name means the “heap of testimony” and which applies to Jehovah’s present-day remnant. He brings them to “Lebanon”, meaning “white”, and which applies to Jehovah’s righteous kingdom. Now the Most High has brought the remnant into the condition symbolized by Gilead and Lebanon, and they by delivering “the testimony of Jesus Christ” of and concerning Jehovah and his righteous kingdom thus bring ‘the balm of Gilead’ to those who hunger and thirst for the righteous kingdom of God. (Jer. 8:22; Judg. 7:3) ‘No permanent abiding place shall be found for them,’ the remnant on the earth, but they must bear tire testimony to the “prisoner” class and to the Jonadab class and to all as a warning and as a witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The prophet then indicates that the faithful remnant will no more be prevented from giving testimony to the name of Jehovah: “And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea [according to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font3"> Though he pass through a sea of affliction, yet shall he smite the sea with its waves], and all the deeps of the river [Nile, which Satan claims for himself as his organization] shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.” (Zech. 10:11) The way for the advance of Jehovah’s witnesses must be cleared. “But I am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The Lord of hosts is his name. And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” (Isa. 51:15,16) This Jehovah does while he proceeds with the preparation for the great battle which will vindicate his name. Satan’s organization of commercial, political and religious elements shall no more prevent and stop the giving of testimony concerning God and his kingdom. This is full assurance to the remnant that they will continue to go forward regardless of opposition. Jehovah’s purpose is that his message shall be proclaimed, and nothing shall stop it. (Isa. 14:24,25) The “sceptre” or ruling power shall depart from Egypt, that is to say, from Satan’s organization, and Christ shall reign in righteousness, and “the sceptre shall not depart from Judah” henceforth and for ever. (Gen. 49:10) The throne of the mighty One, Christ Jesus, shall continue forever because “the sceptre of [that] kingdom is a right sceptre ’ ’.—Ps. 45:6; Heb. 1: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> To prepare his remnant for the great climax Jehovah strengthens them, and he causes Zechariah to announce his promise thus to do: “And I will strengthen them in the Lord; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the Lord.” (Zech. 10:12) The faithful remnant have been brought into the house of the Lord and there have received strength by obtaining from him a better understanding of his name and his purposes and his organization. For this reason Jehovah has loaded his table with a plenteous supply of life-strengthening food for his covenant people. The time for much talk by wise “elective elders” has passed. These the Lord does not use to feed his people. Those who give diligence to carefully study the refreshing truths that come from the Lord’s table are the ones who grow strong in him and in the power of his might. Each one must partake of the food himself by diligently applying himself to the study of that which God has provided. &quot;Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. ’ ’ (Prov. 8:14) That means to understand Jehovah and his purposes, the significance of his name, and his organization, and organization instructions, and then to diligently obey them. &quot;The way of the Lord is strength to the upright [that is to say, the lawful].” (Prov. 10:29) &quot;A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.” (Prov. 24:5) These faithful ones of the remnant who are wise in heavenly wisdom receive their assignment of territory as Jehovah’s witnesses and walk up and down in the earth delivering his testimony. This they do, not in the name of any man, but in the name of Jehovah since he has bestowed his name upon them: ‘<sup>1</sup> For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.” (Mic. 4: 5) The faithful remnant now behold the glorious King marching triumphantly on to war, and with songs of joy they follow on after him.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GOD’S LAW AND THE LAW COVENANT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">A</span><span class="font3"> CLEAR distinction between the law of God and the law covenant which God made with the Jews many centuries ago is set forth in God’s Word. The scriptural evidence on this subject serves further to magnify the name of Jehovah and to enable his people to understand the depth of his wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s way is always right. It is a great satisfaction to the seeker of truth to know that Jehovah God can never be wrong. &quot;As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried; he is a buckler to all those that trust in him. ’ ’ (Ps. 18:30) The meek desire to be taught and led in the way of God because it is right. God’s favors are for such. &quot;The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.” (Ps. 25:9) The one who desires to be led in the right way prays as David prayed: &quot;For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.” (Ps. 86: 10,11) Such receive the favor of Jehovah, and his favor is that which is of greatest value. (Prov. 16:15) Such rest confidently by faith in the Lord. &quot;For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.” (Ps. 5:12) &quot;In his favour is life.” (Ps. 30:5) These great and unchangeable truths set forth in the Scriptures stand boldly forth as a true guide for those who desire life and peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lineal descendants of Abraham under the guiding hand of Jehovah found a domicile in the land of Egypt. God took them there to use them to make pictures foreshadowing his purpose for the reconciliation of man. Egypt was a picture of this present evil world, of which Satan is the god. Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites in that land, were greatly oppressed and persecuted by the ruler of Egypt and his agencies. The Israelites had a great desire to be relieved from this oppression. In that condition they represented the peoples of earth suffering under the oppressive hand of Satan and his agents and representatives. The peoples of earth now have a great desire to be delivered from oppression and to be brought into a condition of peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Manifestly God did not interfere with this oppression for a time but permitted it to continue that the Israelites might have their hearts turned to him. They cried unto God for relief, and God sent Moses to Egypt to be the deliverer of the Israelites. In that Moses pictured the beloved Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah sent into the world to be his witness and to redeem the people of the world; and then again he comes the second time to be Jehovah's Vindicator and the great Deliverer of the peoples of earth from the oppression of Satan and from sin and death.— Deut. 18:15,18; Acts 3:19-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was when God sent Moses into Egypt that he first revealed himself as to the meaning of his name Jehovah. By that name he was to be known among the Israelites, which people were to be his favored people or nation. The name Jehovah also signifies his purposes concerning his favored people. Mark how he directed Moses to say to the Israelites what he purposed then to do. He said: ‘I will do for you these things.’ “And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the Lord.”—Ex. 6: 3, 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah then made a covenant with the nation of Israel. By that covenant he greatly honored and favored the Israelites. Among other things, he said to them: “Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” (Ex. 19:5,6) That covenant is designated in the Scriptures as the law covenant. (Gal. 3:17) It had to do with preparing the way for the reconciliation of man to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A clear distinction must be made between the law of God and his law covenant which he made with Israel. The law of God concerning man is his expressed will. It is the rule of action which he provides and which commands obedience to that which is right and punishment for wrongdoing. Abraham kept God’s law, namely his expressed will, as far as he knew it. But Abraham was not under the law covenant. “Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. ’ ’ (Gen. 26:5) “For what saith the scriptures? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. ’ ’—Horn. 4: 3,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the covenant God made with Abraham concerning the “seed” he used Abraham, and Sarah his wife, and Isaac his only son, symbolically to illustrate and picture the covenant and the offspring thereof. Abraham pictured Jehovah God; Sarah pictured the covenant; while Isaac pictured or represented the “seed” or offspring of the covenant. God made other covenants in which a woman was used to represent the covenant. In the law covenant, here under consideration, God used Hagar, a bondwoman, to picture the covenant, and her son Ishmael to foreshadow the offspring thereof. This allegory or picture was for the purpose of instructing particularly the Christians whom God in due time began to select and prepare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were designated as fathers by the Israelites. The law covenant was not given to them. “The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers.” (Deut. 5:3) Their fathers were dead before the law covenant was made. The original promise made to Abraham, and which was confirmed to Isaac and Jacob, was specifically regarding the “seed” through which blessings should come to all the families of the earth. God’s promise was not dependent upon any works of the law. His promise was unalterable, and the law added nothing thereto. Since Isaac was not under the law covenant, he pictured the “seed”, which is not under the law covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hagar was an Egyptian woman. (Gen. 16:1) She pictured or represented the law eovenant. (Gal. 4:24) It would seem appropriate, therefore, that the covenant, which she represented, should be made in Egypt. God’s prophet Jeremiah wrote concerning that covenant: “The covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.” (Jer. 31:32) “According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you; fear ye not. ’ ’—Hag. 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These scriptures show that the law covenant was made in Egypt in the day that the Israelites came out of Egypt, and that it was exactly 430 years from the time Abraham entered Canaan. It was on the fourteenth day of Nisan, 1615 B.C., that the Israelites left Egypt. Their first passover was instituted and eaten on that day. “And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt.’’ (Ex. 12:41) Paul corroborated this testimony when he wrote: “And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.”—Gal. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Paul wrote: ‘ ‘ For where a covenant is it is necessary for the death to be brought in of him that hath covenanted; for a covenant over dead persons is firm, since it is not then of force when he is living that hath covenanted.” (Heb. 9:16,17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.) </span><span class="font3">This same text the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font3"> renders, “is firm over dead victims. ’ ’ The passover lamb was the victim to be slain. Moses was represented in the passover lamb; and, the lamb being slain, Moses was considered dead from that time. This is further proof as to the time of the making of the law covenant and that it was made in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the fifteenth day of the second month, after leaving Egypt and while in the wilderness, the Israelites murmured against Moses because of their hunger. “Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.” (Ex. 16: 4, 26) The law covenant was then in force. That was before the Israelites reached Sinai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BLESSED of JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, and for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt tn the bush.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">HE “strange act” of Jehovah himself will in the near future arrest the attention of all creatures in earth and heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greatest privilege ever granted to man on earth is now given to the anointed ones, to bear witness to the establishment of God’s government among men. Such is good news to those people who will hear it, because it informs them that God’s government will lift from their shoulders the great oppression that has so long borne them down, that it will break the forces of evil and will bring to mankind that which they have so long- desired. It means the vindication of God’s great name. To have a part in joyfully proclaiming this good news means to engage in the greatest campaign that was ever held under the sun. At this time the peoples of earth are groaning in pain under the oppression of their governments. There is no government that is satisfactory to any nation or people. It is the time of man’s extremity. It is therefore the time of God’s opportunity to have his anointed make proclamation to the people that the time of their deliverance through his gracious arrangement has come. One who fails or refuses to avail himself of this opportunity is missing the greatest privilege that has ever been offered to man. Will there be many who claim to</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>WITNESSES”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">follow in the footsteps of Christ who will avail themselves of this great privilege and engage in the work that the Lord is now doing ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah foreknew and foretold that there would be but a small number. The Lord God caused the natural Israelites to foreshadow the experiences of those who are of spiritual Israel. Among the Israelites there were a few faithful, but the mass of them did not appreciate God’s favor. God gave to Isaiah his prophet a vision, and in that vision the Israelites were likened unto an olive tree with practically all the olives shaken down; and unto a vineyard with the grapes all gathered except a few to glean. (Isa. 17:6; 24:13) That foreshadowed that when the final test should come as to who would engage in the great and wonderful work of God on earth there would be but a small number who would avail themselves of that happy privilege. Isaiah and his sons were used by Jehovah as types to foreshadow what should come to pass upon professed followers of Christ. It is written by that prophet: “Behold, I, and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs and for wonders [omens or signals pointing definitely to something that must come to pass in the near future] in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.”—Isa. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even the names of Isaiah’s sons signified and foreshadowed a condition that would come upon the professed followers of Jesus. The name of one of his sons (Isa. 8:3) means the severe and inevitable judgment wherewith and by which the Lord visits his professed people. The name of another son (Isa. 7:3) means “the remnant shall return” and particularly refers to the mercy with which the Lord would receive his elect and his manner of preservation of those that love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The important point is that the experiences of Israel developed a remnant which foreshadowed that there would be a small remnant who would joyfully engage in the Lord’s work. (Isa. 1: 9) Corroborative of this Paul wrote concerning the Jews: “Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.” (Rom. 11:5) What came to pass upon natural Israel foreshadowed what would come to pass at the end of the world upon the professed followers of Christ and clearly shows that there would be a remnant at this time. A remnant is that which remains after the larger number has been taken away. That means that, after the shaking takes place and after the gathering out from the kingdom, mentioned by the Lord Jesus, a few would remain true and faithful unto God and would delight to do his will and such would be moved wholly by an unselfish devotion to him. That class constitutes the remnant. It is the remnant whom the Lord designates as that “faithful and wise servant”, to whom he commits all his goods or government interests upon the earth. (Matt. 24: 45; Isa. 42:1, 6) It is the faithful remnant that delight to obey the commands of the Lord in making proclamation of the good news. If one who is anointed by the Lord fails to be of the remnant class it is his own fault and is due to pride, indifference or negligence. It might ordinarily be expected that the greatest event in man’s history, to wit, the coming in of the government of righteousness, would be hailed by the multitudes. Not so. It has pleased God to have announcement made by those who are trusting in him regardless of all opposition. These are the ones whom he uses to do his great and marvelous work. They are small in number and are without reputation and influence among the leaders of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great issue before the minds of the people now is, Who is God? By that is meant, Whom will the people heed and obey? Whom will the people choose to serve? In order for them to make choice they must have some knowledge; and how can they gain this unless someone tells them? Jehovah is furnishing evidence to show the people that Satan for a long season has been the god of this world and the oppressor of mankind, and that now God’s time has arrived to establish his righteous government for man. He will have someone tell the people this great truth. The clergy, by their seductive theories of evolution and like false means, strive to induce the people to believe that man by his own efforts may lift himself up and bring abcut a desirable condition. These teachers of false doctrines are acting against God and as the agents of Satan the enemy. By and through them he keeps the people blind to the truth. The time has come for a witness to be given among the nations and peoples of earth, that they may have an opportunity to know who is the Almighty God from whom their blessings must come. Jehovah commands: “Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.” (Isa. 43:8) Then he commands that the nations shall be gathered and the people assembled that they may hear. The clergy and the false teachers are called upon to prove their theories or else admit that they are wrong and agree to God’s truth. “Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It’s truth.”—Isa. 43:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There must be someone to take the side of the Lord and give the testimony as to who is the great and mighty God. Jehovah selects the remnant for this honorable work, and speaking to them he says: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10,12) This witness must be given, even as Jesus commanded, that the peoples of earth may have an opportunity to determine the issue, Who is God? Surely there could be no more honorable and blessed position than that of serving the great Jehovah of the universe as his ambassador at this time!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jehovah is about to perform a great act he gives notice thereof. He caused Noah to preach many years to the people, telling them of the coming deluge that would destroy all life upon the earth. (Gen. 6: 12-17; 2 Pet. 2:5) When God would deliver his chosen people from Egypt and overthrow that wicked government that oppressed them, and which government was a type of Satan's organization, he caused notice to be served upon the rulers of Egypt. (Ex. 7:1, 2) When God was about to destroy the Jews and leave their house desolate unto them he caused notice to be served upon them, and particularly upon their rulers. (Alatt. 21:43; 23:34-39) In each instance he chose as his witnesses men who were devoted to him. And now, when God would complete his great work in the establishment of his righteous government upon earth and which shall dash to pieces all of Satan’s organization, he causes notice to be served upon the rulers and upon the people. He chooses not the selfish and arrogant to do this work. To his anointed ones who were called and chosen and who continue faithful he grants the great privilege of representing him at this time. (Isa. 61:1-3; 6: 8-11) It is the remnant by the Lord’s grace that carries on this work. Following 1918 a little company of Christian people have been making proclamation to the rulers of the nations of the earth that the time for the establishment of God’s righteous government for the blessing of the people has come.</span></p>
