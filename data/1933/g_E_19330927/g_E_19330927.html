<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>More About the Clothing of Men and Women</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE French are rated as having a weakness for uniforms. Every kind of man in every kind of job where it is possible is put in a uniform. When the uniforms are badly worn they go to Africa, where they do duty all over again. The black man is never so happy as when in a white man's cast-off uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Theatrical costumes, after a theatrical production has folded up, go to gladden the hearts of bucks in the Cameroons or Basutoland. The world's recognized market for tin stage-armor is northern Zululand, and it seems that they insist on wearing it even on the hottest days. It is said that native soldiers fight better when dressed in gaudy uniforms. The Devil had that all figured out long ago. Fenton's translation of Ezekiel 28:12 says: &quot;Thou art a past master of science.” Military uniforms, and their effects upon the minds of men and women, have had much to do with maintaining the Devil's institutions, and still have much to do therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The cast-off clothing of New Yorkers goes all over the world. On Elizabeth street, in the heart of Chinatown, New York city, the street is lined with stores which will buy anything in the line of clothing or shoes that has anything of present or prospective value left in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The highest grades of men’s and women’s wearing apparel are sold secondhand to New Yorkers themselves who know where to locate such shops. There are women who scorn to be seen more than once or twice in the same gown, or who dispose of dresses which their husbands do not like. Some tailors bluff their richest customers into thinking they need new suits, when all that the old ones need is pressing and they are as good as ever. Then they get the cast-off clothes as a perquisite.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Shoes — Stockings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">In the days of the Roman Empire laws were passed which tried to regulate the style of shoe to be worn by each class. It was a foolish law.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">In the Middle Ages the pointed toes of shoes were sometimes two or three times the length of the foot. It was a foolish custom, klankind and womankind seem to possess an infinite capacity for making fools of themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Present styles in footwear seem to be sensible, as to men’s shoes. Women's high-heeled shoes are a menace to the health and life of the wearer. The heel set in the middle of the instep fools nobody, least of all the wearer. Many a woman has been crippled for life by wearing high-heeled shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Styles in shoes are certainly better now than they were in the seventeenth century, when they were so long and pointed that they were an encumbrance to the wearer and had to be hooked up by their projecting tips to make walking possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On account of their elaborate ornamentation, the shoes of cowboys, running as high as $42.50 a pair, are probably the most expensive footwear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first persons to wear stockings were priests. The first pair of silk stockings ever worn in England were made for Edward VI, son of the much-married Henry VIII by his third wife, Jane Seymour. The highest price on record for one pair of women’s hosiery is $2,000. The clocks in these consisted of real diamonds. Lace stockings at $500 to $800 a pair can be had at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The short skirts made silk stockings a necessity for all women, and lengthened them, adding $43,000,000 a year to the women’s budget for hose. Of the 60,000,000 pairs of women’s hose now made in America, less than half are of cotton. Should the stockingless fad spread, as it probably will, the demand for stockings in the summer is bound to greatly decrease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jewelry and Buttons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Precious stones are often mentioned in the Scriptures, as in the high priest’s breastplate, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">803</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">the covering of Lucifer, and in the foundations of the New Jerusalem. Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and perhaps others of the writers of Sacred Writ, mention them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tn symbolic imagery Jehovah God addresses Jerusalem (‘'■Christendom&quot;) : “I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with silk. I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.’’ •—Ezekiel 16:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nose rings and toe rings, once worn, are out of style. In the sixteenth century the popular place to wear the ring was on the thumb. Wrist rings (bracelets) are still in use. Ankle rings (anklets) are sometimes worn. The Romans wore heavy rings in summer, and lighter rings in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At any 10c store a woman can get “jewels” to fit any costume. Rich people seldom wear their genuine jewels; they keep them in the safety deposit boxes and usually exhibit themselves in carefully made imitations. It is well known that certain types of earrings are adapted to certain faces and produce impressions not otherwise obtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Buttons, as ornaments, are traced back to the year 1250 (A.D.). The earliest mention of the buttonhole occurs in the year 1561. At one time hand-made, hand-painted buttons were worth $5 apiece. As they have cheapened they have multiplied mankind's sorrows, but not woman's. She found a better way out of the dilemma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today a man has 5 buttonholes in his pajama coat, 3 in his pajama pants, 8 in his union suit, 5 in his shirt front, 8 in his soft cuffs, 3 in his collar, 3 in his shirt collar, 2 in his shirt sleeves, 6 in his trousers, 5 in his vest, 3 in his coat, and 3 in his overcoat; total, 51. A man that goes insane is said to have “lost his buttons”. The effect is substituted for the cause.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Hats and Corsets</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Julius Caesar pulled a fold of his toga over his head; it was all the hat he had or needed. Millinery got its start in Milan, Italy, whence the name Milaner, milliner. Italy still pays much attention to hats. The home of the greatest racket ever conceived on this earth, it still bestows the red hat on its chief racketeers, the cardinals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because he is naturally artistic, an Italian in his native land will wear a plume in his hat without batting an eyelash. In 1928, to offset the hatless wave then passing over the earth, a certain kind of hat, the &quot;varsity straw”, was made compulsory headgear for Italian college youths. Ever hear of Leghorn hats ? They come from Leghorn, Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The man that caused us to lose our top feathers is dead; so we cannot do anything more to him. He was a Swiss. He invented the hat in 1404, and men have been bald ever since. The hat was first made in England, in 1510. The Jews of Spain were once compelled to wear yellow hats; in Germany bankrupts had to wear yellow and green hats. Once a year the pope used to “bless” hats of violet silk, lined with ermine and embroidered with gold and jewels. He sent these around as gifts to other crooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is less than 150 years since the prince of Wales, at his first court ball, shone resplendent in a hat that was trimmed with 5,000 steel beads. He had on pink-heeled shoes, and his black velvet suit was covered with pink and gold spangles and lined with pink satin. Him must have looked booful in him’s pitty clothes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Panama hats are not made in Panama, but they come through Panama on their way to market. Ecuador, Peru and Colombia are the producers. The material is the shredded leaf of a small palm. The weavers begin work early in the morning, to keep the shreds from drying, and keep their fingers constantly damp. It takes three weeks to make a single hat, and the price on the spot is usually $50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The most costly hat of record is a $1,500 sombrero presented to General Grant in Mexico, said to be the finest specimen of a Mexican sombrero ever made. Secretary of State Seward, of Lincoln's cabinet, had a Panama hat that cost $1,000. A good cowboy’s sombrero may cost $20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because of her absence of taste, and her unwillingness to wear anything but bonnets of a certain shape, Queen Victoria had the milliners of two generations in despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The shape of the cardinals’ red hat, with its broad brim, small, flat crown, and cords and tassels of special pattern, has not changed in seven hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “stovepipe” hat now affected by politicians is an outgrowth of the Puritan steeple-crowned hat. Benjamin Franklin carried it to Paris, and Paris carried it to the ends of the earth. The Puritans wore their hats indoors and everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Britishers call a derby hat a “bowler”. The French call it a “melon”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hat sizes are fixed by measuring the length inside from front to back, and then the middle width. Add together and divide by two. The result is the size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the seventeenth century both men and women wore corsets, and they may still be had for both men and women. Not so long ago they were still in use at West Point, and may be yet. Women have greatly improved their figures and their health by their general abandonment of corsets.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Changing Women’s Styles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The universal and perpetual entertainment of the new generation is to laugh at the styles of the generation that is gone, or going. As soon as a new style appears a woman wants the thing, whatever it is, because every other woman is getting one. But as soon as every other woman really does have it, then she wants something else, because it is so generally in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Take this matter of sleeves. In the reign of Richard II they were so long and so wide that they often reached to the feet. Thieves carried their booty up their sleeves. In the reign of Henry IV a law was passed prohibiting the wearing (by men) of scarlet robes twelve yards wide, with sleeves, called “side sleeves” (a term still persisting in Britain), hanging to the ground, and bordered or lined with fur, if of the value of £20 or more. If they had to pass a law for men, where did the women get off ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under the Norman kings sleeves were fitted down as far as the elbow, there to break off into loose flaps a yard long. Sometimes these flaps were tied in a knot. Norman kings and knights wore their coats of arms on their sleeves. Almost nobody could read, and before a knight busted the head of another man he looked at his heraldic device to make sure he was pasting the right man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the days of Chaucer sleeves for both men and women were of the most beautiful and costly fabrics conceivable, and of every color imaginable. They were removable, and each sleeve of different materials and colors. A man spending a week-end in the country had to rise early so as to baste or sew on his sleeves for the day, and when he was ready to appear in company he looked like an escaped lunatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our own times have seen women dressed in jerseys with tight-fitting sleeves, and they have seen her with leg-of-mutton sleeves, tight on the lower arm and at least a foot in diameter near the shoulder. Fifty years ago she laced until she could hardly breathe. It was the style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Days of the Whale</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The whale is about gone, and what we shall do for soap when he is numbered among the missing is something somebody else will have to figure out. But in his day he made lots of excitement for the men, and provided the women with bustles, stays and hoopskirt patterns. Every woman tried to look like a whale, and some of them succeeded. There was a time when if two women met each other on a sidewalk one of them had to walk in the road. Some of the whalebone went into fans. They too have passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the jobs of the king of England is that every year he and the queen have to select four women’s dresses. That decision determines what will be worn in the British court that year. It is not such a whale of a job now as it was when hoopskirts were in vogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You don't remember the days of the bangs, do you? They were a fright. The women have labored hard through the ages to see how badly they could look, but they have looked well anyway. The worse the style, the better they show off in it, and there is a suspicion that they know that well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There has been a change in architecture, due to the change in women’s styles and in the women themselves. In 1910 the correct width for a stadium seat was considered 19 inches; now it is 17 inches, and this change enabled Princeton University to seat 6,000 more persons in its stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thousands of years ago the women of Mesopotamia wore golden hair nets and changed their style of hairdressing constantly, to keep abreast of the times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paris the Center for Women’s Styles</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Paris still nominates the styles for the rest of the world. The Toronto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font9"> says: “It may be shocking, but it is nevertheless true, that the naughty ladies of Paris come closer to being the arbiters of fashion than any other influence that could be named.” The present style in women's hats dates from the moment Lindbergh took off his aviator’s helmet at Le Bourget, after his flight from New York to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">n<sub>e</sub> QOLDEN AQE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">America buys her models in Paris, but makes her own dresses. So it has come about that Paris has become a great experimental depot at which the effort is made to find out what w’ill “take”. The artists of the world gather there, and change is always in the air. The French try to anticipate what the Americans will like, and succeed very well; but sometimes they miss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some American firms are said to employ artists whose powers of perception and memory are such that they can inspect thirty model dresses and go to their rooms and draw every one of the thirty, and color it just as it was in the original. The drawings are then sent posthaste to America, and sometimes enable the American manufacturers to get a start of a week or more on what is doing in Paris. This bootlegging of fashions is rightly considered a disreputable piece of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Paris employs both male and female manikins to exhibit models, the males having only recently been put to work. The general use in America of the automobile has had a distinct effect on styles. Out of twenty models carefully and painfully and secretively designed, it may be that only one or two will make a hit, and nobody can tell which they will be until the manikins begin their parades. Fashion is a perennial gamble. Nobody can direct it long.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Women Have Achieved Dress Reform</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The women have achieved dress reform, and it looks as if the reform is a permanent one. The move toward pajamas is probably only a fad. Skirts are really more becoming, more comfortable, and more sanitary. And they are cooler, too. When a leg or arm is wholly enclosed it is made unduly warm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font9"> dog carries only about one-fiftieth of his weight in fur, and seems to get along all right in cold weather. A man that weighs 150 pounds will have 15 pounds of clothes. It is too much. Women now have clothes that weigh only about one-tenth what they used to weigh. And they do not complain of feeling the cold. But they would not complain anyway, if it was the style, even if they froze solid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The reduction in feminine clothes, i.e., the reduction in weight, has definitely added to feminine health and stamina. The puny, neurasthenic women of fifty years ago are no longer to be seen. British physicians who have examined thousands of boys and girls report that the girls are much better developed than the boys. Women’s clothes are all washable, too, and that has not a little to do wfith their better health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Life Extension Institute, which made a study of the facts, states that the average weight of a man’s clothing, minus his shoes, is ten pounds, while the average weight of a woman's clothing, minus her shoes, is 22 ounces, or just one-fifth that of the man’s, and the woman, in her featherweight apparel, can outwalk, outdance, outrun and outswim her mate. Women's thin summer clothing, with its lack of tight collars and belts, has always been the envy’ of the men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another important item: A woman can buy three or four dresses, and look beautiful in each of them, for the price the man has to pay for a single suit. Masculine taste is to dress well enough to be unnoticcable; feminine ambition is to dress well enough to attract attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With a machine or device specially made for the purpose, the Hygienic Institute of the University<sup>7</sup> of Munich proved that tight-fitting clothes, and especially the perfect fit of a coat, should be avoided. Everything must be loose on the body. Sleeves and trousers, in particular, should have wide openings. An open or V-form collar should be preferred to any’ other.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The Fight for Short Skirts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The French designers first put the women into short skirts, and they were obedient enough. Then, in 1927, they<sup>7</sup> tried to move them the other way, and the women would not budge. They liked the freedom of the short skirts, and every’-body liked the pretty silk stockings. The women won out, and it so discouraged and disgusted the leading French designer, Paul Poiret, that he retired from the conflict, and has settled down in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The president of the French Academy’ was similarly affected. He said, mournfully, that now, “when you have painted half the length of a woman's portrait, there is nothing more worth painting.” As artistic material for a canvas he considers the flowing robes of a long dress much more interesting than the prettiest pair of silk stockings ever made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The girls of Hunter College, New York, put the matter to a vote, 6,000 of them voting, and seventy percent of them revealed themselves as rebels against long skirts, ■which they denounced as impractical, uncomfortable, uneconomical, inconvenient in the subway, and unhygienic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The result of the action of the girls of Hunter College, and literally millions of other American girls and women, was a buyers’ strike which nearly ruined many department stores and created a panic in Paris. Hitherto the designers had led the way and the women followed, but on long dresses, nix. The department stores that carried only the long dresses in stock found that the average selling time for each dress had increased about one-third. Sales fell off alarmingly. The women won the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The cloth-makers were intensely interested in this fight. When it started they announced cheerfully that &quot;something like 150,000,000 more yards of varied fabrics will be ordered in a year to make the long, flowing draperies of the evening frocks, and the circular and flared skirts of day dresses&quot;; but it did not take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Budapest, in 1930, a young woman sued an elderly man because he stepped on the train of her dress. That would have been all right but the shoulder straps of her dress both snapped; and if you know what happened then, you had better come in here and write about it, for the thing is too complicated to fit into this typewriter. The court ruled that that man was not to blame; the girl had a right to wear what she pleased, but it was her business to look after her skirts and not have them in a place where they could be walked on; a good argument for short skirts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Men Shocked (?) by Short Skirts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The minute you find a man who sees anything wrong with a girl's wearing short skirts you may know right away that you cannot trust him as far as you could throw a bull by the tail; the biggest squawkers about a thing of this kind are mentally unbalanced on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Once in a while comes a statement from Vatican City about “the shameless immodesty of dress of modern women which results in insults to the eyes of God”. When the Creator made woman He made a beautiful thing and endowed her with enough sense to take proper care of herself without having a bunch of more or less celibate priests, who themselves dress in long skirts, wailing over her “lost condition” because she reveals some of her charms. Silly attacks on women’s dress have been carried by the Roman clergy all over the world, and accomplished exactly nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the congress of idolatry, otherwise called the “Eucharistic Congress”, came off at Dublin, the Irish girls were obliged to have sleeves sewn in their dresses. It is a wonder that the rules did not require them to be sewn up in sacks. The whole thing harks back to the harem and the purdah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the duties of the “apostolic” administrator of the Tyrol is to see to it that no girl wears flesh-colored stockings, and that her dresses have sleeves to the elbows, skirts halfway between knee and ankle, and collars that come within two inches of the neck. Perchance he sallies forth to “righteousness” with a tape measure and opera glasses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The bishop of Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, France, even went so far as to prohibit boys’ wearing their shirts open too 1ow</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>t</sup></span><span class="font9"> at the neck. He is in the wrong business. He should be a mortician.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>League of Nations Takes a Hand</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The League of Nations thought that if righteousness is merely a matter of covering up more of the women, they might as well have a hand in it, and followed up the Vatican’s pronuncia-mentos by forbidding bare legs to women entering the administration buildings, and prohibiting lawn tennis in bathing costumes. Women should be kept in bags, with puckering strings around the necks. The influence of the zenana and seraglio is plainly discernible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">General Pangalos, of Greece, undertook to interfere with the length of women’s skirts and got fired out of his job. Served him right. Meantime the progressive Kemal Pasha abolished the veil throughout Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the “apostolic” spasm of righteousness over the length of women’s skirts spread around the world, there were frequent repercussions. In Budapest the wife of an American theater manager was arrested for indecent exposure as she was leaving a theater’ where she had witnessed a play. She had on a dress designed by one of Paris’ most eminent designers, Jeanne Lanvin, and says she is through with Hungary for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Asbury Park the board of old women and hypocrites comprising the Hotel Association went before the city fathers and tried to have women dressed in beach pajamas ruled as improperly dressed. A waste of breath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Jerusalem the rabbis covered the billboards with Jewish proclamations that girls would hereafter clothe themselves with the garments worn by their mothers “and little girls must be trained to wear their sleeves down to the greater part of their hand and their skirts to cover the greater part of their legs'’. How silly! Seems as if they could find something more important, and more nearly their own business, to talk about.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Suggestions About Women’s Dress</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Men like manly men and womanly women. That is why men that dross in skirts make a poor hit with men, and why men do not rave over women dressed in bloomers or street pajamas ; not, however, that the women have not a perfect right to wear them, if they choose, but that women look more attractive in skirts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Paris court decided that a famous woman athlete was free to dress as she pleased as a private citizen, but as she insists on dressing in male garb she can, with propriety, be excluded from the French Women’s Sporting Federation unless, when she attends the Federation, she adopts women's attire. Seems like a sensible rule. Women should dress as women; men, as men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No man can effectively dictate to women what they shall wear, and the women change their tastes, and are often illogical. When stagecoaches were small and crowded, women wore crinolines. The women of the present are the best dressed they have ever been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One style changes another, profoundly. Short hair caused total loss of employment to 12,000 women in Chefoo, engaged in the making of hair nets. The general use of rayon has made great changes. The general use of the automobile will inevitably keep skirts short. Style affects and is affected by everything, houses, rooms, cars, offices, clothing, hairdressing, etc. The influence of demons is seen in the fact that fashionable women of London go to clairvoyants to get suggestions regarding dress designs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Practical suggestions are that women who seek to look slender should choose dull colors and keep to the same tones throughout the costume. To enhance the height, emphasize the vertical lines and avoid encircling ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Black suggests the cynic, gray the humble, violet and purple the aristocrat, deep blue the thoughtful, light blue the frivolous, turquoise the witty, crimson the ardent and romantic; green, wholesomeness; yellow, entertainment; orange, conviviality. We take these from a lecture on color given in the Brooklyn Museum, by Nan Hornbeck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the reign of Louis XIV there were 500 fan-makers in Paris: now maybe there are five, but maybe not one. In the reign of Edward VI a woman worth £200 might have a silk dress; otherwise not. If a man was worth that amount he might have buttons at the knees and wear gold lace or silver lace. JFe laugh; and so will </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font9"> (our descendants). Furs of animals tortured by being caught in steel traps are no longer popular; other furs may be had.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Trend to Standardization</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The quaint costumes of remote corners of the earth are rapidly disappearing before the march of Western men and women in airplanes and automobiles, and especially before the march of the motion-picture man, showing Hollywood styles in every part of the planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Japan, though it still uses millions of kimonos, has switched over to Western dress almost bodily and China is rapidly following suit. It is asserted that a well-made kimono could be made to last forty years. As now made the kimono is of one piece, uncut. The garment is ripped entirely apart and washed in corn oil twice a year. The material is only twelve inches wide. The finest old gowns of China have been shipped to New York and cut into hangings and neckties. The ancient silks are superior to the tin-laden fabrics of the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The changes of dress enforced in Turkey have often been mentioned of late in the public press. Kemal Pasha insists that all Turkey shall dress in Western togs. Something of the same insistence seems to animate the rulers of Bolivia, who have just relegated to limbo the styles that have come down from the days of the Spanish conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Hungarian girls still wear from eight to a dozen daintily embroidered petticoats, all in different colors, handed down from many generations. Marriage trousseaus are objects of veneration approaching ancestor worship. It is a custom that should go, and probably will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Overalls are now worn by all the women in a mill in New Bedford, Mass., on the ground that they are less liable to catch in machinery. A London maker of men's shirts has brought out a style for women.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Common Sense in Dress versus Snobbery</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The desire to be well dressed is common, and it is reasonable. The desire to be overdressed, and the inclination to be proud because one has something in clothes that others do not have or cannot afford, is snobbery. Yet it does not seem that sameness is desirable in a world where there are such possibilities of color and of style. Look at the flowers. No two are exactly alike, even though there are thousands of styles, and millions made according to each style. Nevertheless, variations of costume were unknown to most of the nations of the ancient world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Hungary the Ministry of Culture ordered all schoolgirls to wear a common uniform, including sailor blouses. The style spread to Atlantic City, where, the last we knew, the highschool girls, in the effort to stop snobbery, were wearing middy blouses and blue skirts, which uniform, incidentally, is very becoming to young girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In English boarding schools for boys loud checks and Oxford bags are not allowed. Sunday suits of young men must be navy blue or dark gray. The black coat and striped trouser combination is taboo. The only cap allowed is the school cap. Only white soft collars are allowed. Socks must be black. In summer they may wear gray flannel shirts with collar attached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The claim is made for the British that they are much less interested in style, and a good deal more insistent upon quality, than Americans. But the reverse claim is made that the leisured class in England is easily distinguishable by its clothes, while the clerks and small shopkeepers dress badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Paris, to be well dressed, a woman is said to need from six to twenty umbrellas, one to go with each costume. In ancient Sparta they were not burdened with such foolishness, as the law permitted women only three dresses. The tendency of democracies is away from dress distinctions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Reformers have always been against dress extravagance. Legislation against the wearing of costly apparel has been often enacted, but never accomplished anything. The extent to which expensive dressing may go was shown in the case of Madame Jeritza, the upkeep of whose wardrobe cost her between $40,000 and $50,000 a year. She had more than 200 pairs of shoes, and more than 500 pairs of hose, and was considered the best-dressed woman in grand opera. It is estimated that women spend more than twice as much on clothes now as they did before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The girl of today can have a good-sized wardrobe for what it cost her grandmother for a single taffeta silk dress. Modern clothing is not made to last for generations. American girls do not wish to wear the old clothes worn by their great-grandmothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hard times have wrought changes in women’s garb. Reversible coats are to be had. Chiffon dresses are made with two or more slips. The new artificial laces are both beautiful and unalterable ; they wear well, are waterproof and are less combustible than ordinary lace. In the West Indies there is a natural lace-like cloth which is used by the native women for dresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Perhaps, in the end, with a perfect climate, man may be clothed almost as he was in Eden, but probably not quite. Clothes, if always worn, will ever remind mankind of a time when they were naked before God and in need of the covering which in His great love He has provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Favors of “Holy Year”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">N</span><span class="font9">OTICE how nicely it is all fixed up in the &quot;'Holy Year<sup>-</sup>’. The two most prominent Americans are Franklin D. Roosevelt, Protestant, and Alfred E. Smith, Roman Catholic. Mr. Roosevelt is given the degree of LL.D, at the Roman Catholic university in Washington, and Mr. Smith is given the degree of LL.D, at the Protestant university of Harvard. Guests at the latter award of degrees were J. P. Morgan and Owen D. Young, with big politicians not a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dispatches from Vatican City are that the ‘’Holy Year” will probably be prolonged for seven or eight weeks after it would normally end, carrying it over until May 20 or 27, next year. Meantime the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus pledged unanimous support of the Roosevelt policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Meantime, also, the K. of C. Holy Name Society is bending every energy to close the mouth of Judge Rutherford: to prevent him from broadcasting the truth over the radio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rome — Aholah’s Holy City</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ean Alford, in his letters from abroad, describing the city of Rome, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Rome is essentially a pagan city. Her churches . . . rise everywhere around. Bells are continually going . . . Yet, with very rare exceptions indeed, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">worship of the people</span><span class="font8"> in these churches has nothing in common with Christianity. . . . God has passed out from the practical worship of the people: the Son of God has, as a matter of fact, ceased to be an object of their adoration. The Eternal Father is found in their pictures as an old man, — the divine Savior as a little child; but both are subservient, and nearly all their worship is subservient, to one purpose: the glorification of a great goddess” (Mary).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Rome contains 433 churches and chapels. Five are dedicated to the “Trinity”, fifteen to the Savior, four to the crucifix, two to the sacraments, two to the “Holy Ghost”, and 121 to the virgin Mary. Not one of them, of course, is dedicated to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>The Rock of Peter</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HAT this matter of the primacy of Peter has been a matter of serious strife in the Roman Catholic church is apparent from the following memorandum accredited to Archbishop Kenrick, of St. Louis:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Five varying interpretations of S. Matt. xvi. 18 occur. The first, that the church is built on the rock of Peter, is taught by seventeen fathers; the second, that the rock is the whole body of the apostles, represented by Peter in right of his primacy, is held by eight; the third, that the rock is the faith which Peter confessed, is the most authoritative, being supported by forty-four; the fourth, that the rock is Christ himself, is held by sixteen; while the fifth interpretation makes the rock to include all the faithful, being the living stones of which the church is built. No numbers are assigned to this last view, and it is to be observed that several of those who maintain the first and second opinions also support the third and fourth, and so may be deducted from the calculations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Accordingly, Archbishop Kenrick sums up thus: “ ‘If we are bound to follow the greater number of the fathers in this matter, then we must hold for certain that the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">petra</span><span class="font8"> means, not Peter professing the faith, but the faith professed by Peter.’ ”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>The Purgatory Swindle</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">O</span><span class="font9">UT of 410 Roman Catholic priests, who, between them, left the very considerable sum of £12,499,868, only 84 of them believed sufficiently in “purgatory” to leave £31,779 for the ‘release of their souls from its fires’. When it came to their cash they bet 390 to 1 that the whole thing is a swindle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Father” J. Barrett, who left £12,547 and provided for the celebration of masses for 500 years after his death, was one of those who really believed in “purgatory”, of which he gives us the following secondhand description:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Good God! how the great saints and doctors astonish me when they treat of this fire, and of the pain of sense, as they call it. For they peremptorily pronounce that the fire that purges those souls, those both happy and unhappy souls, surpasses all the torments that are to be found in this miserable life of man, or are possible to be invented; for so far they go. Out of which assertion it clearly follows that the furious fits of the stone, fever, or raging gout, the tormenting colic, with all the horrible convulsions of the worst diseases, nay, though you join racks, gridirons. boiling oil, wild beasts, and a hundred horses drawing several ways and tearing one limb from another, with all the hellish devices of the most barbarous and cruel tyrants, all this does not reach the least part of the mildest pains in purgatory.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">In a letter to radio station KGKY, seeking the removal of the Watchtower programs from the air, the Reverend Fullam delivers himself of the following paragraph, after which, with true Roman Catholic hypocrisy, he has the unmitigated gall to conclude with the expression, &quot;In the spirit of American fair-play: ‘Live and let live.’ ”</span></p>

Judge Rutherford has defamed nobody and destroyed nobody's religious freedom. Ue has made no vitriolic remarks and no vituperative attacks. He has not assailed any lawabiding citizens, let alone 20,000,000 of them. He has not shot poisonous arrows at anybody, not slandered the pope and not made venomous detractions against him, and his utterances are not vicious, but clean, true and wholesome, filled with logic, beauty and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then what is it all about ? Nothing at all, except that Judge Rutherford has several times challenged the pope to appoint his best man, so that the two of them may, over the radio, discuss the interesting and important question as to whether or not the pope, claiming to represent Jehovah God, does in truth and in fact represent the Devil, of whom, it is apparent, the Reverend Janies P. Fullam is such a well-favored and buxom child.—John 8: 42-44.</span></p>

Many of them pass their examinations and are ordained only to find that they may have to wait for years before a congregation becomes available.

And now there are more of them for sale than ever, for the farmers have risen in revolt and are refusing to pay them to anybody at all.</span></p>

And then here is Judge Rutherford, talking regularly over many times as many stations, and never asks anybody for a red cent. And further, it would be hard for anybody to offer a valid reason why the Cadman programs should be financed, but Judge Rutherford’s addresses contain food for the mind and heart of all classes, rich and poor, high and low, and are worthy of universal support.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">UR SUNDAY VISITOR,</span><span class="font9"> Roman Catholic paper of Huntington, Indiana, once edited by an ex-Presbyterian minister, cpiotes at length and approvingly from the writings of B. E. Remaley, of Portland, Oregon, once a prominent ‘Bible Student’ of that city, in which that gentleman is quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one knows better, or should know better, than the officials of the Watch Tower Society who were sentenced and served nine months in the Atlanta penitentiary, that the offense was not on account of religious faith or doctrine, but on account of the Espionage Act, and they were amenable. And not only amenable to that but also to God's law as expressed in Romans 13: 1-15, and suffered as evil-doers, and not for righteousness’ sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It will be apparent from this that this former ‘Bible Student’ has taken his stand with the one that led J esus up into a high mountain and offered Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time if He would fall down and worship him. He has taken his stand with those that are for Big Berthas, howitzers, shrapnel, machine guns, flame-throwers, poison gas or anything else that will lend support to the Devil’s empire, and he is against the Prince of Peace, who said “Blessed are the peacemakers”, “Love your enemies,” “Put up thy sword into the sheath,” “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,” “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,” and “If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Remaley could now be a good and acceptable priest of the Roman Catholic church, for he believes essentially what they believe, and could be and is a comfort to its priests in their judgment day and when they are engaged in their great fight of trying to suppress the message of God’s kingdom, the hope of the world. Everything indicates that all the enemies of the Lord will be in essential agreement just when Armageddon puts the quietus on their activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In our judgment President Roosevelt would be consulting the best interests of the American people, and his own best interests, in severing connection with these groups that worship Satan, and are actuated by his spirit; but it is for him to do as he thinks best.</span></p>

Everyone shouted, and into the night stillness went the sound of many voices. In the center of the ring stood a lone woman; she was manacled and bound. At her feet was a pile of faggots. A man advanced and lit the pile. As the tiny flames licked their way up the doomed woman's clothes, her lips curled in defiance. Men laughed. It was all right. They were burning a witch. Hadn't she bewildered the poor multitude with her witching? Women shrieked; children were held spellbound by the face on that woman. Some few turned away in disgust. One lone scream rent the air as the flames reached the poor creature's vitals. The show was over, and the many agreed that it had been a good show. But that was way back in the middle ages. Things, thank Heaven, don't happen like that nowadays. This is 193d. We are broadminded, and tolerant. Yes, sir! Judge Rutherford and his religion has been banned from the Canadian air.

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE Arlington (Massachusetts) </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Neus,</span><span class="font9"> in an editorial entitled &quot;Whom Shall We Believe gives its readers some good advice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When we turn on our radio in these days we hear the voice of the church, Protestant, Catholic, Jew and others. All speak with authority, presumably all have a message for all people, or why is it broadcast for all to hear, rather than being confined to any particular group or parish? Out of this volume of talk, much of which is good, some bad, it becomes difficult to sift the wheat from the chaff. It is refreshing that Judge Rutherford on Easter Sunday reminded us that the Bible still points the way and in spite of the failure of governments and church leaders to remain true to spiritual ideals, Jesus still reigns and His witnesses are known by the fruits of the spirit which are justice, love and mercy. The world is anxious, waiting for God's message, tired of the propaganda of false prophets. Therefore we welcome the voice that admonishes us to trust God, read and study the Bible and place our dependence in the things of the spirit. It is not our business to point out what church leaders should talk about, but we believe that the public is getting an overdose of propaganda and not enough pure religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the day that the foregoing appeared, Reverend Lewis Hall, pastor, 11 AVhite street, Arlington, wrote to the editor of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Neus</span><span class="font9"> saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I have just completed reading your editorial entitled ‘Whom Shall We Believe?’ It is refreshing to read such an editorial which challenges people to place a faith in God. Certainly the present conditions indicate that material things have failed those who depended upon them. Turning to principles of righteous living and contacts with the Eternal, men find a never failing God who is ‘our refuge and strength in time of trouble.’ I congratulate you on your splendid editorial which I hope many will read candidly.” </span><span class="font9">We consider this a good letter, the writing of which should bring a real blessing to its author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Robot Preacher Now — Ban Beaten </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Reynolds’ Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Reprinted from the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Sacs)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">ROBOT archbishop in every parish, and a clergy list on the dole. Such is a possibility of the future should the church decide to follow the example of the evangelist - who - is - in -301 - places - at - once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have just experienced the most remarkable religious adventure of a lifetime. I have been to a robot church and listened to the address of a preacher who was eating his dinner on the high seas thousands of miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With a congregation of a thousand I have stared at an empty rostrum, an empty chair and a bunch of flowers. I have heard the voice of the preacher emerging from the flowers, and sweet organ music filling the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I have gazed in fascination at the organ and the open hymn-books on the illuminated musicrest. The books were visible because the organist who should have sat in front of them was invisible. Everything was so realistic, and yet so unreal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And it all came to pass because of a ban by the B.B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As I listened to the preacher he was speeding to New York on an ocean liner. And whatever he may have been doing aboard ship at the moment, he was also talking, without opening his mouth, to congregations in 299 other places in all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It sounds fantastic, but science has made it ridiculously simple. It’s just a matter of exploiting wireless and the gramophone. Everybody knows that records arc regularly “put on the air.” But few realize that since the talkie invasion the science has been developing quietly in religious circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And the man who has done more than anybody to exploit to the fullest extent the possibilities of mechanical voice reproduction is Judge J. F. Rutherford, an American lawyer, who has given up the bench and his legal practice in order to devote his life to Bible teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All do not agree with Judge Rutherford’s teachings. The B.B.C., for example, refused to allow him to state his views from their studios. Canadian radio stations banned him too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yet he believed that thousands were eager for his message through the ether, and he found it humanly impossible to give personal broadcasts from all the American, European, Chinese, and other radio stations that were willing to ‘’sell him some air.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So he preached his sermons to a recording machine, and the records are now broadcast to millions. But even records cannot get past the B.B.C. and the Canadian stations that frown on controversial topics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That made Judge Rutherford think of his “electrical transcriptions.” It is all very simple. A hall is hired and wired under the very nose of the B.B.C. Records are played behind the scenes and linked up with an amplifier which takes the place of the speaker on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sermons are split into three 22-inch discs, and voice reproduction is perfect. The illusion is complete if the listener closes his eyes. Otherwise the effect is ghostly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Electrical transcriptions” take place regularly in three London centers each week. Others are added from time to time. There was a touch of irony about the one I attended, for ushers at the entrance to the hall wore caps bearing the initials “B.B.C.” But the men were not engineers from Broadcasting House. They were employed by the Battersea Borough Council which leased the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Five Pentecostal Preachers Hear the Good News </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font9"> IT. IF. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nelson (California)</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font9">IFE and I witnessed to a lady over the back fence of our home, which resulted in placing some booklets, among which was a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Lord's Beturn.</span><span class="font9"> This lady was a member of the Pentecostal church, to which she had belonged only eight months, having been a Catholic all her life previous to that. She had never seen the inside of a Bible until eight months ago, and was particularly interested in the Lord's return, as she said their preacher was always talking about the return soon of Jesus. Now it seems that ‘some of the good sisters’ of her congregation came to her home and found her reading these booklets and became quite excited about it and told her they were poisonous. She came over to the house and questioned me for quite a long time, and we took the Bible and went over the different points until she became convinced it was the truth, and she took home quite a few more. In a few days her pastor came down and said, “I hear, Sister B----, you</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">are reading some of that poisonous literature of Judge Rutherford.” She replied, “Why, these books are wonderful, and you can prove everything in them by looking up the scriptures, which he gives, and you find that they are just as they are written in my Bible.” The preacher became</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">quite angry and they had quite a set-to, but this Mrs. B---- is Irish and she gave him plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, the result of this was that on the following Sunday evening, at the church, after the meeting, the preacher said to the congregation, “Dear brethren, I want you to pray for Sister B----,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">because the Devil has gotten a hold of her mind, and is threatening to destroy her soul.” Mrs. B---jumped up and asked him how she was</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">being destroyed; and he said, “By reading the terrible books of Judge Rutherford.” This made Mrs. B----quite angry, and she challenged the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">preacher to prove they were poisonous and of the Devil. And so the poor fool set the next night as the time he would prove to his congregation that they were of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On Monday night two hundred and fifty church members of this and other Pentecostal churches, with four other preachers, turned out for the show-down, the five preachers sitting up in the pulpit. Mrs. B——- brought the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Lord's Beturn</span><span class="font9"> booklet and asked McKee, her preacher, if he would read out the poisonous parts of the book; but he refused. She then got her Irish up and said, “You tried to make a fool of me last night before this whole congregation, and now you are going to hear what is in this book;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and if you won’t read it, I will”; and, turning to the congregation, she asked them to get their Bibles out and verify all the Scripture citations, and for an hour and fifteen minutes she read this booklet to them and gave different ones the Scriptural citations and had them look them up, and the five preachers sat there during this whole time and all they said was, “Lord Jesus, rebuke her! Lord Jesus, rebuke her!” Finally Mrs. B----became exasperated and said, “Oh,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">rebuke, hell! You have been trying to have Jesus rebuke me; why don’t you call on your father the Devil?” The preacher sat down, and one of the other preachers turned to him and said, ‘‘Well, Brother McKee, I am glad she is not in my congregation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the meeting was over, one of the oldest members asked for the booklet and took it home with her to read. The other members stood around and kept saying, “Why, they [meaning the preachers] didn’t say a word; there must be some truth in those books.” And they came to this Mrs. B---- and asked her questions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">about it, and she sure had good answers for them; and to think! she has heard of the truth only in the last month or, possibly, five weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Further results of her witness came about three days after this, when one of the preachers met her on the street and asked her if she could get him some of those books; and she replied, “Sure, I can get you a whole carload, if you will read them.” So he got thirteen booklets and a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I found out he was a Russian Jew who had been converted to this so-called “Christian church”, so sent him the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Jews;</span><span class="font9"> and heard last week that he thought it quite a wonderful book. Mrs. B---- quit the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">church, and told me she was going to get some of those books in every Pentecostal home in —----. I thought this experience so out of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ordinary that you would be glad to hear about it. Of course I cannot begin to give this experience as thrilling as it really happened; so you will have to add the thrills to it yourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At this point I received some further information as to how Friemark, the Jewish preacher, received the books. He said, “This book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation</span><span class="font9"> is a work of art; and how I wish my people would read the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Jews!</span><span class="font9"> But they won’t.” If nothing more comes out of it, at least this bunch of preachers have been proved before their congregations to be a bunch of four-flushers and it sure has created quite a stir; and I am in hope that we may be able to get into the church of this Friemark and put on the judge’s talks over the transcription machine; we have been putting them on every Sunday in two of the biggest parks in the county, with very good results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“As a member of the 125th Transportation Corps, I was located at Bassens, France, after the armistice, our company having charge of the care and operation of the forty gantry cranes at the mile-long dock there. I helped unload 100 cases, twelve great gross in a case, of baby caps or bonnets. Just 2,073,600 baby caps, and they still were stored in the warehouse there when we left.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Brisbane wants to know who ordered the caps. Who can tell him ’ We do not know who ordered them, but we can visualize about how and where and when the ordering was done. Probably somebody with a baby-cap factory wanted a share in the money that was being thrown away all over the country for making the world safe for hypocrisy. A good feature would be to have some clergyman weep in the pulpit and tell his audience that all the babies in France had been slain by the Germans, and that France had no money to pay for baby caps for any new babies that should be born, and it was no more than right that to pay our debt to Lafayette we should furnish the caps for as many new babies as those that had been slain by the Germans, with some left over for good measure, and besides, it would give several months’ work to the baby-bonnet factory right in their own town. The results as listed by Mr. Brisbane were so good for somebody that it would have paid to hire a preacher to weep, and to pay him $100 a drop for every tear shed, and even to pay extra for the peck of sliced onions he would need to have with him in the pulpit to work up a good weep.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">T LAST the fatal news is out. The Honorable John D. Capitalism, who has been seriously ailing for a long time with a chronic incurable disease, has passed away. Capitalism, the omniscient, the omnipotent, the omnipresent, first cousin of the rock of Gibraltar, has given up the jolly old ghost and called it a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There has been so much secrecy surrounding the event, so much fear that the sun would cease to shine and the stars go on a strike if the truth were known, so much suppression of the news by those mighty institutions that are supposed to give the news, so much shuddering and whistling in the dark, that the exact moment of the old bastard's final snort is not yet definitely known, but as near as we can make out from the evidence at hand, it occurred on March 4, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On that day, according to those near the bedside, the, patient revived for a moment, asked for a shot in the arm, took a swift mournful look at one putty-faced Hoover who was preparing to go on a fishing trip ('?) and otherwise scurrying for cover, and another hopeless look at one complacent Roosevelt who had recently been sentenced to the presidential chair, rolled his eyes in a wild spasm of agonized desperation, fell back on his pillow with a final gasp that had much the sound of a razzberry, and passed out of the picture. Came the dawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One Roosevelt, it is said, when apprized of the death, could not believe his ears. (After a long experience in Tammany politics, one can hardly believe anything.) He was unwilling to think that the worst had hap-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">circulatlns on the Pacific coast)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">pened, but was nevertheless very much alarmed. He took a quick look around and saw the money-changers fleeing from the temple with their brief cases and their Rolls-Royces and their trucks and their private yachts filled with gold and currency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Ha!’’ came a doughty dictatorial voice. “I see what's the matter. The financial gangsters have put the old geezer on the spot and are going to take him for a ride. If that’s all there is to worry about, I'll soon put a stop to it, for I'm a guy that ‘does things’, even as the whirling dervish. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the wizard of Washington put an extra padlock on the banks, which were already closed so tight that nobody could get anything out except the insiders and favored depositors, and told the ship scuttlers to come back to errin’ with their gold, for he would protect them. And then he made a few other magic dictatorial passes, even as Mussolini might have done had he possessed the same amount of intelligence or what have you, smiled blandly and thanked the people for their magnificent cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, alas, it appears, on further evidence, that all this well meaninglessness was too late. Witch-doctor Roosevelt, although he had been urgently called in consultation four months before, was too slow in marshaling his wonderful remedies and mixing his esoteric potions. There had been so many yachting and other outing trips to take, and so much political pie to cut, that he simply couldn’t be bothered with more important considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, however, contrite and willing to make amends, he evinces a certain nobility in his refusal to give up hope, but in spite of generous blood transfusions from the public treasury, in spite of extensive skin grafting from the most noted skin-game specialists of all time, and in spite of highlj^ oxygenated hot air injections from the trusty newspapers, the stiffening corpse refuses to be resuscitated, and even acts as if it were glad the ordeal were over. Well, why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As much secrecy has surrounded the cause of Sir John D. Capitalism’s demise as has enveloped the fact itself. Not until the autopsy can be completed and the report agreed upon and signed by the wiseacres, can we be sure of what turned the trick. The symptoms certainly indicate a large number of complications. Some say he died of a hardened heart and fatty degeneration. Some aver he died of poor circulation leading to torpid liver, gallstones, swelled head, acute indigestion, nearsightedness, overnourishment, underconsumption, arthritis, too much sugar and albumen in your’n and not enough in mine, etc. Some say he overtaxed his resources, while others say he undertaxed his mentality. Some say that he worried so about his debts and his family that he committed suicide, and cite that on several previous occasions he would have jumped out of a window if he could only have found a window big enough and high enough. Some say that it was an inside job on the part of frenzied financiers who had become so frenzied they didn't know what they were doing. Some say it was those naughty bolshevists. And some solemnly' assert that a fresh young Technocratic lad by the name of Howard Scott, who is known to the police and nearly everybody else, walked up and delivered such a well-directed, scientific blow in the solar plexus that the pompous old windbag was so flustered he suffered a stroke of apoplexy and went into a tailspin. Curses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the cause and manner of death can wait. It may be months, even years, before the autopsy is complete. And so at the moment we are a nation of bewildered relatives and friends, to say nothing of enemies, talking in subdued tones in the next room to that where the carcass, all that remains of a once haughty imperialist, lies stretched out, its temperature going steadily downward even though stringent regulations have been issued to prevent speculators from selling its temperature short. We attendants at the wake run the gamut all the way from sincere mourners to unbridled gloaters, and each is trying to comprehend what has happened in the light of his own interest and intelligence, if any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mourners have much reason on their side, for old John D. Capitalism, in spite of his many faults, not the least of which was inordinate gluttony, was as bluff and hearty an old scoundrel as any pirate Morgan that ever sailed the financial main or any King Henry VIII that ever beheaded a wife for criminal syndicalism or you know what. In his better moods he was not at all unattractive. He certainly had a way with him and knew how to wear his evening clothes, golf togs and other regalia. Carefully posed in the back seat of his luxurious town ear, he has been able to impress many a keen sociologist with his importance. He has been admired and loved. In the World War many millions worked their fingers’ ends off and laid down their lives so that the land over which he ruled with an iron hand could become a great creditor nation that would never be able to collect what was coming to it. He knew how to be generous. He was generous with his real wives and his divorced wives, and still more generous with his mistresses. Even to strangers, he was often known to give away things he no longer wanted. No matter how much he might take away from you, he was always willing to give a little of it back (if his secretaries would let you get to him). Have you an appointment ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If he didn’t give anything else, he was always willing to hand out advice, freely and fully. Of course it is hinted that he often received payment in devious ways for advice which was ostensibly free. But why go into that? He certainly believed in thrift. Not only was he willing to save his own money, but he would also save the money of anyone who would deposit with him, so safely in many cases that they never saw it again. He couldn’t bear to see people hoarding what belonged to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though short on culture, he was not a bad conversationalist. Even on one cocktail he could give a splendid imitation of having ideas and knowing what he was talking about. He was particularly good at describing golf shots and singing smile songs. In his most bibulous moments he was fond of telling about the terrible effect of alcohol upon the morals of the working man. But this is not to be understood as making him out a hypocrite. Oh no! Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, it must be confessed that the gloaters also have much reason on their side; for in his more forbidding moods he was nothing more than a crude, coarse, arrogant, conceited, unmoral, immoral, ruthless, conscienceless son of a lousy soandso. He would not only lie and steal and cheat widows and orphans while pretending to be their friends, but he would do worse: he would even hire rascally corporation lawyers to keep them from getting back at him, corrupt legislatures to give his thieveries an absolving cloak of legality, scare poor little anemic and academic economists into scattering fog until nobody could make head or tail of it, subsidize newspapers by advertising and otherwise into misrepresenting the facts, and wheedling servile, sanctimonious underpaid sky-pilots into calling down the blessing of god upon his sacred form of piracy. Blessed are the apologists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oh yes, it cannot be denied that the gloaters have much right on their side, maybe fully as much as the mourners, but it is really not a time for either mourners or gloaters. Both arc useless. It is the time for calm, unemotional level-headed practical men to muddle through and carry on. In earnest workaday fashion we must first go about the necessary preparations for the funeral. The cadaver must be quickly put away to save us from the terrible stench that has already begun to pour forth from its more putrid organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When that is done, we must stay patiently on the job day after day, for the details connected with the settlement of an estate of such magnitude arc almost limitless. First we must make an inventory of what Sir Capitalism has left us. Fortunately our faithful statisticians have already made pretty complete inventories, and these, therefore, we have but to scrutinize in our task of apportioning and disposing of the estate. And, of course, it is too early to say whether the assets exceed the liabilites or vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We do indeed find that he left behind many things of unquestionable value, such as a wonderful sun that will continue to rise and set on schedule time even though its rays may be obscured from time to time by much needed rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find he left behind a great bountiful earth, rich in natural resources, mines, waterfalls and fertile land from which the necessities of life can easily be secured. These must go to the people for the use and benefit of all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find he left behind vast industrial plants and organizations capable of transforming these natural resources into commodities at a rapid rate. These must be conserved and, if they have been idle, reconditioned and put to work for the use and benefit of all the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find many millions of unemployed which Sir Capitalism had no use for though they are willing and anxious to become part of a properly functioning society and lend their ample skill and talents to the forces of production and distribution. These must Ijc reinstated so that they may be self-respecting and profitable members of society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find vast quantities of finished products suitable for sustaining life and giving happiness to human beings, already neatly stored in our granaries and warehouses. These must be apportioned to the people, all rightful heirs of Capitalism, each according to his need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find efficient transportation facilities which must be freely used to remove these stores of goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find many other worthy things, cultural and spiritual, some of them temporarily in abeyance, during the latter years of Capitalism's irascible senilitude. These must be preserved and reinstated and disseminated broadly for the use and happiness of the people, many of whom have fought, bled and nearly died for mere pittances under the rule of the old buzzard. In short, we find a land of plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, we find many, many things which are not desirable and must be discarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find a banking system that is bankrupt. This must go. In a land of plenty, there is little need for keeping accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find a bankrupt insurance system. This must go. In a land of plenty, insurance is an absurdity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find many cesspools of cities, and they too are bankrupt. These must be cleaned up, aired and in many cases scattered to the four winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find slums that must be destroyed, ugly useless office buildings that are no longer needed. They must be razed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find huge mountains of debt, taxes, mortgages, bonds, stocks, deposits, which must be repudiated. They are all unjust, but whether unjust or not, they must be repudiated. Those people who are unjustly treated by this process will be taken care of in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find millions of real estate speculators, stock speculators and the like. All these must go. In a land of plenty with controlled production and distribution, there is no surplusage to gamble with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find hundreds of thousands of lawyers eternally quibbling about property rights. These must go. In a land of plenty where there are no property rights except in consumable goods, these arrogant nincompoops are out of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find many thousands of adroit liars engaged in the advertising business. These must go. In a land of plenty, where science reigns, there will be no incentive to tell anything but the truth about a given product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find myriads of fathead politicians, stodgy owlish judges, and inhumane jailers. These must go. In a sane land of plenty, politicians must give way to statesmen, judges to human beings, and jailers to nurses and psychologists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We find millions of people who do not even pretend to be of any social service (goodness gracious! the very idea is preposterous!), but, by the device of getting hold of stocks and bonds and mortgages and other things which were formerly called securities, they expect to live entirely from the labor of others without thought of the social welfare except so fax’ as it reflects back upon their own comfort. All these must go. Dear, dear, what a pity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yes, all these and many others who are doing socially useless work must go. But where? The answer<sup>1 </sup>is simple. For those who can work, work must be furnished. They must do what is found to be their proper share of useful needed labor. Those who are incapacitated, either by age or infirmity, must be promptly and liberally pensioned. In a land of plenty none need be stinted. What will surprise many of those is that they will Ire happier than ever before, for the chief cause of unhappiness, economic uncertainty and fear of poverty, will have been removed. As for the rest, the chronic bellyacher and incurable mortgage hawks, let them go on scowling to the end or jump out of a convenient window if they prefer death to a life of ease in a land of plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Classification of Foods </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster (California')</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">F</span><span class="font9">OODS arc classified for the arrangement of correct combination; as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acid fruits</span><span class="font9"> (Class 1, which class also includes sub-acid fruits and sweet fruits). When the rules for combination are given, which follow, the &quot;acid fruits'’ rule will refer only to the &quot;acid<sup>-</sup>’ and &quot;sub-acid’’ groups of fruits. Class 2 includes all the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">non-starchy</span><span class="font9"> vegetables. Class 3 includes the group known as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proteins.</span><span class="font9"> Class 4 is made up of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">starches.</span><span class="font9"> Class 5 refers to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sweets</span><span class="font9"> (which may include some of the sweet fruits, and is listed for the purpose of combination). Class 6 includes all foods of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fat</span><span class="font9"> class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rule of Combinations of Foods</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Acid fruits,</span><span class="font9"> listed below in the Fruit class under subhead (A) and subhead (B), and all other </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sour</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acid</span><span class="font9"> foods, do </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> mix with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">starches </span><span class="font9">(Class 4); but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font9"> mix with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proteins</span><span class="font9"> (Class 3), meats, dairy products, and fats, but not with vegetable proteins, as most of those contain some starch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class 1. Fruit</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">(A)</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"> Acid Fruits.</span><span class="font9"> Oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, pomelo, are all classed as citrus fruits, and may be used together. Other acid fruits: Citron, pineapple, guava, strawberries, loganberries, cranberries, loquats, tamarinds, kumquats, tangerines, mandarins, nectarines, pomegranates, tomatoes (classed as a vegetable but considered as in the same class with acid fruits when arranging combinations).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(B)</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"> Sub-Acid Fruits.</span><span class="font9"> The fruits in this class contain, as a whole, less acid than do those in class (A), especially in their ripe state. If they are acid, then observe the “acid fruits” rule of combination. Sub-acid fruits are: apples, apricots, mangoes, blackberries, raspberries, cherries, currants, gooseberries, huckleberries, blueberries, mulberries, varieties of grapes, peaches, persimmons, plums, muskmelons, cantaloupe, casaba,Persian melon, watermelon, fresh prunes, fresh figs, plumcots.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">(C)</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"> Sweet Fruits.</span><span class="font9"> Mission figs, black figs, muscat grapes, raisins, dried prunes, bananas, plantain (similar to a banana), carol), litchi, guava, feijoa, dates. The dried fruits may be prepared by soaking them in water for a few moments or, if hard, for a few hours or by cooking them slightly. Do not throw away the water, as it is a good laxative. Never add sugar to the dried fruits, as they contain their own natural sugar. The dried fruits are to be used mainly when fresh fruits are not to be obtained. They can be safely combined with starches. They arc high in nutritive value, but not as cleansing as the fresh fruits.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">The avocado is one of the finest fruits known, and will combine with practically all fruits and vegetables. It is nourishing and laxative, and takes the place of meat, as it has some protein. It is very fat, and is to be avoided if liver and gall bladder are not in good condition. It can also be used in place of butter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class 2. Non-Starciiy Vegetables</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These, listed below, combine with all classes of food, with the exception of tomatoes, as they are acid and follow the “acid fruits” rule of combination and do </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> combine with starches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Non-Starchy Vegetables</span><span class="font9"> classified: This class of vegetables includes celery, spinach, New Zealand spinach, cucumbers, Italian squash, chayote, celery root, beet tops, turnip tops, small beets, turnips, carrots, and parsnips. Lettuce (plain, rodan and romaine lettuce), okra, oyster plant, salsify, zucchini, mallow kale, endive, vegetable marrow, parsley, ripe olives, New Guinea butter bean, mustard greens, chicory, sorrel, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The vegetables in the following group are supposed by most authorities to be less easily digested than those in the preceding group: French artichokes, Brussels sprouts, small peas, small mushrooms, cauliflower, dandelion greens, kohlrabi, small pumpkin, rutabaga, Swiss chard, sauerkraut, water cress, onions, garlic, chives, leeks, cabbage (raw), radishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tomatoes are one of the best foods known, containing the most vitamins of practically the entire vegetable class. Follow the “acid fruits” rule of combinations; that is, do </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font9"> mix </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acids, </span><span class="font9">like tomatoes, with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">starches.</span><span class="font9"> They are best used with proteins, non-starchy vegetables, and especially avocado. They balance fats well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Non-starchy vegetables are laxative, energizing, and exceedingly cleansing. They are the one class of foods that can be used by almost every sick person, regardless of such person’s condition, whereas starches and sweets and fats are frequently contraindicated. Proteins frequently must be limited, especially meat proteins. And even though fruits are the most healthful and most cleansing of all foods, they must be limited in some cases for a time until</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the body is able to stand their eliminative properties and their purifying action. In such cases vegetables start this action and make it possible for the body to rebuild itself and reduce the hyperacidity to the point where acids can be tolerated. Acid fruits are actually alkaline when introduced into the system, though they may produce a temporary irritation to people who are already very toxic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class 3. Proteins</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This class consists of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dairy products,</span><span class="font9"> such as milk, cheese (preferably cottage cheese or Philadelphia cream cheese), buttermilk, clabber custards, junket, and other dairy products, jello, and eggs, as well as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">meat</span><span class="font9"> proteins (lamb chops, rabbit, chicken, lean beef, turkey, mutton, Belgian hare); most fish products (fresh fish, such as sole, sand dab, sea bass, black bass, pickerel, fresh cod, trout, etc.); </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">nuts</span><span class="font9"> (pine nuts, pecans, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachio nuts, hickory nuts; less desirable are walnuts, peanuts, cashew nuts and acorns, as they contain a greater proportion of starches and do not lend themselves as readily to the rule of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">protein</span><span class="font9"> combination).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Proteins</span><span class="font9"> combine with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fruits</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">non-starchy vegetables;</span><span class="font9"> not so well with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">starches</span><span class="font9"> (as the digestive juices that are formed by the stomach that render protein fit for digestion are in excess for the digestion of starches, which causes them to ferment, and protein digestion is then interfered with. Proteins are the tissue-builders of the body; but if eaten in excess they produce acidosis. They should be eaten very moderately after the age of 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class 4. Starches (all bread and flour products)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Choose mainly those made of dark flour, and cereals made of whole grain, dark or whole rice, potatoes (bakedpreferable), large carrots, beets, and parsnips, Hubbard squash, succotash, hominy, Lima beans, navy beans, green corn, sweet potatoes, Jerusalem artichoke, cassava (tropical sweet potato) tapioca or cassava starch, yams, sago (taken from the sago palm) tapioca and sago are more or less demineralized and are not among the most valuable starches. Mushrooms, truffles, lichens (Iceland moss), and agar-agar (known as Japanese gelatin) are also classed as starches. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Starches</span><span class="font9"> combine best with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">non-starchy vegetables</span><span class="font9"> (except tomatoes, which are acid). They can also be used with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sweet fruits; never</span><span class="font9"> with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acids,</span><span class="font9"> and best not with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proteins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class 5. Sweets</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sweets combine with practically all other foods, but are best used with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">proteins</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">non-starchy vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class 6. Fats</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fats are contained in all seeds of plants, and found in most animal food, as bacon, etc., and in olives, most nuts, all oils, avocado, etc. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Fats </span><span class="font9">combine best with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">non-starchy vegetables</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">acid fi uits,</span><span class="font9"> and fairly well with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">starches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Poor Little Baby Mother!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">rpi</span><span class="font9">IE </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nursing Journal</span><span class="font9"> of India reports the birth of a baby weighing 4 pounds 3 ounces at the Victoria Zenana Hospital, Delhi, the mother in this case being herself a baby girl less than eight years of age. The child was a full-term child and the mother is able to nurse it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">MOSQUITO has six fine needles with which it can suck up blood, but only the females attack humans. It is said that one of the reasons why the Roman Empire fell was that the mosquitoes spread malaria. In Siam 50 people are killed annually by tigers, while 50,000 are killed by malaria.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">X AMERICAN physician has discovered that the brain of a busy man needs much more sugar than other parts of the body. The same man needs 100 percent more sugar when he is busy than when he is at rest. Studying 300 people, and examining the blood flowing into the brain and out from the brain, he discovered that much of the sugar was lost in transit. The blood in arms and legs was found much less laden with sugar.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience Gives Boldness to the Diffident</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font9">T IS true, as a matter of course, that the Creator has the absolute right to demand perfect obedience of every creature, and it is true, as a matter of fact, that every one who will gain eternal life must come to that state of perfect obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Can we say that it is any harder for one person to be obedient than it is for another? A person with much self-assertiveness has much self-confidence to aid him in carrying forward, and enduring whatever may come. It is easier for a diffident person to receive a command, but harder for him to face the issue. The one has too much confidence; the other, too little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God is the author of the laws that have produced all the interesting types of minds with which we come in contact. He makes use of now one type and now another for the work He has in hand. Naturally, He selects according to suitability. ‘God hath set the members in the body as it hath pleased </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Him.’—</span><span class="font9">1 Corinthians 12:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is manifest that the prophet Jonah was a chosen vessel to the Lord. It is not unlikely that he was the only man of his generation that could have performed the task that was given him to do, and which he accomplished. God could have raised up somebody else, but, as the Master Workman, He used the in strument which He had at hand, the one best adapted to His purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For reasons which we now clearly discern, but which must have been very hard for Jonah to comprehend, this timid, shrinking Israelite was ordered to leave his homeland, and go to the then capital city of the earth, a heathen city at that, and a city that had been unfriendly to his people, and to deliver to them a message from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is deeply significant that the name Jonah means “Dove’’. It well describes this gentle, timid, shrinking, inoffensive man who dreaded the publicity that would be attendant upon his acts if he were to go to the capital and proclaim against it. The story shows that he reasoned that God would accomplish His purposes anyway, and did not need him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>He Tried to Evade the Issue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">There have been plenty of people since Jonah’s day who have tried to do what he did, when he undertook to go on a business trip so as to avoid doing the work which he knew Jehovah God wished him to do. Instead of going to Nineveh, he took ship for a destination which may have been either Spain or the relatively near-by city of Tarsus. More likely it was the latter, as a regular rate of fare existed between the two points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He probably thought that if he went on this business trip Jehovah God would select some other person to make the announcement to the Ninevites, and he would get out of doing an errand which to a person of his temperament would be peculiarly unpleasant. He seems to have thought that as soon as he left the Holy Land, the one land in all the earth over which Jehovah God exercised sovereignty, the issue would be settled and he would be at peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord was not in the least surprised by this act on Jonah’s part. He knew he would do it, and knew what to do to help him to make up his mind to be fully obedient. The record says that “[Jehovah] sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[margin, </span><span class="font9">thought] to be broken”.—Jonah 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To be in a great storm at sea is to be in the midst of one of the most terrible but at the same time one of the most fascinating things in life. One feels that his only hope of life is in the soundness of the good ship beneath his feet. If he thought that was in danger<sup>-</sup> of going to pieces it would be enough to make the stoutest heart quail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sailors on that boat told about that storm for the rest of their lives. The little ship stood first on one end and then on the other. It lay over on one side and then turned away over and lay on the other. It plunged headlong down into yawning chasms of the deep, and every time it went down it looked as if this plunge would bo the last. But each time the stout old prow hit the oncoming wave it rose to the occasion and went up a mountain of water as steep as that it had just slid down, only to go quickly down into another whirling vortex, and so on and on.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Jonah Enjoyed the Excursion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Jonah had something bigger to worry about than a storm at sea; he had just had a narrow escape from doing the hardest thing he had ever been called upon to do, but now that they were out of Joppa harbor he would just go to bed and forget all about it; he would sleep it off. The sea was rough, but it only made him think of the big cradle in which his mother used to rock him to sleep. In no time he was in dreamland, fast asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But while Jonah was taking it easy down below decks, the captain and the sailors were in the worst storm they had ever been in. They thought the ship was going to break up, in which case probably all would be lost. They began heaving the cargo overboard, so as to get the big leak up above the water line. It seemed no use. The storm got worse and worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The shipmaster, fearing the worst, decided to call all hands, and, coming upon Jonah, shook him and said, “What meanest thou, 0 sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.” When all hands were on deck, as was the custom of the times, they cast lots to see whose fault it was that they were in jeopardy. The angel of Jehovah God was there supervising the lot, and it fell upon Jonah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jonah’s moral courage was equal to the occasion. lie told the shipmaster the plain truth, who he was, what he had been commissioned to do, and how he had tried to escape his duty, now, he perceived, all in vain. He admitted that the great storm was on his account; that it had been sent by the great Jehovah God, Creator of the sea as well as of the dry land, whom he feared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The account shows that the sea grew more and more tempestuous. The captain and others were afraid, not merely of their own fate, but with genuine kindliness of heart they asked Jonah why he had thus been disobedient to the One whom he recognized as the time and only God, and what he thought they must do with him in order that the lives of all on board might he saved.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Jonah Benevolent in Face of Death</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Jonah’s response to these solicitous inquiries commends him to all. Believing that there was no hope for himself, and unwilling that innocent men and women should be drowned on his account, he expressed the positive conviction that if he were thrown overboard the storm would cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under the circumstances this was tantamount to suicide. A selfish man would have poohpoohed the idea that he was in any way responsible for the storm, and would have urged unceasing efforts to navigate the boat till the waves closed over it. It is very apparent that Jonah had a good heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But the shipmaster and sailors had good hearts, too. They saw Jonah’s hopelessness, and his resignation, and tried to save his life along with their own; but it was all in vain. At length they too despaired; for the record shows that the sea meanwhile grew ever more and more tempestuous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fully convinced that Jonah had told them the truth, these brave men finally cried out to Jehovah God: “We beseech thee, 0 [Jehovah], we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, 0 [Jehovah], hast done as it pleased thee.” With that they took up Jonah and cast him into the sea; and the sea ceased from her raging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How different the language and the spirit of these heathen men from that of the heartless gangsters of our day, who would have turned the machine gun on him right where he stood, without a moment’s hesitation; or the strongarm squad that adopts the most ruthless tactics with the most innocent people in the world, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jonah’s faithful witness to these men, even though it had been the witness of his own disobedience, was not without' result. The record could have ended right there, so far as the men on the boat were concerned, but God has seen fit to preserve in the record that after Jonah had been heaved overboard “the men feared [Jehovah] exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto [Jehovah], and made vows”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus, even at the moment of what he thought to be death, Jonah, by his faithful adherence to the truth, had borne a good witness and had honored Jehovah’s great and holy name. Surely, surely, the faithful spirit of Jehovah’s witnesses is not altogether lost upon the police officials and magistrates before whom they stand in moments when all seems lost, and in a better age we shall doubtless have some records of the sayings and doings of these men, among themselves, preserved for us, and shall know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>To Jonah All Seemed Lost</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">When Jonah went overboard it was probably night, for he was asleep when called. The storm was of God’s own making; therefore as severe as the ship could stand. Jonah reasoned that he had been unfaithful to Jehovah God. No doubt to him this was the end of all things; he might as well die and be done with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And then, 0 thou great and good God, at just exactly the right moment along came His divinely provided life-preserver, a living one, too, big enough to provide quarters for Jonah for three days and nights while he tried to figure things out. Most life-preservers cover but a portion of the body. Jonah’s covered him all over. He was as safe in there as he would have been in heaven, though possibly not as comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We spend little time discussing the anatomy of the “great fish” that Jehovah “prepared” to entertain the prophet. A great fish similar to the one caught near Miami, and exhibited all over the United States, could have done it easily enough. Orca (“killer”) whales more than sixty feet long have been seen stranded at Algiers in the Mediterranean; sperm whales have been seen in its waters; sharks thirty feet in length have been found containing the bodies of men whole and entire. Any of these could have taken care of Jonah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is one credible instance of a sailor’s being swallowed by a whale and recovered alive after several hours in the whale’s belly. The digestive juices of the whale affected his skin, but he lived for years and was otherwise unharmed. Details of this were published in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> some years ago.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Jonah Had Plenty of Time to Think</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">Instances are on record where sea creatures have been swallowed by sea monsters and have eaten their way to life and liberty. Jonah could not very well do that, and, besides, even if he could have done it, his life-preserver would be gone, and the moment he got to the outside the water would rush in and he would be drowned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No, there was nothing for him to do but lie there, with the seaweeds wrapped about his head, and think the thing all over. There were no electric lights. It was warm enough, but it was close, awfully close. It was terribly wet and sloppy. The teeth pointed inward; they had mercifully spared him coming in, but he did not see how he was going to get by them on the way out, or indeed, for that matter, how he was going to get out at all. The way he put it was, “The earth with her bars was about me for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And then Jonah got to thinking about God, and what a fine thing it would have been if he had been obedient, instead of making a fool of himself. And Jehovah God, the true and glorious and wonderful God, inclined His ear and listened, and forth up from the deep came that pitiful little cry broadcast to Him from the belly of the great fish, and He heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jonah does not tell us all he said, but no doubt he started out by telling the Lord that he was sorry, genuinely sorry, for the way he had acted, and, said he, and we have this part of his prayer, “They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of [Jehovah].”—Jonah 2: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jonah thus told God that it was a lying vanity, a false pride, that had kept him from going down Nineveh’s main street with the message of the hour, but if in His mercy He would let him out of his prison or life-preserver (whatever one might wish to call it) he would be most happy to go on the errand to Nineveh, his voice would be a voice of thanksgiving; he would pay to Jehovah God the vow that he had long ago vowed; he would be obedient, true and faithful. Jehovah could deliver him from even such a ridiculous plight and take him from the belly of the great fish.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>No Change in Jehovah</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">There was no change in Jehovah; He was the same all the time; but there was a big change in the prophet Jonah. He was still dove-like, still modest, shrinking, bashful, diffident, but he had had a bellyful of having his own way, and meantime the big fish had also had a bellyful of Jonah. What was this indigestible thing, anyway, that was short-circuiting his digestive apparatus </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And then “[Jehovah] spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land”. There is nothing said about Jonah’s washing up, and washing and drying his garments, and locating some ripe and luscious fruit in the place where it would do the most good. Those things would be provided as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But as soon as the exigencies of the situation were provided for, ‘the word of [Jehovah] came unto Jonah the second time, saying [just what it said before], Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I told you to preach, when I mentioned this to you before.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And did Jonah go? Did he? You could not see him for the dust. Were his excursion to Tarshish and his three days’ rocking around in the belly of the great fish lost on him? Not so that you could notice it. Probably the digestive juices of the great fish made his skin look like that of a leopard. He was a sight to see, and a messenger to listen to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Anyway, he went down the main street of the then greatest city of the world, and he had no more than entered the place when, with all the earnestness of a man snatched from the jaws of the tomb, he began to proclaim his message that Nineveh must repent within forty days or be destroyed. He probably thought it would not repent, and would be destroyed anyway.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Jonah’s Mission a Complete Success</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">The thing did not turn out the way Jonah thought it would, but it was nevertheless a complete success. Quite likely his simple narrative of his own personal experiences in the ship and in the great fish, and his personal appearance, his deadly earnestness and his expressions of gratitude to the Creator, were the deciding factors. At any rate, here is what happened, and we commend it to the attention of the president of the country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with .sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water: but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.—Jonah 3: 5-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is noteworthy that when Jonah was down in the belly of the great fish he said, “I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple” (Jonah 2:4), and, also, in his reminiscences he says, ‘‘When my soul fainted within me I remembered [Jehovah]: and my prayer came in unto thee, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">into thy holy temple.” </span><span class="font9">—Jonah 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">We Quote from the Book “Prophecy”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At this point we quote from Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font9"> a paragraph from the subtitle “Assyria” which links the whole thing up:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophetic books of Jonah and Nahum arc devoted exclusively to Assyria and Nineveh, its capital city, and strikingly foretell a state of the Devil’s organization in which a political class will be in the saddle and adopt and follow a false religion because it is thought expedient in carrying out the political purposes. In this the political factor is strongly and consistently supported by the commercial power, the “giants”, which together with the politicians are made the principal ones of the flock of the religious system. The prophetic record concerning the Assyrian world power seems to clearly foretell a condition of the Devil's organization existing during the period of preparation and immediately before the great conflict between Satan's organization and God's organization. Otherwise stated, it foretold a condition existing on earth when approaching the time of the establishment of God’s kingdom, which is the present time.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font8"> page 145.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are not discussing at this time whom Jonah represents, but from the foregoing it is plainly manifest that he represents those entrusted with a warning, rebuking work to the great politicians ensnared in the Devil’s religious systems in the interim between the Lord’s coming to His temple and Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let us each make the personal application to ourselves. When the great Jehovah God gives me a message to the rulers of this world, will I try to dodge the unpleasant and unfavorable publicity ? Will I try to get out of going straight down the main street of Nineveh and telling all, right and left, that they must repent and turn to God or perish ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It may suit the flesh very well, for a time, to make business an excuse. But what kind of excuse is our own petty private business as compared with the great business of Jehovah God, the business of setting up the Kingdom in the earth, and serving notice on the rulers that they must repent or quit?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But we need not suppose that any of us shall have the experience of miraculously escaping from the sea, as did Jonah. More likely, if we are swallowed up by the sea of commerce we shall be swallowed up by it for keeps. Many are thus swallowed up and thereby lose all their privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God found a way to help Jonah overcome his diffidence, but we ask you to put yourself in Jonah’s place. Don’t you honestly think that he would have had a much better time if he had gone to Nineveh in the first place? And if he had been sufficiently in earnest about it, it is possible that his original message would have been as convincing as the one that he actually gave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Obedience brings boldness as a cure for diffidence ; of course it does. But since diffidence is nothing more nor less than the fear of man, is it not just as veil, nay, much better, to be obedient in the first place, and thus spare oneself such inconveniences as those to which Jonah was subjected? Let everybody make whatever choice he thinks best.</span></p>

Those that did not respond quickly were kicked into submission. The haul netted the thieves about $500 per head for each person held up. All wires were cut.

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE desire to do something for the unemployed has started off in grand style a work of reforestation badly needed. Work has been planned which it is calculated will provide 1,314,900 man months of labor. It includes construction of forest telephone lines, fire breaks, range fences, forest highways and minor trails, clearing away of fire hazard rubbish, erection of fire protection structures and administrative buildings, control of insect pests and blister rust, improvement of public camping grounds, and the planting of new forests and thinning of old ones. It is known that work of this nature actually repays in dollars and cents the investment in it. This will require 250,000 men, who will get not to exceed $30 per month and keep, and be expected to stay on the job for at least one year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font9">N AN address over radio station WOL, Edward F. McGrady, American Federation of Labor legislative representative, referring to conditions of distress in the world's richest country, said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Our investigators have found as many as five, people sleeping in one bed. They have found three families living in a tenement of three small rooms. Thousands of infants have died because the mothers, suffering for months from hunger and malnutrition, could not give these infants proper nourishment. Our hospitals are overflowing everywhere with the victims of this depression. Insane asylums are disgracefully overcrowded. Mass poverty and despair are the order of the day. Local relief has almost completely broken down. Twelve months ago cities that were able 1o contribute $15 to $20 per month for a family of five have cut their relief to $S and $10 per month and in six of our large industrial sections they areallowing only fift.v cents per week to feed a human creature. This makes no provision for housing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">OMEONE who has a quantity of inferior food he wishes to dispose of seems to have found the Civilian Conservation Corps at Camp</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Big Springs, Glenburn, California. At least that is the inference we draw from a letter signed by forty-nine members of the company, which says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We are not getting anything fit to eat out hero. Last Friday we had for lunch one cheese, one meat and one jam sandwich. The meat was green as grass and there were worms crawling on top of the cheese, and no jam in the jam sandwich, and tonight we had meat we couldn’t get close enough to to eat because it smelled so bad. Our chow is either burned or raw or so rotten we can't eat it/’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark300"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark301"></a>A Hard-pressed Sleuth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">TN SAN FRANCISCO a Federal narcotic sleuth, anxious to make a showing for the big wages he receives from the government, saw a colored man come out of a drug store with three capsules of quinine. He jumped to the conclusion that here was a narcotic peddler; so he handed him $2 for two of the capsules, and then arrested him. When the Negro was brought into court he did not know what it was all about, and the report of the chemist showed that he told the truth. The sleuth should be given a blue envelope. He is probably depressed by the reports from Washington that seventy-one sleuths have been let out of the Department of Labor because it was found they were spending plenty of money but accomplishing next to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Police Quell Riots They Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">P</span><span class="font9">OLICE in various cities have shown remarkable ability in quelling riots which they have themselves caused. In Washington, D. C., a group of unemployed wanted to present their grievances to the district commissioners. The police refused to grant them a permit. President Roosevelt said he saw no reason why their request should not be granted, and so notified the commissioners. The commissioners and the police stood pat and refused to allow the demonstration. But the unemployed made their demonstration anyway, and 150 massed policemen, armed with clubs and tear gas guns, had no difficulty in quelling the riot they had caused. One man with a baby in his arms was knocked to the pavement. The policeman who did it could have felled him if he had had a baby in each arm.</span></p>
