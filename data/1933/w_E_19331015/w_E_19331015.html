The special period over, report work promptly to the office supervising your territory. Those not under a branch will report direct to this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pursuant to the provision of law and the charter of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, notice is here given that the annual business meeting of the said Society will be held at Pittsburgh, North Side (formerly Allegheny), Pennsylvania, at 10 o’clock n.m., Tuesday, October 31, 1933, at which the usual annual business will be transacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“PREPARATION”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With deep gratitude to Jehovah, by whom all the sons of Zion are taught through Christ Jesus, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> here announces a new book bearing the above title. Its stirring contents give the fundamental explanation of each chapter and verse of the book of Zechariah and its relation to the cleansing of Jehovah’s sanctuary. The beautiful binding and embossed cover befit what is inside. A special edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font2"> containing the author’s letter and autograph, will be available October 1, at 50c a copy.

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SHEPHERDS AND STAVES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>11</sup> And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, 0 poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beatify, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.”—Zech. 11: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH is the Great Shepherd, and Christ Jesus is the Chief Shepherd of God’s covenant people. Those who follow faithfully in the footsteps of Jesus and advance to unity with Christ are made under-shepherds. When one occupies a place of shepherd or teacher amongst God’s covenant people, and becomes arrogant, austere, selfish and hypocritical, he is a false and wicked shepherd, and is so designated by the Lord. (Ezekiel 34; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 222) Such false shepherds are at first in three classes, but finally all end up in one class and go into the same place. These counterfeit shepherds must be gathered out from amongst God’s people preparatory for the battle of the great day of God Almighty. They must be assigned to their proper place. Jehovah reveals to his remnant the true condition and the course he takes that the remnant may understand and may be made strong in the Lord. With the shepherds there are associated the principal of the flock and others subject to them. Jehovah caused Zechariah to prophesy concerning the stronghold of “Christendom”, and of the counterfeit or false shepherds and also the principal ones of their flecks, that are behind the doors or strong bars of Satan’s organization, and to say: “Open thy doors, 0 Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.” (Zech. 11:1) In chapter ten, verse ten, of Zechariah’s prophecy, Lebanon is used to picture Jehovah’s righteous kingdom, but in Zechariah 11:1 Lebanon is used ironically and pictures that hypocritical class which pretend to be God’s people but which in fact are of the synagogue or organization of Satan. These have to make themselves safe in their own strength, which is pictured by their fireproof doors; but such protection will not save them when the time comes for the execution of Jehovah’s judgment. The cedars of counterfeit Lebanon are the mighty ones in Satan’s organization and, of course, are not built into the temple. These mighty ones dwell in the high peaks of Satan’s visible organization. (Amos 2:9) The time comes when the Lord breaks these cedars as a strong man breaks a toothpick, and concerning which his prophet wrote: “The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars; yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.” (Ps. 29:5) Zechariah prophesies concerning “Christendom” here in particular, and Ezekiel prophesies of the fire that shall destroy it.—Ezck. 20:45-49; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, pages 269-271.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Trees are used to symbolize creatures. The fir and cedar trees are of the same tree family and are used to make ships for the commerce of the world and to make instruments of warfare. The figurative fir tree and figurative cedar tree are closely allied. (Ezek. 27:5; Nah. 2:3) When the one falls the other mourns; hence the prophecy of Zechariah is: “Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled; howl, 0 ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.” (Zech. 11:2) “Oaks of Bashan” also represent mighty ones that are enemies of God and hence are a part of Satan’s organization, all of which in due time must come down. (Ezek. 27: 6) “Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.” (Amos 4:1; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 1932, page 117) Idols were made of the oaks of Bashan. (Isa. 44: 9-14) Idolatry was practiced under the oaks. (Isa. 1:29; 57:5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font3"> Hos. 4:13) These oaks more particularly are representative of the Devil’s religion employed as a camouflage to hide the deeds of other parts of his wicked organization. Devil religion is practiced under the shade of Big Business, that is, the mighty “oaks of Bashan”. Pharaoh of Egypt and his supporters that ruled and oppressed the people are likened to the lofty cedar for whom there is great mourning when he falls. (Ezek. 31:2, 3,16) The prophecies indicate that Satan’s organization will fall in sections, one after another, and that mourning follows the fall of each. “Christendom,” which is chiefly in the Anglo-American imperialistic system, claims to bear the vintage of the kingdom of God, and hence that she rules by divine right. The cedar tree in Zechariah’s prophecy here, therefore, seems to refer chiefly to “Christendom”. “Christendom” rejected the kingdom of Jehovah and took the Devil’s substitute and labeled it as ‘the represent a-tive of God’s kingdom’. Since then “Christendom” has become “the defenced forest” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(marginal reading), </span><span class="font3">or, “the inaccessible forest” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Both.),</span><span class="font3"> by reason of her armaments, and she is called ‘security against war’ by reason of her peace pacts and like provisions. The fire of Armageddon shall devour the whole system, including Satan, the chief “cedar”, and the war-axe of Jehovah’s great Chopper is now ‘laid at the root of the forest’.—Matt. 3:10.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">307</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The false shepherds in “Christendom” have been the chief ones to practice religion and act as instruments to blind the people to the truth. In consideration for their hypocritical work the other portions of Satan’s organization have fed these shepherds; and when their meal ticket is taken away they will set up a great howl. They are hirelings of Big Business, and feed out of the hand of their masters; and when they have to hustle for their food, like others, they will certainly cry. Hence the prophet says: “There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled; a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.” (Zech. 11: 3) When they see their pastures being spoiled they begin to howl, and their howling is already to be heard. (Jer. 25:36) Zechariah says: “Their glory is spoiled.” In all other places in the Scriptures the Hebrew word here rendered “glory” or “majesty” is rendered “garments, mantle, or, robe”. These false shepherds wear a peculiar kind of garment, mantle or robe, and by this means have attempted to identify themselves as God’s representatives and have thereby been able to cast a spell over the people and cause the people to treat them with awe and much respect. But this prophecy shows that such ‘ ‘ magic spell ’ ’ produced by these clergy gentlemen is rapidly disappearing. (See Ezekiel 34; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 222; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font3"> pages 18-23.) Resolutions widely distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses have exposed these false shepherds and have already spoiled considerable of their glory; but the Lord tells that he has much more in store for them and he will completely spoil them. The prophecy in connection with these shepherds mentions the ‘ roaring young lions’, and manifestly these he used to picture the professional politicians that have used the clergy as a shield or blind for their crooked work; and when they lose their fat jobs and prestige they 'become hungry because thereof, and they howl and roar like a young lion seeking something to satisfy his hunger. “The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.” (Ps. 34:10) “Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.” (Ps. 91:13) These young lions roar, “for spoiled are the proud banks of the Jordan.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> This seems to refer to the time when the opportunity for the witness work of Jehovah’s people is at a high stage, and results in spoiling the pastures of the proud, which is pictured by the spoiling of the proud banks of the Jordan. (Jer. 49:19; 50:43,44) The spoiling seems to have begun with the pouring out of the sixth “vial”, in 1927. (Rev. 16:12) The “young lions” and the religious politicians have been roaring and pawing the dust ever since. Some of these “young lions” are to be found amongst the directors and operators of radio who try to determine that the people shall hear only what their allies in Satan’s organization shall speak.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> It is God’s flock of which Jesus is the principal sheep, and which flock is led “to the slaughter”. (Isa. 53:7) It is to Zechariah, representing Christ and his brethren, that Jehovah now speaks: “Feed the flock of the slaughter, whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say, Blessed be the Lord; for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.” (Zech. 11:4,5) To the same effect the apostle Peter was directed to write: “Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.” (1 Pet. 5:2) Satan’s servants, the clergy and “the man of sin”, sell the weaker of the flock to the procurers, that is, the ruling factors, who therefore wrongfully have such in custody. For a long while these procurers have abused, falsely accused and slaughtered the poor of the flock of God. By another prophet the Lord speaks of this wicked crowd that swallow up the needy, and pictures them as saying: ‘When . . . may we make the measure small [that is to say, to cheat], and the shekel great, and falsify the balances by deceit? that we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.’ And then the Lord says to them because of their wicked works: “Surely I will never forget any of their works.” (Amos 8:4-7) These oppressors and slaughterers of God’s people “hold themselves not guilty” of wrongdoing, because the religious false shepherds tell them that it is a good work that they do against God’s humble people. Like obedient hirelings, they are not willing to bear any burden of the sheep, but because of their selfishness they connive at the destruction of God’s flock. The “man of sin” class engage in selling the flock of God and at the same time hypocritically assume to be doing God’s service when they say: “Blessed be the Lord; for I am rich.” This is the same thing that the Lord shows the lukewarm as saying. (Rev. 3:17) Haman sold the Jews to the Persian slaughterers; concerning which Esther said: “We are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed.” (Esther 7:4) Many of the “elective elders”, who mingle with God’s flocks, refuse to join in the protest against Satan’s organization, and refuse to bear the kingdom message of comfort and deliverance to the people. It is this same self-important “elective elder” class that claim to shepherd the flock of God, but who do not; but, on the contrary, become party to the enemy’s action in destroying the flock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The day has come when the people must take their stand for or against Jehovah, because it is the day of vindication; and therefore, by his prophet, Jehovah says: “For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.” (Zech. 11: 6) The inhabitants mentioned in this verse of the prophecy are the ruling elements and their supporters who do not receive the ‘mark in their forehead’; and the Lord will not have pity on them. (Ezek. 9:4-10) They have been unmerciful, and shall not obtain mercy. (Matt. 6:14,15; 18: 32-35) The Jonadab class are marked in the forehead, but those who do not sigh and cry for righteousness or seek the Lord are not marked. The Lord delivers this latter class into the hand of his King, Christ, and the members of his militant organization, pictured by Jehu, who shall smite “Christendom”, and nothing shall be permitted to deliver them out of the Executioner’s hands. In vain their gold and silver will be able to deliver them. (Ezek. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7:</span><span class="font3">19; Zeph. 1:18) Not even those like Noah, Daniel or Job could deliver the unmarked ones.— Ezek. 14:16,18,20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“BEAUTY” AND “BANDS”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> The prophecy of verse seven following specifically applies after the holy spirit, as an advocate, ceases to function as a comforter and helper of the consecrated; and therefore the application is after the Lord Jesus, as the antitypical David, appears at the temple and takes charge of God’s flock. From that time forward he feeds the flock of God. “And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.” (Zeeh. 11:7) The prophet here says: “I fed the flock”; meaning, of coui'se, that what he does is as the representative of Jehovah. The flock is Jehovah’s, and includes all the “poor in spirit” who take their stand on the side of Jehovah. First are those who are in the covenant for the kingdom, and then, in their turn, the “great multitude” and the Jonadab class are fed. Jehovah is a great Shepherd, and he employs his beloved Son, the good Shepherd, to feed his flock; and therefore Zechariah here pictures Christ Jesus, “the good shepherd.” (John 10:14) Christ Jesus at the temple is feeding the flock of God direct, and in this work he employs the faithful members of his body.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> In feeding the flock Zechariah, as the Lord’s representative, says: “I took unto me two staves.” Those were such as the shepherd boy David carried when he went out to engage Goliath in battle. (1 Sam. 17: 4043) In this prophecy the two staves pictured the two covenants of Jehovah, made with those who have called upon his name and who have, by implication or directly, entered into the covenant with him. One of these staves is called “Beauty </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[margin,</span><span class="font3"> Graciousness; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.,</span><span class="font3"> Grace] ”, and pictures the everlasting covenant “made with all the people”. (See verse ten; Gen. 9:1-6,16,17.) The everlasting covenant had the beautiful symbol of the rainbow, and was and is a covenant of grace or graciousness in this, that Jehovah promises that a flood shall never again curse the earth. The other stave he called “Bands [Binders, or, Union, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin] ”, and it pictures the covenant with Judah or the house of David for the kingdom, upon which the brotherhood of Judah and Israel was based. (Verse 14; Gen. 49:8-10) “Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.” (Zech. 10:4) “For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph’s.” (1 Chron. 5:2) “Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they anointed David king over Israel.” (2 Sam. 5:1, 3) They were all in a brotherhood for one king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’During the operation of the holy spirit as advocate and helper, and while the two covenants were in good effect, Jehovah could deal with those of “Christendom” who had become parties to the covenant;’but the time must come, and has come, when “Christendom” breaks the covenant and God is no longer under obligation to perform the covenant on his part, as appears from verses ten and fourteen following in this prophecy. Zechariah at this point in the prophecy foreshadows Christ Jesus in direct touch through his angels with the flock of God, to protect and feed the flock and to rule the enemy. Christ Jesus is shown as having come out of the antitypieal Bethlehem, and stands and feeds his flock in the strength of Jehovah, in the majesty of Jehovah’s name. (Mie. 5:2,4) He does not feed those who have broken the covenant, but he is shepherd only for all who seek the Lord, and particularly feeds his faithful remnant. “And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.” (Ezek. 34: 23) “And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. And I will set up shepherds [the remnant, as representing the good shepherd, Christ Jesus, because in full unity with him] over them which shall feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the Lord. ’ ’ (Jer. 23: 3, 4) The Lord will no longer use the selfish and ambitious “elective elders” to attend to his flock, but uses those who are “born of God” and ‘taught of him’ and who walk humbly before the Lord, giving praise to his name. “And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.”—Jer. 3:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> All false and unprofitable shepherds God cuts off from his flock in order that the faithful may be prepared and fully equipped for his service. Such false and unprofitable ones are divided into three classes, to wit: (1) the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition”; (2) the clergy, both modernists and fundamentalists; and (3) the “elective elders” who have assumed to be overseers of the flock of God, but who fail and refuse to obey God’s commandments and to feed upon up-to-date truth which Jehovah has provided for his own. On the contrary, these selfishly feed themselves and stubbornly and willfully take a lawless course. Concerning this point the prophet says: “Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me.” (Zech 11:8) Christ Jesus, after coming to the temple, proceeds with this work of ‘cutting off’, or ‘sending off’ (Ro?A.). The “one month” is a brief period in which the rejected ones are cut off, and corresponds to the first month of the year, Nisan, the month in which Jesus appeared at the temple in the year 1918, when judgment began. All kingdom interests that had hitherto been in the hands of the three divisions of these false shepherds must now be taken away and given to the faithful ones. Concerning the “man of sin” class it is written: “Who is that shepherd that will stand before me? Therefore hear the counsel of the Lord, that he hath taken against Edom [the ‘man of sin’ class]; and his purposes that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman.” (Jer. 49:19, 20) As to the clergy, who are false shepherds, the Lord says: “And who is that shepherd that will stand before me? Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord that he hath taken against Babylon [the clergy of ‘organized Christianity’], and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans [‘Christendom’].” (Jer. 50:44,45) “I will render unto Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea, all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 51:24) As to the other division, the selfish “elective elder” class who assume to feed the flock of God, but who aet for their own selfishness, it is written: “Woe be to the shepherds of Israel [God’s covenant-people] that do feed themselves ! ’ ’—Ezek. 34: 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">“Ultimately they all come into one class, of whom Jehovah says: “Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter.” (Isa. 56:11) When Jesus appeared at the temple for judgment he began there the cutting-off work, at which time, says the prophet, “mine anger was kindled against the shepherds.” (Zech. 10:3) He proceeded from that time forward to send away the workers of iniquity, the “evil servant” class. (Matt. 13:41; 24:50,51;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hos. 5: 6, 7) These false shepherds show their hatred of God, and the Lord God abhors them. The three divisions of the shepherds named do not love the appearing of the Chief Shepherd, Christ Jesus, when he appears with all his angels with him at the temple; and therefore there is nothing for them. The “crown of life” is laid up for those who love the appearing of the Shepherd. (2 Tim. 4:8; 1 Pet. 5:4) The selfish ones have not received “the love of the truth” and are gathered out from the kingdom.—Ezek. 34:10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> There is a company of people who willingly follow after the false shepherd, to wit, the “man of sin” (2 Thess. 2:10,11); also a company of the principal ones of the flock of organized “Christendom” led by the clergy; and also those who give heed to and follow after the selfish “elective elder” class which opposes the work of the Lord after his coming to the temple. To all such the Lord, by his prophet Zechariah, says: “Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.” (Zech. 11: 9) The wicked refuse to heed the warning that is given them, and the Lord permits them to die; and their blood is upon their own heads. (Ezek. 3:19) Others of this false shepherd class are cut off by the sore sword, and still another division by the famine, symbolized by ‘eating the flesh of his fellows’. This is supported by the prophecies, as follows: Ezekiel 5:1-4,12; Jeremiah 15:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Zechariah the prophet is then caused to act out a picture disclosing the purpose of Jehovah, and this he does by the breaking of the two staves, Beauty and Bands. He first breaks the staff Beauty, symbolic of the everlasting covenant, because those in the other side of the covenant have already broken it. (Isa. 24:5; Gen. 9:1-6) Therefore Jehovah by his prophet here says: “And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people [peoples, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.].” </span><span class="font3">(Zech. 11:10) No longer can Jehovah in justice shepherd the eovenant-breaking flock with “Beauty” and “Bands”; therefore he has brought forth from his universal organization “the man child”, who is to shepherd all the nations with the scepter of iron.— Rev. 12: 5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.;</span><span class="font3"> Ps. 2: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah purposes to smite the earth with the worst curse of all time. (Mal. 4:5,6; Isa. 24:6) “Christendom” had repeatedly broken the everlasting covenant before the great climax was reached in 1914, when all “Christendom” engaged in the wholesale bloodshed in violation of the covenant and in maltreating and killing some of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. “Christendom” thus spurning and breaking the everlasting covenant, Jehovah is under no obligation to longer keep covenant with “Christendom”, and the breaking of “Beauty” symbolizes the breaking of that covenant completely. “And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord.” (Zech. 11:11) It was in “that” day that Jehovah must bring up the subject of the covenant and declare it broken, that it might be known by those who give heed to his Word that it was done by Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> The true meaning of the everlasting covenant was understood and published by God’s people first in 1927. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> December 15, 1927) The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font3"> first issued in August, 1928, gives a further explanation of the everlasting covenant, and, being publicly released, it constituted a notice to “Christendom” that “Christendom” in particular had broken that covenant. Those who are on the Lord's side know now by Jehovah's Word that he will settle the everlasting-covenant breakers at Armageddon, and that this will not be by conflict between the nations, but by the battle of the great day of God Almighty. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham’s</span><span class="font3"> rendering of the latter part of this text of the prophecy is: “ Then did the sheepmerchants who were watching me know that the word of Jehovah it was.” The visible rulers of Satan’s organization are likened unto sheep merchants, that is, buyers or possessors of the flock. (See Zechariah 11:5.) Within a few days after the release of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3"> in 1928 the rulers in “Christendom ’ ’ and other nations signed the Paris Peace Treaty renouncing war as an instrument for the settlement of international disputes, which peace treaty the clergy claim proceeded from the Lord. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus knew that such treaties were not from the Lord, but that the Lord had cast away “Christendom” completely.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> Zechariah then addresses these “sheep merchants” and says: “And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price [my hire, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.;</span><span class="font3"> my wage, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]; </span><span class="font3">and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.” (Zech. 11:12) In applying this prophecy primarily to Jesus, in his case the “sheep merchants” desired to dismiss him from having oversight of their flocks by putting him to death. Jesus resigned from further service to the “lost sheep” of Israel when he made the declaration recorded at Matthew 23:37-39. Judas, who posed as the representative of Jesus, was the treasurer, having the moneybag; and he secretly entered into negotiations to sell and deliver Jesus to the “possessors” (“sheep merchants”). In the case of Jesus thirty pieces of silver was the value of his service which these possessors placed upon it. Judas, being a thief and privately negotiating the deal, stole the money, or “wage”, that should have been paid into the hands of Jesus. (John 12:6) The price of the thirty pieces of silver was agreed upon between Judas and the purchasers (Luke 22:3-6), and thus the insignificant value which they placed upon Him! Now that the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” foreshadowed by Judas, has been revealed, will he do a like service for the “sheep merchants” before the time of Armageddon ? If so, this would show that company so doing as worthy of death.—Ex. 21:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> The notice that Jesus served upon Israel was that his service for them had ended. (Matt. 23: 37-39) In August, 1931, his true followers promulgated a resolution, designated a “Warning from Jehovah”, and this same message was broadcast over many radio stations and later sent by the millions to the people, and particularly placed in the hands of the “sheep merchants”; and this seems well to fit the resignation of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus from further connection with “Christendom” and its “sheep merchants” and false shepherds, and the further fulfilment of the prophecy of Zechariah 11:12. Among other things that resolution says: “We declare our allegiance is wholly to God and his kingdom, and we delight to be his witnesses and to bear his testimony to the honor of his name. Our faith forbids and precludes us from engaging in war or in any other enterprise that would work harm or injury to mankind. We are for Jehovah’s kingdom of everlasting peace.” This served as a resignation from further service or connection with “Christendom”. At that same convention a resolution was adopted in which God’s remnant took the “new name”, and which is notice of completely separating themselves from the organization' of their opposers. Such was equivalent to saying, in the language of the prophet: “Give me my price [or, wage].”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> The Jewish clergy did not value the blood of Jesus as precious, and so they set a price of thirty pieces of silver on his life. The clergy of today and their allies place no value on the work which Jehovah's witnesses are doing for the people to point them to the way of salvation and how they may escape the great trouble. Instead, they brand the work of Jehovah’s witnesses as commercial peddling or hawking. They set a very low value upon Jehovah’s witnesses; and what will be the price which the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,' ’ will agree upon for the delivery of these faithful ones ?—Jer. 12: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Summing up the matter, it now clearly appears that in A.D. 33 Jehovah sent his beloved Son, who was of priceless value, to Jerusalem, offering him as the Redeemer and King of that people. Under the leadership of the clergy and the principal of their flock the Jews rejected Jesus and fixed his price at thirty pieces of silver, took possession of him, and crucified him. In 1918 Jehovah sent his King of priceless value to “Christendom” and presented him as the King of the world, and “Christendom” rejected the King and kingdom and went fully over to Satan’s organization. Then Jehovah sent forth his faithful witnesses with the message of his kingdom, giving warning to all the world. This message the clergy and the principal of their flock have rejected, and have fixed the price of Jehovah’s message and messengers at nothing, saying to them in substance: “You are not worth thirty cents.’’ Jehovah says to “Christendom”: “What a great price you have set upon me and my message of goodness to you!” His faithful witnesses continue to deliver his testimony and, when done, report: “I have done as commanded.” Jehovah broke off relationship with Jerusalem and destroyed that city. He has broken off relationship with “Christendom” and will destroy that organization. These things were foreshadowed by the breaking of the staves Beauty and Bands. These things were written aforetime for the comfort of those now on earth who love Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> Jehovah is the Master of the Zechariah class, and therefore the price is Jehovah’s money. Hence the Lord directs Zechariah to prophesy: “And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prized at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.” (Zech. 11:13) Other translations of this particular prophecy read: “So I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them in the house of Jehovah, into the treasury” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)-,</span><span class="font3"> “unto the treasurer.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Looser)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah is “the potter”. Many scriptures support this conclusion. The potter is the one who forms or creates. “But now, 0 Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.” (Isa. 64:8) The same Hebrew word rendered “potter” is rendered “former”, “formed” and “fashioned”. (Gen. 2:7, 8,19; Jer. 1:5; Isa. 43:1, 7, 21) Christ and his body members were “fashioned” by Jehovah [formed by the Potter]. “Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.” (Ps. 139:16) Jesus is the chief understudy of the Great Potter, Jehovah.—John 1: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> In bargaining the price for Jesus the Jewish clergy really fixed the price of Jehovah and his service to them. (John 5:23) No wonder the Lord Jehovah ironically says, as stated by the prophet: “The magnificent price at which 1 had been valued by them!” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> This is ironically called “ ‘the precious price’ at which the divine care was valued”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Leeser,</span><span class="font3"> margin) How insignificant is this when compared with the language of the psalmist: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever;) that he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.” (Ps. 49:7-9) The taking of the silver by Zechariah and casting it to the potter does not exactly foreshadow Judas’ accepting the blood money. It was Jeremiah who foretold that. (Matt. 27:3-10) Judas cast the money down in the temple, the same place where Zechariah cast the money. Jehovah is now in the temple, and the receiving of the money from “Zechariah” bears testimony against those who do the pricing, and which therefore calls for the same action by the Great Potter against the “sheep merchants” who would have none of the service of Jehovah’s faithful -witnesses; and therefore, they having been warned, ‘their blood is upon their heads.’ (Eze!;. 3:19; 33:2-5) “Even so will I break this people, and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again.” (Jer. 19:10,11) Jehovah thus pictures the breaking of the “sheep merchants”. (See Ps. 2: 9; Isa. 30:12-14; Rev. 2:26, 27) The action of Zechariah in casting the money into the temple also seems to picture Jehovah's witnesses who have been priced by Christendom’s “sheep merchants”; and then Jehovah’s faithful witnesses submit their case to their heavenly Father, presenting before him the evidence and in effect saying: “I have done as thou hast commanded me.”—Ezek. 9:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Zechariah then broke the staff, Bands, or, Binders, which pictured the covenant for the kingdom. “Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.” (Zech. 11:14) The breaking of the brotherhood between the ten tribes of Israel and the tribe of Judah after the death of Solomon was due to their unfaithfulness to the kingdom covenant and to idolatry on the part of the reigning house of Solomon (1 Ki. 12:19-24; 11:4-13), and also to the refusal on the part of the ten tribes to longer submit to God’s will concerning the kingdom covenant. (Gen. 49:10; 2 Sam. 7:4-17; Ps. 89:3,4,35-37) Israel refused to be ruled by the house of David with whom the kingdom covenant had been made. Likewise in the fulfilment of the prophecy of Zechariah, the breaking of the covenant with “organized Christianity” is shown in the breaking of the stave Bands, or, Binders. Catholics and Protestants and others have assumed to be in the covenant to do the will of God and in the covenant for the kingdom. Those who form “organized Christianity”, so called, have broken that covenant by idolatry or Devil worship, making themselves a part of Satan’s organization, and by refusing to be submissive to the requirements of the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”, which refusal reached an emphatic climax in the endorsement of the League of Nations, in 1919, by the Church Federation. There they took a positive stand in opposition to Jehovah and his kingdom. These, together with all who have rejected the Lord Jesus at his coming to the temple, have broken the covenant with Jehovah, and no longer could he shepherd that rebellious flock. The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> deals fully with this matter. The time when Zechariah, God's faithful remnant, figuratively broke the staff Bands was at the adoption of the resolution on July 26, 1931, at which time </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication </span><span class="font3">and other like kingdom messages were published and served upon the followers of “Christendom”. The pouring out of the “seven last plagues”, from 1922 to 1928, did not move ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’ and other professed followers of Christ to repentance; hence the breaking point came in 1931. It was at that time that the remnant disclaimed all brotherhood relationship with those rejecting the kingdom, and this they did by receiving and adopting the “new name’’ which Jehovah gave them. The enemy has falsely charged Jehovah’s witnesses with changing their name for the purpose of deception. This is in keeping with the action of Satan’s organization. God himself gave the new name and foretold this long ago, and the faithful ones, as Zechariah did, merely carried out his will which he had long ago declared should be done. Thus receiving the new name, and breaking all relationships with those who oppose the kingdom, the faithful remnant submit their case to Jehovah, declaring themselves wholly for his kingdom and that they have nothing in common with any organization that has to do with Satan. (2 Cor. 6:15-18) After having broken the staffs “Beauty” and “Bands”, then the Lord commanded Zechariah to take the instruments of the “foolish shepherd [worthless shepherd, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]”. </span><span class="font3">(Verse 15) These instruments are the tools or equipment for service. The former holders thereof having forfeited their right to use them because of having become foolish, that is to say, perverse, and failing to perform their duties and obligations, such are not permitted on the “highway”, and their opportunity for service is taken away by the faithful ones. (See Isaiah 35:8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> This part of the prophecy applies to the “evil servant” class, “the man of sin”, described by Christ Jesus in Matthew 24:48-51; 25:26-30; Luke 19:24-26. “The fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.” (Prov. 11: 29) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of February 1 and March 1, 1923, specially called attention to the transfer of the kingdom interests or “goods” of the shepherd from the foolish to the “faithful and wise servant” class. It was then known by the remnant, the “faithful servant” class, that the Lord was at the temple; but the foolish servant rejected the truth, showing that the temple is not for them. The remnant immediately responded to take up the instruments that the Lord had taken from the foolish ones and to use them to his praise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> When called to the kingdom and when entering the Lord’s service, these shepherds were not then foolish, but they became foolish, worthless and of the idol-worshiping class at the close of the Elijah work, and others became foolish by following in their same course. The Lord had no further use for this ‘worthless servant’ class. Hence he caused Zechariah to prophesy: “For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off [that are hidden, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin],</span><span class="font3"> neither shall seek the young one [those that be scattered, K.V.], nor heal that that is broken [and the fractured will he not bind up, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.],</span><span class="font3"> nor feed that that standeth still; but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws [hoofs] in pieces.”—Zech. 11:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> It is the “great multitude” that are “hidden” or lost sight of in the prison houses, or church systems, and that need the message of the kingdom; and the foolish or worthless servant does not visit them. The “young” as to knowledge of God’s Word and its meaning are the “scattered” ones, straying among the organizations of “Christendom” and searching for what satisfies. The “fractured” ones are sueh as have sustained injury by contact with Satan’s organization. None of these the slothful or foolish are permitted to serve. “The weak will he not nourish.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> Those ‘standing still’, hence making no progress in knowledge, are the ones weak beca'ise of lack of spiritual food, convenient for them, and which they fail to feed upon. The slothful or foolish servant does not go from house to house with convenien: food in hand to teach the people concerning the kingdom, but, instead, opposes that which the Lord has provided. Like wild beasts, such as a wolf or a lion, they have attacked God’s flock, while serving themselves. Like a cat-faced animal, they mislead many by indulging in good words and fair speech to deceive the hearts of the simple, and thus they willfully feed their own bellies. From these the faithful must be entirely separate.—Rom. 16:17,18; Phil. 3:18,19; 2 Pet.’2:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> When the Chief Shepherd appears at the temple it is a time of woe for the foolish, good-for-nothing, worthless shepherds; hence says the Lord’s prophet: “Woe to the idol shepherd </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> worthless shepherd] that leaveth the flora! the sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye; his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.” (Zech. 11:17) The foolish servant becomes unprofitable, wicked and slothful. (Matt. 25:30) As an “idol servant” he is a thing of vanity and, like an idol, seats himself as a god (idol), claiming to be as God. (Jer. 10:8,15; 51:17,18; 2 Thess. 2:4) Jehovah commanded Ezekiel to prophesy woe unto such shepherds. (Ezek. 34:1,2; see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two) The prophet then tells the course of this foolish servant class, to wit: Those making up the ‘worthless servant’ class leave the flock of God as soon as they find out that they will not be permitted to boss the Society or organization of Jehovah’s sheep. Even before they withdrew themselves from the presence of God’s flock they were against his kingdom interests because of their selfishness, and in this condition the Lord found them when he came to the temple. They leave the flock and draw others away after them by speaking perverse things. (Acts 20:30) “These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the spirit.” (Jude 19) Beginning in 1917, and from that time forward, those who go to make up this worthless servant class have followed such selfish and wicked course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> The great Judge at the temple casts the wicked servant away. The sword which comes upon his arm (‘drying it up’, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.,</span><span class="font3"> margin) shall also be upon his right eye. The apostle warns that Jehovah and his Chief Shepherd bear not the sword in vain. (Rom. 13: 4) He expresses his sharp judgment against the “worthless shepherd”, and “his arm shall be clean dried up”. The arm, together with the hand, which is a part thereof, symbolically represents divinely provided equipment for service to the kingdom of God; and such, by the judgment of the Lord, is completely taken away from the worthless or “evil servant” class, and this is pictured by drying up. The “right eye” evidently means the best eye or means of seeing, and this “shall be utterly darkened”. This exactly fits the condition of the worthless servant class, the “evil servant”. Those of that class not only refuse to discern the Lord at his temple for judgment, but speak wickedly against those who are making known the fact that the Lord is at his temple. For them the temple does not exist, and hence the Lord does not reveal to them the deep things of his Word. (Isa. 42:9; 1 Cor. 2:10) Such is the effect of God’s sword, or swift judgment, upon them. Their understanding is darkened. (Rom. 11:10; Eph. 4:18; Ps. 69:23) The prophet therefore gives an exact description of the present-day condition of the “evil servant” class that opposes Jehovah’s witnesses in the proclamation of the kingdom message. “The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness.” (Eccl. 2:14; Matt. 6:22,23) With these disabilities mentioned by the prophet the “idol shepherd” is “worthless”; hence concerning such it is written: “Let him be unjust still.” (Rev. 22:11) The Lord casts such into outer darkness. (Matt. 25:30) The ‘worthless servant’ class must be gathered out and taken away from God’s faithful ones before the temple is cleansed, in order that the approved ones might be prepared for the use of the Lord and offer unto him an offering in righteousness.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>SATAN’S ORGANIZATION: BABYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE greatest prophet of Jehovah God is Jesus Christ, his only-begotten Son. When on earth as a man this greatest of prophets foretold and pointed forward to the events and conditions of our day as marking the end of the world or age in which Satan the Devil has been ruling over mankind. In the course of this prophecy on the end of Satan’s organization and the beginning of God’s kingdom Jesus said: “And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man, in heaven.” (Matt. 24:30) This “sign of the Son of man” is the vision of God’s universal organization of which God has made Christ Jesus the head; and this vision is revealed through God’s written Word to the faithful footstep followers of Christ Jesus who have responded to the heavenly calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s great prophet foretold another sign in heaven that would appear unto those of God’s temple class on earth. In the Revelation which God gave to Jesus to show unto his faithful servants on earth it is written: “And there appeared another wonder [or, sign] in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his* heads. And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.” (Rev. 12:3,4) This scripture is also a prophecy, and it is apparent that its fulfilment takes place at approximately the same time that the prophecy relating to the symbolic woman giving birth to the man child is fulfilled, as stated in the scripture. If that conclusion is correct, we should be able to find some facts showing its fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above-quoted prophecy discloses a great red dragon ready to devour the man child of the woman as soon as it is born. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon</span><span class="font3"> is one of the names God gave the Devil. It refers to Satan the enemy and all the wicked agencies which he employs. The color </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">red, </span><span class="font3">]jko unto fire, symbolizes that which is destructive. The meaning of the word “dragon” is ‘that which devours’. “Red Dragon” therefore represents the devilish and extremely wicked organization moving to devour and destroy God’s organization Zion and the symbolic man child, which is the new nation or government that shall rule the world in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore the conclusion is that the “great red dragon” in the prophecy represents Satan’s organization that is opposed to God’s organization. There is both a visible and an invisible part of Satan’s organization, because Satan is a spirit creature invisible to human eyes. The number </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">seven</span><span class="font3"> (which was the number of the dragon’s heads) is a symbol of that which is complete and invisible, while the number </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ten </span><span class="font3">(which is the number of the dragon’s horns) symbolizes that which is complete and visible to man. The two numbers, being divinely symbolic numbers, therefore represent the complete organization of Satan, both invisible and visible. The “seven crowns” upon the dragon’s heads represent the complete power and authority that is exercised over his organization, and which is invisible to human eyes, and also that the controlling power of the great organization of Satan is invisible to man. “Ten horns” is a symbol of complete dominating power over all the nations of the earth. Jesus told his disciples that Satan the Devil is the invisible ruler of the world and is opposed to him. (John 14:30) Paul, an apostle of Jesus, gave similar testimony, calling Satan “the god of this world”.—2 Cor. 4:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Satan’s organization invisible is divided into and operated by departments under subrulers, is quite reasonable; and the conclusion is supported by the Scriptures. We know that is true with reference to the visible part, and the visible part always reflects that rule by which the invisible is governed. In addition to this, the prophet of God mentions the ‘ ‘ prince of Persia” and the “prince of Grecia” that opposed the angel of the Lord and therefore represented the Devil. (Dan. 10:13, 20) This would indicate that the Devil has appointed an acting prince over each nation or earthly division of his organization. Paul tells of these “rulers of the darkness of this world”, and that they war against the members of God’s organization. ■—Eph. 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many have been deceived concerning Satan and made to believe that he does not amount to much, and that he was bound long ago, and that he has no organization. Many have also been induced to believe that Satan has horns and hoofs, and carries an asbestos poker with which he stirs the fires of his inferno and tortures the creatures who fall into his clutches. Satan himself is authority for all such fantastic lies which his agencies use to confuse the people and to blind them to his real course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptural proof is that Satan is a subtle, wily, elusive, fraudulent, hypocritical and very deceptive enemy of righteousness. He represents himself as an angel of light, and covers his deadly lies with a little truth, that he may deceive the unsuspecting. (2 Cor. 11:14; 2 Thess. 2:9) So subtle are his methods that he has induced many good Christian people to believe that he has nothing to do with the present world governments, and comparatively few have ever seen and appreciated the fact that he has a powerful organization. Therefore it appears to be both important and necessary to set out here the proof concerning his organization, its inception and development, and its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That which moved God’s beautiful son named Lucifer to rebel and become Satan, the enemy of God, was coveteousness. He desired to have an exalted throne above others of creation, that they might bow and worship him even as creation bows before the throne of Jehovah and worships him. He set about to complete his organization, both among the spirit creatures and among human creatures. On earth he organized men into religious s;stems. Then he organized the commercial power and supported it with a military arrangement, and then a political organization. He saturated the entire organization with a religion. The leaders in the commercial and political parts of his organization he made the principal ones of the flock of the religious part of the organization, and thereby formed a combination of all three parts. Babylon well represents the religious, Assyria the political, and Egypt the commercial factor of his powerful organization. In the world powers that succeeded these three named above, the three elements, the commercial, ecclesiastical and political, are always prominent and appear as the governing factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Babylon was founded by Nimrod, who was the son of Cush, who was the son of Ham. The first book of the Bible says: “And the beginning of [Nimrod's] kingdom was Babel, and Ercch, and Aecad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.” (Gen. 10:10,6-9) The name “Nimrod” means “rebellious, or him that rules”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cruden)</span><span class="font3"> Nimrod left the land that had been assigned to his father Ham, and invaded the land assigned to Ham’s brother Shorn in the northern regions, and settled in the land of Shinar. In this Nimrod manifested the covetous and rebellious snirit of Satan. It seems fitting that, when the time came for God to send faithful men into the promised land of Canaan, he called Abraham and brought him away from the country controlled by Satan through his agencies. He took Abraham out of the very birthplace of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Babylon or Babel is, according to the native etymology of the word, spelled Bab-il, and means “the gate of God”. The Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ba-bel</span><span class="font3"> means “confusion”, and the reason why God applied this name to Bab-il is stated in the Biblical record in these words: “Therefore is the name of it called Babel [or, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">confusion]</span><span class="font3">; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.” (Gen. 11: 9) It is also called Sheshach (Shi-shaki), the name of the moon god. The city of Ba-bel w<sup>T</sup>as built by Nimrod (the rebellious) for the manifest purpose of making a name for others than for Jehovah the true God. (Gen. 11:4) The fact that the city was given the name Bab-il (Babylon) is proof that it was built in defiance of Jehovah God and was the enemy organization from its very inception. It was thus named in derision and in defiance of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures show that the deity of the rebellious city was the god named “Bel” (Isa. 46:1; Jer. 50: 2; 51:44) Authorities, such as Doctor Strong, state that “Bel” is a contraction from the name “Baal”, which means master, husband, god or lord. Jehovah is the Lord God and “husband” of his people and his organization. (Isa. 54:5) Satan, otherwise called Bel or Baal, was and is the husband and lord of his organization on earth, set up with Nimrod as its visible head. Nimrod became the husband of his own mother. Therefore Satan created and married Babylon his organization. AU the acquisition by Satan was the result of his covetousness. Addressing Babylon, Jehovah says through his prophet: “O thou that dwellest upon many waters [that is to say, peoples and nations], abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.” (Jer. 51:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah named Satan the Dragon, which means de-vourer or one who swallows up; and thus Jehovah identifies Bel (Baal) as Babylon's god, and the city or organization of Babylon as the Devil’s organization which devours others.—Jer. 51: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Baal-worship was the established Devil religion. The devotees worshiped the Devil, even as he had designed that they should do. (1 Ki. 16:31-33; 18:19-40) “Religion” was the most prominent part of the organization of the city of Babylon. The manifest purpose was to get the minds of the people turned away from Jehovah and to induce them to worship the Devil and his creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to one authority, the name Bel means “the eonfounder'and he suggests that Babylonians worshiped Bel, and not Jehovah, as the eonfounder of the human language. The confounding of the language or speech at Shinar at the time of the building of the tower of Ba-bel resulted from the wrong-doing of Satan and his agencies; and therefore Satan is properly called a eonfounder. Satan has confounded the religious belief and practices, and has blinded the people to the truth. God speaks through his prophet against the Devil and his organization, and commands his faithful witnesses on earth in these words: “Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bel is confounded.</span><span class="font3"> Merodach is broken in pieces. ’ ’—Jer. 50: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These prophetic words foretold that the time would come when the base “eonfounder” would himself be confounded and this would be when the almighty God Jehovah would dash in pieces the great enemy organization Babylon and also its god which is Satan. This message of deliverance for the peoples of earth must be published to the ends of the earth by those who are anointed to be his faithful witnesses on earth. This message is even now being proclaimed, and soon Jehovah will accomplish his great act to the eternal praise of his name and word and power.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>KINGDOM FOLLOWS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font3">F A RIGHTEOUS government had at any time in the past been established on earth, and if the people had accepted that government and put forth their best endeavors to keep the law thereof, could they have received the blessings promised by the Lord God ? The answer is, No. The reason is, All people of earth were imperfect and therefore sinners because of the inherited imperfection resulting from the sin of Adam, the father of the human family. All were under condemnation. They were not convicts, as has been suggested by some students of the Bible. Only Adam was tried before the Lord in the garden of Eden and was convicted. Thousands of years later</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>RANSOM SACRIFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">the Jews had entered into a covenant with God and had failed to keep it. But all the human race stood disapproved before God, because they are imperfect. God cannot approve an imperfect thing. The word “condemn” or “condemnation” means to judge adversely. God must judge all men adversely, because all are descendants of Adam and therefore all are imperfect. Such disability was not because of any direct act on the part of the individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even the faithful men named in the Bible, such as the patriarch Abraham and others of like faith, could not receive the promised blessing. They put forth their best endeavors to obey the Lord, but, as the Scripture says, “these all died in faith, not having received the promises.’’ (Heb. 11:13, 39) The apostle Paul states why they could not receive the blessings; he says: ‘ ‘ God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” In this scripture the word “us” refers to the new creation which God brings forth, namely, Christ Jesus and the church. (Heb. 11:40) That the whole human race stood disapproved of God, because of sin, is made clear by the following Scriptural statements: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” (Ps. 51:5) “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”—Horn. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All being born sinners, therefore standing disapproved or judged adversely by Jehovah, it follows that some provision must be made to remove this disability before the blessing could come. Neither the new creation nor a righteous government could remove that disability and bring an everlasting benefit to the people. There must be a great sacrifice for sin, and this sacrifice must be one exactly equal to the perfect man who had sinned in Eden. The law of God provided that there must be ‘a life for a life’. (Deut. 19: 21) God’s law is just and must stand. There can be no deviation therefrom. God had sentenced Adam to death because of his willful infraction of his law, and that judgment must be enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the imperfection of all mankind resulted from that judgment, there must be a provision made in harmony with God’s law to remove this disability before the promised blessing could come. Consistent with his law Jehovah could permit another man equal to Adam to willingly take Adam’s place in death, and thereby provide for the removal of the disability standing against all of Adam’s offspring. The very terms of the divine law clearly imply that sueh could be done, when it is written: ‘ A life shall be given for a life. ’ But in all the earth there was no perfect man who could meet this requirement of the law. It is written: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.” (Ps. 49:7) The reason therefor is because all were the descendants of Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Was the promise of God then to fail because there was no man to meet this legal requirement ? No; for the reason that in the exercise of his wisdom and loving-kindness God made provision to meet this very emergency. In his Word it is written: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.” (Hos, 13:14) This promise of God to redeem man from death and ransom him from the power of the grave must be kept, because God’s Word is always kept. (Isa. 55:11) It is at once apparent to the student that the great pivotal point of Jehovah’s arrangement for mankind to get life everlasting on earth is right here. Then might we expect the pictures foreshadowing God’s arrangement to foreshadow this point also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font3"> That marvelous provision for the great ransom and sin-offering for and in behalf of man is foreshadowed, and is recorded in the Word of God. Such pictures or shadows were made by Jehovah by the use of his chosen people, to enable the honest and faithful seeker for truth at this time to understand God’s great purpose. With the understanding thereof the Christian sees that God in truth is love, and that he has made ample provision for blessing all the families of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has long been the practice of clergymen to arrogate to themselves the sole ability to interpret the Scriptures. They say that anyone of his own efforts can bring about his own salvation. Their argument is that Jesus was a great example to men, but that there is no efficacy in his shed blood. These men, by their false philosophy, have destroyed the faith of many in the Word of God, and have been used by the Devil to blind men to a most vital part of the divine purpose with reference to the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophetic pictures which God made in dealing with his servants on earth show that Jehovah God foreshadowed a “seed” or offspring, which is the new creation of God and in which all the families of the earth shall be blessed; he also foreshadowed the establishment of a just and righteous government for mankind. But before these could come into existence and function the great ransom sacrifice must be performed and the offering be made for sin. This is so clearly set forth in the Scriptures by pictures foreshadowing the great ransom and sin-offering that there is left no room for doubt. As one sees it he greatly rejoices at the manifestation of the unselfishness of Jehovah God in providing a way for man’s salvation. Not only has he provided therefor, but he permits the honest seeker for truth now to look back upon what God caused to be done centuries ago, and see the majestic forward movement of the unfolding of the great divine purpose. The student now, with keen interest, will examine the pictures foreshadowing the great ransom and sin-offering, which follow in succeeding articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the fountain of life. (Ps. 36:9; Deut. 30:20; Job 33:4) He is the great Life-giver, and he alone can rightfully take away life. If life is transmitted by one creature to another it is done only by virtue of the fact that God has delegated such ppwer to the one transmitting life. Life means existence, including the right to exist. The human race has existed for some time but has not had the right to life and therefore has not enjoyed life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first man, Adam, when created, had life, because he existed and had the right to exist, which right he received from Jehovah. No one but Jehovah could deprive him of that right. Had he been obedient to Jehovah he would have continued to possess that right to life. God had fairly warned him that the infraction of the divine law would lead to his loss of life. Adam violated the law of God, and the right to life was taken away; and in due course Adam ceased to exist. Only the righteous have a right to life. From the time the judgment was entered against Adam he was unrighteous. Thereafter his offspring came into existence; and since Adam could not transmit the right to life, his children were born without the right to life or to existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man’s greatest desire has ever been that he might enjoy life in its fullness. Being burdened with a disability by reason of sin, and having no ability to obtain life by his own efforts, the vital question for man is, How may man get life in the fullness thereof? The question was answered by the beloved Son of God, Jesus; and his answer was recorded by the prophet David, who foreshadowed Jesus and who wrote: “Thou [Jehovah] wilt shew me the path of life.” (Ps. 16:11) Later Jesus, for the benefit of mankind, said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without some knowledge of God’s provision for everlasting life man could not receive life everlasting. It is written: ‘Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. ’ (Rom. 6: 23 ; 5:18) It is impossible to receive a gift at the hand of another without knowledge of the author of that gift. It is impossible to obtain everlasting life without knowing God and his way to life. Why then waste time with the theories of men concerning life, put forth by clergymen wise in their own conceits? Such theories are worse than useless. The truly wise man seeks to know God’s way and then to obey the rules of that way. For this reason God has made provision for the salvation of men, and provision to bring to man the knowledge of the truth thereof, to the end that man might exercise his privilege of accepting the way that leads to life. When he learns that God has provided a way to give him life, and that he can have it by acceptance and obedience, then when he begins to obey he starts on the way to obtain that which he desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All men are imperfect and therefore have difficulty of understanding. (Heb. 5:11,12) In addition thereto Satan the Devil has hindered men from understanding the truth, and the first essential to understand is an honest and sincere desire to know God and his way for man. To aid man to understand, God has made pictufes foreshadowing coming events. These pictures are not a part of the divine purpose, but they are object lessons showing the outworking of his purpose. These pictures are beneficial, because, first, they instruct the seeker for truth, and, second, they establish faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures state, “Without faith it is impossible to please [God],” because in no other way can one learn of the way to life. (Heb. 11:6) “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. ’ ’ (Rom. 10:17) In other words, a man must have knowledge, and this knowledge must come from the right source; and the Word of God is the right source ; and there is none other. The man must rely upon that true knowledge in order to have faith. The loving-kindness of God has provided the means whereby one who seeks the truth may obtain it and grow in faith.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WHO SENT THE WISE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">M</span><span class="font3">ATTHEW, an apostle of Jesus Christ, wrote of “wise men from the east”; just how many of them he does not say. Traditions of men fix the number as three. Matthew merely states the fact that they came to visit the new-born king. He does not explain who really put it into their minds to hunt up the holy child. For many centuries religious instructors have given the people to understand that it was God, the Father of Jesus, who notified these “wise men” of the birth of his Son and who guided them to “where the young child was”. But does such an understanding of this episode square with what the Bible has to say? and have gullible people permitted themselves to be fooled? Let us see!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When it was announced to Mary by the angel that she should bring forth a child whose name should be called Jesus and that he would be the Savior of his people, Satan recognized this promised and unborn babe as the one who would ultimately bruise his (Satan’s) head. In the book of Hebrews, chapter two, verse fourteen, the apostle Paul plainly states to us</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>MEN TO BETHLEHEM?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">that God sent Jesus into the world, one of his missions being ultimately to destroy the Devil. The enmity of Satan toward the seed of the divine promise has never abated. Learning of the promised birth of the child, Satan at once began to lay his plans for its destruction. He attempted to induce Mary’s espoused husband Joseph to put her away and cause her to be put to death under the terms of the Mosaic law; but God prevented this by advising Joseph through his messenger in a dream to fear not, but to take Mary for his wife. The brief account of this, in Matthew’s gospel, chapter one, verses eighteen to twenty-four, reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together [in marriage], she was found with child of the holy [spirit]. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example [that is, by having her stoned to death on the charge of adultery], was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary tliy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the holy [spirit]. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call hi5 name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. . . . Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As to the so-called “star”, popularly called “the Star of Bethlehem”, this must be said: Stars do not move about the canopy of heaven in such manner as to lead men. It seems unreasonable that Jehovah would have made a star move from the east and stand over Bethlehem. However, Satan and his emissaries, the demons associated with him, have power to produce lights; and many instances are cited in history of these lights appearing near the earth. The “star” cr light that guided the wise men was without doubt such a light, and not a star moved by the power of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wise men residing in the cast were sorcerers and magicians. They were star-gazers. They were followers of the false religion. As the apostle Paul describes it in First Corinthians, chapter ten, verse twenty, they sacrificed to and worshiped the Deiil. For example, there was Pharaoh the king of Egypt who was a type or prophetic picture of Satan the Devil; and Pharaoh used wise men in the day that Israel, the Jewish nation, was in Egyptian bondage, these wise men of Pharaoh being like unto these messengers who visited the young child Jesus. These wise men were devotees of astrology and demon worship. Doubtless many of them were sincere, but they were the dupes of a false religion inaugurated by Satan. The Biblical record definitely fixes the fact also that lierod, then ruler in Jerusalem, was a wicked man, under the influence of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The record, in Matthew, chapter two, verses one and two, reads: ‘‘Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.” Be it noted that these wise men went directly to Herod, a representative of Satan. If the star guiding them was sent by the Lord Jehovah, why would he guide them to lierod, a representative of Satan, and a mortal enemy of the babe Jesus? If the sole purpose of the star was to guide these men to the place of Jesus’ birth there was no need for them to go to Herod at all. The reasonable answer, then, is that Satan had prepared a great conspiracy with the object of destroying the babe. A conspiracy is a design to commit a wrongful act in which two or more join in committing the act or some part of it. Sometimes persons arc involved in a conspiracy and participate without knowing the real purpose of the one who forms the conspiracy. Such may have been the case with these wise men; but without doubt Satan had formed and directed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When these wise men came into the presence of Herod, he was troubled, because he feared the new king would interfere with his reign, and, as the record reads, he ‘‘gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people [those who, according to Jesus’ words in John's gospel, chapter eight, verse forty-four, constitute the seed of Satan and also his representatives on earth] together, [and] demanded of them where Christ should be born”; in other words, he demanded to know where the babe Jesus could be found. Then Herod, in furtherance of the conspiracy, privately consulted with these wise men. &quot;We now see Herod manifesting one of the characteristics of Satan, namely, deception, in this, that he pretended to desire himself to find the babe Jesus that he might go and worship him; whereas all the facts and circumstances show that his real purpose was that he might find the babe in order io destroy him. And so the record in Matthew, chapter two (7-9), goes on to say: “Then Herod, when he liad privily called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the cast, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We cannot for a moment believe that the heavenly Father would use a wicked one like Herod and aid him in carrying out his wicked purpose by having a star to direct these three wise men to the place of Jesus’ birth, in view of the fact that the king had commanded that they should return and report to him, and when it was King Herod's purpose to destroy the babe. The fact is that the Devil and his instruments, Herod and others, would have succeeded in this nocked conspiracy and have caused the death of Hie babe Jesus had not God intervened to save the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On reaching Bethlehem the wise men found the babe and brought their presents and worshiped. Without a doubt it was their intention to return and report to lierod. And the result of such a return would have been the death of the child. But God here intervened and warned them in a dream. These wise magicians relied upon dreams. Matthew’s account says: “And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.” Satan again was thwarted in his wicked purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The real intent of Herod in sending these wise men is disclosed by what subsequently happened. It is written (Matt. 2:16): “Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men.” Determined not to be thwarted in his purpose, Satan and his instrument Herod were willing to destroy all the babes in and about Bethlehem, with the hope of destroying the one that was to be the King and Savior of the world. Jehovah saved the babe Jesus from this slaughter by directing his mother and Joseph to take the young child and flee into Egypt, which they did.—Matt. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We would not be justified, then, in presuming that God was using these devil worshipers, the “wise men” or magians, as the original language of the New Testament shows they were, magicians, tor the purpose of being his witnesses to the birth of his beloved Son. But on the contrary, the facts show that it pleased him to reveal this great truth to the shepherds and to use them as his witnesses. (Luke 2: 8-18) There is nothing whatsoever in the account of this experience of the wise men to indicate that their mission was in any wise beneficial to mankind; but the most charitab'o view we can take of it is that they were dupes of a deep-laid plot by Satan, the archconspirator, to destroy the seed of promise; and that Jehovah let the conspiracy proceed to the point where it would fully demonstrate the wickedness on the part of Satan and his instrument and then demonstrated his great protecting power. Without a doubt Satan has attempted to deceive and has deceived multitudes of honest people into believing that these “wise men” were the witnesses of the Lord, and has hid from their minds the fact that they in truth and in fact represented Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the wicked persecution that-eame upon the Lord Jesus afterward, and upon his followers to this day, has been because of the influence of Satan the Devil. And yet at all times the Lord has protected his own at the very critical moment, just as promised: “The angel of the Lord eneampeth round about them tl.at fear him, and delivereth them.”—Ps. 34:7</span></p>
