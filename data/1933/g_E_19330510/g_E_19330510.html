<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Broadcast by Judge Rutherford over chain Sunday, April 23, 1933)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE peoples of the nations of “Christendom” have been told that this is a “holy year” and that it is hoped that by the combined efforts of the ruling factors ‘a tide of religion will arise and sweep the nations into peace and prosperity’, relieving them of their present burdens. All reasonable persons have a desire for peace and prosperity. Without a knowledge of how these desirable things can be gained the people are ready to grab at anything that seems plausible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people could do no better than to observe a “holy year” within the true meaning of that term. A year is not made holy, however, by a proclamation of men, nor by an occasional offering of prayer. A truly holy year is a year entirely devoted to Jehovah God and His kingdom, teaching the people and leading them in the light of God's Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For centuries religionists have induced many to believe that a few men on earth rule by divine right and that whatsoever such men recommend the people should accept. That has resulted in keeping multitudes in ignorance. Millions believe that the year 1933 is a “holy year” because religious leaders have so decreed, and the principal of their flocks have joined in the proclamation of such decree. It is not my purpose to even attempt to convince the religionists and the principal of their flocks that they are wrong, because they have closed their ears to that which is spoken from the Word of God. Some will say that I am indulging in abuse and cruel criticism of religious leaders, but that is not true. I do not indulge in abuse of any man. I hold no personal animosity against anyone. My purpose and duty is to speak the truth for the aid and comfort of the people and to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is far better that the peoples of good will learn the truth now than to build a hope upon false testimony only to have that hope dashed to the earth at the end of the year. Is it not better that the truth be placed before the people and by them dispassionately considered, and each person given the privilege of deciding for himself what course he wants to take ? I am not concerned about the men who have presumed to proclaim this a “holy year”, but I am concerned as to whether the people shall be deceived by the declarations of men and whether they shall hear the truth and have an opportunity to take their stand on the side of God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Is Truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ Jesus, the greatest of all teachers ever among men, said concerning the Scriptures, which are the Word of God: “Thy word is truth.” Whatsoever is in opposition to the Scriptures is therefore false. The gentlemen who are responsible for this being designated as a “holy year” have invited all the people to pray to God “that we may be relieved of our burdens”; and by so doing they are estopped from denying that God’s Word is the truth. If you will act for your best interests you must return to the Bible and be guided by what Jehovah God has there expressed as His will. The Bible was written for this hour of distress, because therein it is stated that it was written for the admonition of the people upon whom the end of the world has come. (1 Corinthians 10:11) We have come to the end of the world and this scripture applies now. Those who disregard the Word of God and follow the advice and admonition of man, whether that be of pope, priest, clergymen, politicians or financiers, are certain to come to deep disappointment and sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his inaugural address the president of the United States quoted a part of the 29th chapter of Proverbs, to wit: “Where there is no vision,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the people perish”; and, according to the interpretation given by the public press, that means that unless the people have a vision of the political and commercial and religious affairs of this world they will perish. That Scriptural text has no such meaning, nor does it apply at all to this world. The entire text reads: ‘“Where there is no vision, the people perish; but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.” (Proverbs 29:18) The vision has reference to Jehovah God and His purposes, as expressed by and through His kingdom, and only those who now get an insight or vision of such truths and act in harmony therewith will escape at Armageddon. Truly, as the Scriptures say, those who have no vision perish; hence is magnified the importance of the people's now hearing the truth of and concerning God and His kingdom. Note that this Scripture text shows that the happy one is he who keeps God’s law; and to keep God's law means to do what He says, and not what imperfect men may say. In order for the people to keep God’s law they must have a knowledge of His law. Jehovah’s witnesses are now diligent in their efforts to inform the people, and it is those who name this a “holy year” that are trying to keep the people in ignorance of God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are two gods before the creation of earth: one the true and righteous God; and the other the mimic or fraudulent god. The name of the true and righteous God is Jehovah. The name of the mimic or wicked god given him by the Scriptures is Satan, Serpent, and Devil. His name means ‘deceiver’, and by appearing through his representatives, and claiming to be an angel of light, he deceives those who do not learn of and rely upon God’s Word of truth. When I say that men serve the Devil I am not abusing men, but, on the contrary, earnestly pointing out that they are deceived by Satan, who is the enemy of all men. Since the days of Nimrod and the building of the tower of Babel on the plains of Shinar the Devil has caused the names of men to be exalted and the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus to be pushed into the corner. That is the rule followed today in the world. With all kindness and sincerity I remind you who listened to the “Holy Hour Service” held in New York on the 2d of April that the name of man was there exalted by frequently using and applying to men such terms as “Holy Father”, “Your Eminence,” and “Your Excellency”; whereas the name of Jehovah God, His King and His kingdom were not mentioned at all. No reference was made to God’s expressed purpose of dealing with the human race by and through His kingdom. Let all who desire to follow such course by bestowing high esteem and exaltation on men do so, but I am reminding you common people who are of good will that such a course is displeasing to Jehovah God, and this 1 do in order that you may give honor to God and His kingdom, and not to man. Jesus said to those who exalt men: “That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” (Luke 16:15) Satan has led men into his trap by exalting men and disregarding God. And why has he thus done? Because the policy of Satan is to turn men away from the true God and he resorts to subtle means of flattery to accomplish this unrighteous purpose. Keep in mind always that Satan long ago defied Jehovah God to put men on earth who would honor Jehovah and who would maintain their integrity toward Him. If all men understood that the Devil is the enemy of man there would be very few if any that would fall into Satan’s trap. Because they have no vision or knowledge of God and His kingdom the multitudes fall into Satan’s subtle trap and will perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The act of declaring this a “holy year” for the bringing in of peace and prosperity is a presumptuous sin before Almighty God. No man or company of men are running Jehovah’s business so as to enable them to “change times and laws”, and it is so stated in Daniel 7:25. No man has the power and authority to use a golden hammer or any other instrument to break open a door and say to the people: “This symbolizes the entrance into the blessings of the Lord.” For the people to believe and follow such a leader means to walk on in darkness. No man or combination of men can make the year holy by merely declaring it so to be. The declaring of this to be a “holy year” is contrary to God’s Word and His will, and it would therefore follow that peace and prosperity would not come in answer to the prayers of those who inaugurated this year to accomplish their purpose. To those who commit such presumptuous acts Jehovah, at Isaiah 55: 8, says: “My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways [of decreeing this a ‘holy year’] my ways.” God does not follow the lead of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year cannot be made holy, nor holiness gained, by visiting famous buildings called “churches” or “temples”, nor by making pilgrimages to shrines, nor by worshiping before men or going through outward forms of penance, nor by exalting men to high positions in a church organization. Exactly contrary thereto God’s Word says (Psalm 99: 5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font6">: “Exalt ye Jehovah our God, and worship at his footstool : holy is he.” Furthermore, Jesus said concerning the exaltation of men (Matthew 23:9): “And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” The question for the people to determine is whether they wish to follow what man says or obey Jehovah God's Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are now in the last days because the time has come when Satan’s organization must shortly go down before the onward march of the great Conqueror, the Christ of God. The conditions which you observe today exactly fulfil the prophecies long ago written in the Bible concerning the end of the world or last days. I am calling attention thereto, and to the presumptuous acts of the mighty men of this world, not to ridicule them, but for the benefit of the people of good will who want to know the right way to go. The meeting together of men and declaring this to be a “holy year”, and the going through certain forms of worship, is contrary to the will of God. The Lord foretold such in these words (2 Timothy 3:1, 2, 5): “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away.” The people are now being divided between God’s organization and Satan’s organization. Let everyone be free to take his own course; but bear in mind that only those who turn away from Satan’s organization, and take their stand firmly and honestly on the side of Jehovah God, and who are then guided by His Word, will be spared at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may be said that the Catholic organization, headed by its mighty pontiff, the multitudinous divisions of the Protestant organizations headed by their wise and eloquent clergy, and the Jews led by their philosophical rabbis, this united religious multitude, supported by the professional politicians and financial giants, will present such an inspiring spectacle before the throne of God that even He will hear and grant their petitions that they may be relieved of their burdens and given more ease and comfort. The question is, Will Jehovah God hear and grant the prayers of such an unholy alliance ? According to the words of the Scriptures, God answers, No!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures declare that all men are by nature unrighteous and that righteousness can be obtained only by faith in and obedience to Jehovah and faith in Christ Jesus and His shed blood as the redemptive price of man. Prayer to Jehovah must be asked in the name of Christ Jesus, because God has thus commanded it. All Jewish rabbis entirely reject Jesus Christ as the Redeemer of man. All modernist clergymen do likewise reject Him and His precious blood, and the entire combination heretofore mentioned rejects Jehovah God’s provision through Christ and His kingdom to bless all the families of the earth with peace and prosperity, and, on the contrary, have given their allegiance to the League of Nations, which is a product of the Devil. The entire combination forms the visible ruling powers of this world, and concerning such it is written that the whole world lies in the wicked one, Satan. (1 John 5:19) Now what does God’s Word say about hearing and answering the prayers of such as give their allegiance to the w’icked one and his organization and who therefore form a part of the world and hence are God’s enemies? Will the prayers of such bring prosperity and peace during this so-called “holy year” ? The following scriptures bear upon the point and are conclusive. Proverbs 15: 29: “The Lord is far from the wicked; but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.” Proverbs 28: 9: “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.” 1 Peter 3:12: “For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” All prayers made during this so-called “holy year” for peace and prosperity will go unanswered, because God’s Word declares that there shall be no lasting peace and prosperity until the earth is rid of its oppressor Satan and of his wicked organization. It is vital that the people know this fact, in order that they may choose what course they will take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long ago Jehovah chose the Jews as a people for himself, established them at Jerusalem, and put His own righteous name there. Satan by means of fraud and deceit caused the Jews to fall away from their covenant and to indulge in idol worship. Time and again God warned them that He would punish them, and did punish them. The Jewish nation was a type of ‘‘Christendom’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By and through Christ Jesus and His apostles there was established on earth the true worship of Jehovah God and which is properly called true Christianity. Within a short time an organization labeled ‘‘Christianity''' grew to be a great organization and then fell an easy victim to Satan, and many of the nations now call themselves “Christian nations&quot; but at the same time follow Satan's lead. It is written, at 1 Corinthians 10:11: “Now all these things happened unto [the Jews] for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.” Concerning what came upon the Jews that which is recorded in the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel applies specifically to “Christendom”, particularly at this very day. To some of these things I now refer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zedekiah, the last king of the Jews, and his official associates proclaimed a “holy year” at Jerusalem and led the people to believe that they should have peace and prosperity and freedom, and then they used that occasion as a scheme to bring the people into further subjection and serfdom. Then Jehovah God declared to the rulers that because of their hypocrisy and duplicity He would send His executioner and destroy Jerusalem, and within a short time Jerusalem was razed to the ground. (Jeremiah 34:8-22) The nations of “Christendom” are the counterpart or antitype of Jerusalem, because the Scriptures so declare. Now the Catholics, Protestants and Jews and the principal ones of their flocks form a confederacy with the ostensible and announced purpose, by their own efforts, to bring to the people peace, prosperity, liberty and relief from human suffering. The time to accomplish this they call a “holy year”. The real purpose is an effort to keep the people quiet for a while by causing them to hope for better times to come. The scheme is hypocritical on the face of it. Of the leaders, the Catholics have no confidence in the Protestants, the Protestants have no confidence in the Catholics, and the Jews have no confidence in either Catholics or Protestants, and the politicians and Big Business men know that the whole crowd is insincere. The so-called “holy year” will not bring the suffering peoples relief, nor peace, nor prosperity. On the contrary, the end of the year will find the people in greater distress than they are now in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another striking illustration as to what shall come upon the nations of “Christendom” shortly is set forth in the 37th chapter of Jeremiah’s prophecy. Jerusalem, having become unfaithful to God, there pictures the present-day hypocritical “Christendom”. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his army pictured Satan and his militant forces which now pretend to give aid to “Christendom”. The Chaldeans there mentioned picture Jehovah’s Executioner sent against “Christendom” to destroy it. Jehovah God sent Jeremiah His prophet to give warning to the rulers and to the people of Jerusalem that the Chaldeans would come again and destroy the city as His executioner. The Jewish clergy, the rabbis, who then claimed to be holy and acting as the spokesmen to the people, declared that there was no cause for fear and tried to prevent the people from hearing God’s prophet. The people were in doubt as to what they should do. Then God caused Jeremiah to prophesy these words to the Jews (Jeremiah 37:9): “Thus saith the Lord, Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.” God’s executioner did return, and destroyed the city of Jerusalem. God caused Jeremiah to utter the following words to the people of Jerusalem concerning those who were falsely prophesying peace and misleading the people (Jeremiah 6:13,14): “For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. They . . . [are] saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.” Exactly that same thing is now taking place in “Christendom”, whose leaders have proclaimed this a “holy year”, and who try to prevent the people from hearing God’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There can not and will not be peace and prosperity sent to “Christendom” from Jehovah God as long as the unholy alliance of commercial and political oppressive power, with hypocritical religion, continues to exist. The prayers of such for peace and prosperity are a mockery; and “God is not mocked”. The petitioners and many people will be deceived, but God knows the secret intents of all. The mouthpieces of this hypocritical alliance continue to cry out, “Peace, peace,” while at the same time every one of these nations continues to heap burdens upon the people in order to prepare for war. Satan and his organization, pictured by the three frogs of Revelation, continue to croak and boast and bluster and to gather the nations together for the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and there “Christendom” shall fall.—Revelation 16:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Peace and prosperity are not possible under the present unrighteous world, because Jehovah has decreed that it shall be destroyed. The proof He has abundantly set forth in the prophecies of Ezekiel and Jeremiah. Another example in proof of this I now cite. God’s covenant people under the rule of Israel’s unfaithful king mixed politics and false religion with their outward claims of serving Jehovah. The exact counterpart of this is today found in “Christendom”. The leaders claim that these nations are Christian nations, and yet all of them mix politics with their outward claims of worshiping God. They attempt to unite all kinds of religion under one arrangement, even those who deny Christ and His precious blood, and expect God to hear their prayers. Jehovah sent His prophets to give warning to the Israelites, but that warning was ignored. Then Jehovah sent Jehu as executioner to execute His judgment against that unfaithful people. In that Jehu was a type of Christ Jesus, whom God will now use as His executioner of “Christendom”. Jehu proceeded quickly to his task; and the messengers of the rulers hurried out to inquire of Jehu and said, “Is it peace, Jehu ?” and he said, “What peace is there as long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?’ (2 Kings 9:17-22) Now the Lord sends warning to the rulers of “Christendom” and they ignore His warning and reject His King. The Greater Jehu, Christ Jesus, is proceeding with His army to the war of Armageddon to execute Jehovah’s vengeance against all of His foes. The unholy alliance of “Christendom” cries out, “Give us peace and prosperity,” and the great Executioner Christ replies: ‘What! Peace, when there is so much hypocrisy, political religion and Devil worship among you?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehu then caused the people who supported the Devil worship to identify themselves, and then in the presence of Jehonadab, who pictured the order-loving people of the present day, Jehu slew every one of the false religionists and de-famers of God’s holy name.—2 Kings 10:15-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures show that those who now form the unholy alliance and proclaim this a “holy year” will camouflage their real purpose, put on a bold front, and declare to the people that they have actually brought about peace and safety; and then mark what the Lord says shall come to pass (1 Thessalonians 5:3): “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The combined efforts of the big men of religion, Big Business, and politics cannot possibly now bring peace and prosperity to “Christendom”, because it is not God’s time and their prayers God will not hear. It is written in God's Word (Ecclesiastes 3:1,8): “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. ... A time of war, and a time of peace.” The time for Jehovah God to force the war is nigh. It may not come this year, but it will not be much longer delayed; and no efforts of any creatures can stop it, because God does not change His purpose. Up to this time God has not taken a hand in the troubles that afflict the peoples of earth, but He declares that He will rise up at Armageddon and come forth and smite the nations of “Christendom” to the dust and that these shall fall and not rise again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public press quotes the pontiff of Rome as saying that the present suffering and distress of the peoples of the world are a punishment from God upon them because of their unfaithfulness to the church, and now he and his associates pray for peace and prosperity for the world. God is not at all responsible for the suffering of the people. In Revelation 12:12 the statement is plainly made that Satan the Devil has brought this woe and suffering upon the peoples of the world. God has taken no hand in the trouble thus far, but He declares that soon at Armageddon He will smite Satan and all of his organization both visible and invisible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Big Business, political rulers and big church men have joined hands together. It is that combine that has gained the control of the gold and other property of the world and as instruments of Satan have brought about oppression of the people, and it is because of such oppression that the people now cry out. This hypocritical combine prays for peace and prosperity, and to them Jehovah says (James 5: 3-5): “Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept hack by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.” Instead of the common people’s joining this alliance and being guided by them, Jehovah says to the people of good will (Zephaniah 3: 8, 9): “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God gave His Word that Christ Jesus as King and Conqueror should redeem man with His own blood and then vindicate the name of the Most High. Jesus performed some of these prophecies in miniature when He was on earth 1900 years ago, and now He comes and performs them in completeness. When the time came for the man Jesus to offer himself as King and Blesser of the Jews He did not come carrying a golden hammer in His hand, with silver trumpets announcing His arrival, but He came meek and lowly, riding upon a jackass, magnifying the name of Jehovah God. He was then rejected by the clergy of that day and He pronounced desolation upon their house. (Matthew 21:1-43) In 1918 Jehovah, having installed Christ Jesus as the King of the world, presented Him to “Christendom” and furnished an abundance of evidence from the prophecies, and from the physical facts, that God’s time was here for His King to judge and to rule and it was the clergy of “Christendom” that took the lead in rejecting Christ and His kingdom and accepted in its stead the League of Nations; and now at the temple of Jehovah Christ pronounces the judgment of desolation upon “Christendom”. Thus we see that Jerusalem and “Christendom” have parallel experiences. Concerning this very time Jehovah says (Psalm 11: 4-G): “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The temple of Jehovah is His righteous organization of which Christ Jesus is the Head. Jehovah has made Christ the judge of all things and has committed to Him the power to execute judgment. (Malachi 3:1-4; John 5: 22-27) Now Jehovah speaks to the people of the nations that have taken His name and says (Habakkuk 2: 20): “The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Instead of the leaders of the nations giving heed to God’s Word and advising the people to follow His instruction, a company of selfish men, bent on ruling the world in their own way, presumptuously declare this a “holy year” and call upon the people to follow them in their efforts to establish peace and prosperity in the world exactly contrary to the Word of God. They do not give honor to Jehovah God and to His kingdom, but bow before men and before images. Let the people who desire life and happiness no longer give ear to the false claims of selfish men. To you, through the prophet, Jehovah God says (Isaiah 45:22-24): ‘Look unto me [Jehovah], and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is none else. I have sworn by rayself, the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me [and not alone to Jesus] every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear . . . and all that are against him shall be put to shame.’ You, the people, must take your choice to follow the advice of men or to follow the words of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the past ten years Jehovah’s witnesses, by His grace, have declared the truth to the rulers of “Christendom”, and which truth the rulers have not only rejected, but they have connived at the persecution and hurt of those who brought to them the message of truth. Jehovah’s witnesses in themselves are not important, but as Jehovah’s anointed they are the apple of His eye on earth. Now His witnesses turn to you, the common people, and call your attention to God’s message written in Micah 1:2-4: “Hear, all ye people; hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple. And the mountains [governments] shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.” The unholy alliance that has presumptuously declared this to be a “holy year” are not proper guides for you, regardless of whether you have been a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Catholic, Protestant or Jew. The year will not bring peace and prosperity, but the end thereof will find you nearer to the end of Satan’s oppressive rule, and thereafter shall come real peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who are against God’s kingdom under Christ are wicked, and concerning them it is written (Isaiah 57: 21): “There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” Those who have proclaimed this a “holy year” are against God and His kingdom; and this is proved by their actions. When Jehovah’s witnesses carried the Kingdom message in printed form into Italy recently the pontiff and his political allies stopped the distribution of that message and confiscated and destroyed the books containing it. England and Canada have prevented the message of God’s kingdom from being broadcast by radio. In the United States the clergy and their allies who are called “the higher ups” have given orders that the Kingdom message shall not be broadcast here over certain radio stations and have thus prevented the broadcasting of this message today. These opposers rejoice when Jehovah’s witnesses are arrested and imprisoned for speaking the truth. It is to be expected that it would be so, because the prophecy of Jehovah foretells the same. I call attention to these things that the people may see that God will not answer the prayers of this unholy alliance for peace and prosperity. Concerning them Jehovah says (Psalm 35:26,27): ‘Let them be brought to shame and confusion [even during this so-called “holy year”] who rejoice at the hurt of my witnesses.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By His prophet Daniel Jehovah gives a brief history of the chief nations that have ruled from ancient Egypt to the present time, including the alliance that has declared this a “holy year”, and then says (Daniel 2:44): “And in the days of these [rulers] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” In the face of this plain statement of Jehovah God the people will be foolish to expect a confederacy of men to bring in peace and prosperity. For your own protection I am pointing you to the Word of God that you may have an opportunity to take the only safe course. You may receive this message or reject it, as you see fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rulers have been told the truth and they have rejected it, and thus they identify themselves with the enemy of God. Those who are proclaiming this a “holy year” are conniving at the downfall of Jehovah’s witnesses and are fighting against God. Jesus foretold that when He said to His faithful followers (Mark 13:9): “But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to [courts]; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.” Jehovah permits His witnesses now to be persecuted by the powers of “Christendom” that His witnesses may have opportunity to prove their integrity toward Him, and that the leaders of “Christendom” may convict themselves before Jehovah and meet their just fate at Armageddon. In Psalm 83 Jehovah foretold that those who proclaim this a “holy year” would form a conspiracy against His witnesses and that then He would tear off their mask and bring them to shame, and this He says He will do in order that all ‘men may know that God, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, is the Most High over all the earth’.— Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hole or door opened in a wall at the Vatican is not ‘a symbol of the way into the blessings of God’; and therefore the prophecy at the 118th Psalm has been misapplied. The ones who have opened the door at Rome and referred to it as ‘a symbol of blessings’ have rejected Christ as King, and Jehovah has rejected them. The words of the psalmist following apply to Jehovah’s devoted people, and God causes these faithful witnesses now to say (Psalm 118:19): “Open to me the gates of righteousness” ; not the doorway into some building erected by men, but the way into God’s kingdom. The psalmist then shows that the religionists of “Christendom” have rejected Christ, the Head Stone of God’s kingdom, and continuing says (Psalm 118: 20-22): “This [is the] gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter. I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. The stone [Christ the Redeemer and King] which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.” If the alliance that has proclaimed this a “holy year” had faith in God and in His kingdom under Christ they would tell the people what the Scriptures teach, to wit, That Jehovah is God, and that there is no means of salvation and blessing except through the blood of Christ Jesus, and His kingdom (Acts 4:12), and they would then assemble the people and use every means possible, including the radio, to teach them the truth of God’s Word. Instead of so doing they fight against God’s message of truth and connive to keep the people in ignorance and then have the temerity to say, “We will pray God to send us peace and prosperity.” They not only will be disappointed, but will be brought to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan’s is the master mind that has organized a conspiracy against Jehovah and His faithful witnesses, and he then forms an unholy alliance to proclaim this a “holy year” in order to divert the minds of the people away from God’s kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses do not expect to convert the rulers. Their divine commission is to speak the truth only as witnesses of the Most High. To you who have devoted yourselves to Jehovah God and His kingdom He now says: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> am the Lord thy God, . . . and I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. ... Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am [Jehovah].”—Isaiah 51:15,16; 43:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Today there are many in the church organizations who have had a great desire to see their church take a bold stand for God and His kingdom, but they have been greatly disappointed. These the Lord calls “prisoners” because they are held by the powerful influence of the political clergymen. You prisoners must now make your choice between Satan’s organization and God’s kingdom. To you Jehovah now says (Revelation 18:4): ‘Come out from the unholy alliance, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her punishments.’ Without a vision of the truth and affirmative action you will perish. To the people of good will Jehovah now says: ‘Know that I am God, and choose you this day whom ye will serve.’ Peace and prosperity cannot be brought to the earth by men, but will come by God’s kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah now bestows the high and great honor of His name upon His faithful anointed and sends them forth as His witnesses to declare to the people that He is God and that His kingdom is at hand. To you, therefore, as His faithful witnesses, He now says (Isaiah 62:10): “Go through, go through the gates [into the kingdom of God]; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” This command Jehovah’s witnesses will now obey regardless of all opposition and persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lest the people perish they must now have a vision of Jehovah and His kingdom. No lasting peace and prosperity can come to the peoples of earth until Satan’s organization is completely destroyed. Following the battle of Armageddon Jehovah by and through Christ will bring to the peoples of earth a real holy period of a thousand years of everlasting peace and prosperity that shall surpass the fondest dreams of man. What boundless blessings the Kingdom will bring to the people it shall be my privilege, by His grace, to tell you at my next speech from this station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hear the truth and then choose whether you prefer to follow the leadings of imperfect men or whether you desire to know and to serve the great Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ. Faithful men and women who are God’s witnesses are now coming to you with the printed information to aid you to gain the knowledge and the much needed vision of God and His purposes, and the blessings that He will bring to you by and through His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Effect of Holy Year” and Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N THE inscrutable wisdom of God it is hidden from His children what effects are accomplished by the proclamations of the truth which He puts forth, and of which He permits them to be, to some extent, the mouthpieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judge Rutherford, lecturing over a chain of 55 radio stations, talked to millions, probably, and certainly to hundreds of thousands of people on Sunday morning, April 23, in his lecture on “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity”, and he can hardly expect to know, in this life, much about how many listened, or how they were impressed. The lecture was not given to try to impress his fellow men: it was given to bear witness to the truth; to do God’s will, and to let the results be what they may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But we may with confidence speak for some thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses that were out on the firing line and stopped their witness work for an hour so that they might listen to this most inspiring and most convincing address. If you missed hearing the address under just those conditions you missed one of the blessings you might have had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Conditions for radio reception were excellent at the time the lecture was given; it was a popular hour; it was on a subject the people want to know something about; the lecture gave every listener abundant food for reflection. It gave a thrill of happiness to every worker out in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anybody ought to be able to see, when his attention is drawn to it, that, as the judge said, no year can be made holy by a proclamation, and the mere fact that the Scriptures are cited as authority binds those who cite them to give heed to what they say, and shape their courses to suit. It is obvious that Judge Rutherford had it right when he said, in effect, that it is those that have named this a “holy year” that are trying to keep the people in ignorance and therefore actually working against the very thing proclaimed. How can such persons in truth and in honesty expect Jehovah God to bless anything with which they have to do, when they accept or appropriate to themselves titles and honors in abundance, and push the names of both Jehovah God and Christ Jesus into a corner?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not visiting shrines and churches that will make the year holy; not a bit of it. It is only the doing of God’s will that will make it so, and on the very day in question His own witnesses, bearing in their hands and on their lips His message of truth, were going about among the people and telling them that their deliverance is coming about, not through a clergy-proclaimed “holy year”, but by Jehovah God's act of vengeance, putting an end to the hypocrisy that has overburdened the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In one circle of witness workers who took a breathing spell to listen to Judge Rutherford’s powerful presentation on the “Holy Year” many a hearty laugh went around when some particularly telling point was made, as the one which he made that it is not the clergymen that God will listen to, and that, anyway, ‘the Catholics have no confidence in the Protestants, and Protestants have no confidence in Catholics, and Jews have no confidence in either Catholics or Protestants.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On his first call after listening to the foregoing lecture one of Jehovah’s witnesses placed in the first home at which he called a complete set of 13 of Judge Rutherford’s books and 14 booklets. Would he have done it if he had not been inspired by the proclamation of the great truths he had just heard? We may well question it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Peterboro, Ont., Canada. “Please accept an appreciation of your continued work of spreading the truth. We were pleased to hear again Judge Rutherford for one-hour program Sunday morning over radio WGR Buffalo. The lecture came to us very clear and distinct. Our canary bird Tom, who is now in his old age, seldom sings, but sang during the overture and almost continuously during the lecture. When the judge ceased speaking, the bird ceased to sing. The flowers in the window smiled, but my hearing was not keen enough to hear their notes of approval. Wife and I were both pleased to note the bird’s appreciation of something real and good. Would that many of our citizens who are now in the dark could realize the truth of the words given out by Judge Rutherford from time to time.” M.T.B.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N POLAND 3,500,000 Jews are being done to death, every door of employment being closed to them, even by their own kindred. In a cellar room an investigator found nine persons living like swine. There were two inches of water on the floor, with no drain, chimney or water closet. In a garret next door three families lived in one room. It is estimated that 90 percent of the inhabitants of the Polish ghettos are tubercular.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">R</span><span class="font6">UMANIANS resent Standard Oil control of the oil industry of Rumania, or at least the program of wage cuts and lay-offs. Four thousand workmen went on the warpath, attacked the office building of the company and destroyed furniture and papers. Two hundred and fifty were arrested and then the mob tried to charge the police station and rescue them, but were repulsed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE world’s largest clock is on the new building of the Shell Anglo-Persian Oil Company, in London. The building, costing £1,000,000, occupies the former site of the Hotel Cecil. Dimensions of the clock are not stated. If larger than the clock on the Colgate building, Jersey City, it must be a whopper; the dial on the latter one is 38 feet across. There is one in Boston with a dial 34 feet across.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pennington in the Cleveland Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ames Pennington, South Euclid, Ohio, (not one of our subscribers) writes with courage in the Cleveland </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font6"> when he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is shameful for a man to die as part of an organization designed to slaughter men, women and children, to devastate and to inflict upon humanity untold agony, privation and shame. Nor is a man a hero for being part of such an organization. Instead, he is a coward for lacking the courage to withstand joining it. By all desirable citizens the gangster is loathed, yet infinitely more courage is needed to go out and kill as he does, alone, than to be one of a herd of charging maniacs shooting and hacking without power of thought. For war there is not even the justification of self-defense. Every nation, according to its leaders, fights in self-defense. Instead of cheering our statesmen, it would be better if we cursed them as traitors to humanity. No man can fight in battle and be a Christian too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Might Get Caught Next Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HIEVES who thought they were using the most approved methods took over the management of a shoe manufacturing company, at Broadway and Fourth street, New York city, for forty-five minutes the other day. When they came in they cut the telephone wires, bound the hands and feet of all employees with adhesive tape, and put tape over their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although, as they claimed, their motto is, “Success is not an accident. It comes to the man that does his work better than the other fellow,” yet they were not quite perfect. As fast as people came into the office they were bound and taped and relieved of their valuables, but one man was not properly tied, and as soon as they left he shouted for help. They got away all right, but might get caught the next time. The heart of New York seems to present a great field for this thriving industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Big Banks Trying to Ruin Themselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font6">ECAUSE the big banks of New York city are large holders of traction securities, they are pressing New York city to abandon the 5c fare, which, if done, will make their traction stocks and bonds very much more valuable. The pressure is brought to bear by reluctance to loan the city the money needed to pay current bills, in between tax collections. This scheme of the bankers is really a scheme to ruin themselves; for while it would add much to the wealth of men whose income is now more than $10,000 a year, it would greatly reduce the incomes of those who have the least, but who nevertheless, because they are so much greater in number, purchase 75 percent of the goods and services marketed in the United States. When you ruin your customers you ruin yourself. The big banks have not yet learned that, but are in a fair way to do so soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report of Committee on Social Trends</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is plenty of food for thought in the report of former President Hoover’s Research Committee on Social Trends. Five hundred investigators, working for three years, ended their labors with the close of the year 1932. Frankly they expect a dictatorship, accompanied by “violent revolution, dark periods of serious repression of libertarian and democratic forms”, and an emergence of “the quasi-govern-mental corporation, the Government-owned corporation, the mixed corporation” and other evidences of “business men become actual rulers”. They say that “the best which any group of economic planners can do with the data now in hand, bulky but inadequate, is to lay plans for making plans”. The report covers a vast range. It notes the probability that one out of every five or six marriages contracted is broken by divorce. It mentions that the farmer raises food for himself, three members of his family, 12 Americans not living on farms, and for two foreigners, a total of 18 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Best-posted Man on Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE best-posted man on Russia is probably Walter Duranty, fifteen years correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> at Moscow. His opinion of what is being accomplished there is probably based on more information than that of any other writer. In a review in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> recently he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In most respects the Socialist framework is solid and sure; there is no loss of determination among the leaders, no sign that the nation, though it sweats and grumbles under its burden, has any thought of revolt or unwillingness to continue the work. The weakest link of the socialist chain is merchandising and distribution; if this can be strengthened, present difficulties will be overcome. Meanwhile, the whole nation is acquiring knowledge and learning its new tasks with frantic eagerness. Times are hard and will not be easy in the near future; progress may be slower than anticipated, the goal more remote. But unless untoward and unforeseen circumstances intervene, I, for one, cannot doubt the issue or question the ultimate success of Socialist building in the U. S. S. R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Raising Money 3,000 Years Ago, and Now </span><span class="font3">(From a church notice)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">N THE year “1000 B.C. For the building of Solomon's Temple, ‘Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly, and gave for the service of the house, &amp;c.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“‘Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly to the Lord: and David the King also rejoiced with great joy.’-1 Chron. 29: 6, 9.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the year 1933 (A.D.). “Then the parishioners came together to consult how they were to get money to build the church. The people would not offer willingly, so they consulted together and determined to have all kinds of amusements, such as wax-works, Punch and Judy, tableaux vivants, raffles (which are illegal), fortune telling, lucky tubs, shooting galleries, and other such-like things; also whist drives and dancing, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Then the people rejoiced that they had made some money by these means and offered it to the Lord for building His Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Worse Things than the Dole</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE workers of Britain and America bared their breasts to make the world safe for democracy, and to secure the payment of the interest on Mr. Morgan’s French bonds. Then the British, knowing that the heroes would have to live, made some provision for the unemployed. This unemployment insurance has come to be called “the dole”; not a good word, but used in the press to give an evil taint to a good system. In the United States we have another system. Helen Hull, Philadelphia settlement worker, at a Senate hearing tells about it. In Philadelphia the unemployed heroes do not starve to death, because they steal, beg, borrow and concentrate on obtaining food like prowling cats. The heroes send their children out to snatch food from wholesale markets, steal milk from babies, steal from pushcarts, or steal anything else that can be exchanged for food. This is what they went to France for, and the Morgan crowd do certainly appreciate what the heroes did for them while they were using them; but, now that the bonds are O.K., it does not much matter •what happens to the heroes. Looking after the petty needs of heroes is not a business for Big Business to adopt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Barnesville, Ohio, has a police chief that is a wonder, of his kind. One Sunday early this year three hundred of Jehovah’s witnesses visited his little town, with love in their hearts, and wisdom on their tongues, telling the people the good news that Jehovah’s kingdom is at hand and that it is the hope of the world. The chief became so excited that he set off the town’s fire siren and then sent out the whole fire department to arrest every intelligent-looking person in town. Many were hauled in, accused of being at large in the streets. At length charges were trumped up against just one person, and those charges were false. If the chief had had his way he would have called out the Ohio National Guard, the American Legion, the United States Army, the “pope’s” body guard, and Will Rogers, to make his town safe for hypocrisy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Something About Blood Purifiers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">LTERATIVES, or blood purifiers, as they are commonly called, change the process of nutrition and excretion, restoring the morbid organs of the system to healthy action. They promote absorption of inflammatory deposits, chiefly by stimulating the lymphatic glands. As impure accumulations in the blood arise mainly from defective action of one or more of the secretory organs, which fail to carry out of the system their portion of waste material, so purification of the blood can be accomplished by reestablishing the functions of these glands. Among the most popular roots and herbs used as blood purifiers are sarsaparilla, yellow dock root, burdock root, Kansas sunflower, and hundreds or more of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any one of these roots and herbs can be used at home as a tea. You simply take a heaping teaspoonful of the dried root or herb and place it in a cup and pour on boiling water; let it stand until cool, and drink one or two cupfuls a day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is so simple one wonders why people spend dollars for so-called “blood purifiers”, when they can make their own for 25c a quart, which would cost several dollars at a drug store. Making medicine this way you do not pay for the water and you are absolutely sure that the medicine is made from pure natural roots and herbs and that it contains no harmful chemical or mineral drugs. Most medicines and extracts of medicinal plants are almost worthless after they are six months to a year old. Anyone can see the folly of purchasing medicines that have been on the shelves for months and perhaps years, when you could make a far better article by gathering the roots and herbs yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For Loss of Appetite</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do you ever feel tired and worn out, suffer loss of appetite, and have just a general worn out feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If so, it is merely Nature’s way of telling you that she needs a little help, something to tone up the system. And where could you find a better tonic or one less expensive than the root of gentian?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentian is a powerful tonic. It improves the appetite, strengthens digestion, gives force to the circulation, and, in general, tones up the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are many varieties of gentian, although not all are used medicinally. The blue or the American gentian has a perennial branching, somewhat fleshy root, with a simple erect rough stem, eight to ten inches in height, and bears large blue flowers, blossoming from September to December. Another species widely used medicinally is the kind common in central and southern Europe, especially on the Pyrenees and the Alps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentian has long been used medicinally as a tonic. The name of gentian, in fact, is said to be derived from Gentianus, king of Illyria, who ■was the first to discover the medical qualities of this wonderful root.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentian root is the main ingredient of many of the old-time stomach bitters. It makes an excellent bitter tonic when placed in any kind of wine. Its bitter taste can be overcome to a great extent by using the same amount of licorice root with the gentian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gentian wine is an old-time favorite tonic. It improves the appetite in a most remarkable degree. It is made by simply placing one or two ounces of gentian root in a gallon of any sweet wine. Gentian bitters is made in the same way, except that two to four ounces of the root is needed to a gallon of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Camomile Tea Beautifier</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">German camomile is a tonic, excellent for the stomach and kidneys, and useful in expelling worms. The tea is made like ordinary household tea, and you simply steep a heaping teaspoonful of the flowers in a cup of boiling water for half an hour, strain, and drink half cupful, hot or cold, upon retiring. It is entirely harmless and may be given to children. Externally, it is used in a strong decoction as a wash for weak and sore eyes, and it is harmless for this, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to its medicinal virtues, German camomile is known as a beautifier. An old herbalist writes that camomile tea has been used in her family for years, and that it will give one a complexion to be proud of, if taken internally as a tea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Camomile is also very beneficial to the hair, to give it luster and bring out the high-lights. For blonde hair, which is so apt to become drab and darkened without continual attention, camomile is extremely good. If it lacks the sheen and luster, camomile tea is excellent. The hair</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is shampooed thoroughly. Then the final rinsing is with camomile tea, which is made by boiling a small handful of the camomile flowers in a quart of water for three or four minutes, and straining through muslin or cheesecloth. Do not rinse out with cold water; let it remain on the hair, as the herb is harmless and will not affect the hair structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Camomile, and, in fact, every medicinal herb, loses its medicinal value with age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Butternut Bark Laxative</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Butternut bark has been proved a very fine laxative for the aged and middle-aged where no drastic action is tolerated. Only the inner bark of the root of butternut is used. When this first is uncovered it is a pure white, but upon exposure to the air and light it becomes yellow and finally a deep brown. This change of color is due to the organic elements it contains. Butternut bark is a wonderful laxative and does not gripe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is especially valuable to the aged and middle-aged when mixed with equal parts of Rocky Mountain grape root, senna and licorice root. It is just about as fine a laxative tonic as can be made. Try this formula if you are troubled with congestion of the bowels. It is as harmless as any laxative can be. It may be given to children. Butternut bark and Rocky Mountain grape root may be used in many combinations of roots and herbs. They are absolutely harmless. I will repeat the ingredients once more: Equal parts of butternut bark, Rocky Mountain grape root, senna leaves and licorice root. The directions for making this or any other tea are always the same: one or two heaping teaspoonfuls of the mixture to a cup of boiling water. The whole cupful may be taken at bedtime, or as you desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tonic and Demulcent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To appreciate this valuable remedy we must consider the well-known fact that as we grow older the process of katabolism, that is, the breaking down of waste materials of the tissues, becomes slower and is much retarded; and anything that will promote oxidation and the quickening of this process purifies the blood and keeps our tissues younger and healthier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While there are a number of botanies I could mention, there is one that stands out more prominent than others and has been used for this purpose by our Indians. This wonderful botanic is known as Rocky Mountain grape root. This root is valued to this day by physicians, and the tincture, while quite inferior, may be found in every drug store. Rocky Mountain grape root, to be of any value, must be fresh, last season’s crop, and the infusion or tea must be made fresh daily. A tincture six months old or more has deteriorated. The same is true of almost every tincture made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here is an ideal formula: Take equal parts of Rocky Mountain grape root, butternut bark and marshmallow root; mix them together. Now place a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of boiling water, let it cool, strain, and drink the cupful during the day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This formula is tonic, demulcent and slightly laxative. It is so harmless it may be given to children, but it is of especial value to the aged and middle-aged men or women who have poor circulation of the blood, catch cold easily, and require a general blood tonic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Anemia and Poor Circulation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those of you who have had occasion to use an iron tonic, iron pills or tincture of iron at some time or other, will admit that this inorganic iron compound, in whichever form you used it, did not quite agree with you: it upset your digestion, caused constipation, and if the inorganic iron came in contact with your teeth it discolored them. Your system undoubtedly needed the iron; but why take inorganic iron, when nature offers you organic iron in a large number of plants and vegetables?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The root of yellow dock has plenty of organic iron for all your needs, and this organic iron will not upset your system. It will not interfere with your digestion; it will not discolor your teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you are anemic, catch cold easily, have poor circulation, add a little organic iron to your blood by drinking a tea of the root of yellow dock. This root grows everywhere, probably in your back yard or along the roadsides and in the fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Asthma</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who of you readers would look for any medicinal value in wild plum bark ? Yet, I am sure there are several hundred of you afflicted with the very ailment for which wild plum bark has been so successfully used. This ailment is asthma. I have hundreds of letters of testimony of the great value of wild plum bark in this ailment. The inner bark of wild plum is gathered just before the flowers open, and it is dried, and cut into small pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make a tea of it, you simply take a heaping teaspoonful of the dried bark and place it in a cup of boiling water, let it remain until it cools, then drink two or three cupfuls a day. It is so harmless it can be given to children. If you are suffering with asthma, try it, and you will be surprised at the wonderful results. One man whom I know slept sitting in a chair for years, as he was unable to lie down in bed, until he used wild plum bark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Go out into the woods and gather a quantity of this natural remedy; it may save you or your loved ones much suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bladder Troubles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I want to tell you something about a common weed called horsetail grass. It’s an herb that the Indians highly prized for kidney and bladder troubles, especially in cases of gravel. An old pharmacist from Wisconsin recently told us that, used as a strong tea, horsetail grass was his favorite remedy for gravel. As a wash for wounds and ulcers, the decoction has also been found very effective. It is a powerful astringent and has a strong tendency to stop bleeding internally and externally. For nose bleeding, the tea or decoction is snuffed into the nostrils, with almost immediate effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These plants grew along the dykes of Holland and helped to strengthen them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the days when pewter was used exclusively and patent cleaners were unknown, housewives found these plants a great aid in scouring. This undoubtedly is the reason it is called pewterwort and scouring rush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Horsetail grass, or scouring rush, is rich in organic minerals, especially lime, which is essential to good teeth and strong bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make the tea, steep a teaspoonful of the plant in a cup of boiling water. Drink cold, one or two cupfuls a day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Colic, Cramps</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The western tribes of American Indians, since time immemorial, have used prickly ash, or hantola, with excellent results in the treatment of rheumatism, colic, cramps and allied complaints. Prickly ash, or hantola, blooms in April and May, before the appearance of leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a reliable diaphoretic, producing sweating in profusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For rheumatism, I advise using prickly ash in a tea, with a mixture of burdock, black cohosh and poke-root in equal parts. This mixture has proved to be a very effective remedy for rheumatism, lumbago, gout and backache. It has brought speedy relief so many times that I do not hesitate in recommending it to the sufferers of these maladies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is made by mixing equal parts of prickly ash, burdock, black cohosh and poke-root together, placing a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in a teacupful of boiling water and allowing it to stand until cool. Strain and drink a mouthful of the tea several times a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the pains are severe and the limbs swollen, it is well to supplement the tea treatment with an external application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prickly ash bark is also used in blood purifiers. I doubt if there is a blood purifier on the market that doesn’t contain a certain amount of prickly ash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The taste of prickly ash is not very pleasant, but that can be overcome by adding any amount of licorice root desired to your herb mixture. Licorice root or sweet root should be kept on hand at all times and used liberally in any medicine that does not taste well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Incontinence of Urine, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yarrow is found everywhere. There are uses without end for this plant, many of them imaginative. As a medicine it has legends that claim cures for all ills the flesh is heir to. While this is mostly superstitious folklore, it is known that this plant has real medicinal value. It is astringent, alterative and diuretic, and most highly valued as an adjunct in the treatment of hemorrhages, incontinence of urine, diabetes, piles, dysentery and flatulence. The head bathed in a decoction of yarrow prevents the hair from falling out; while the leaves chewed in the mouth will frequently ease toothache. During the Civil War this herb was used as a substitute for quinine in fevers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The decoction is made by steeping a teaspoonful of the herb, cut small or granulated, in a cup of boiling water. Drink cold the cupful during the day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This plant, with its fern-like leaves and white or rose-colored flowers, is a native of Europe, England and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(To </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">be continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font6"> FACTOR of outstanding importance and interest in the world today is the public library. Its usefulness and the beneficial effects it may have upon the people generally is not open to question. The diffusion of knowledge is a good thing. It is only necessary to remember that the most oppressive and reactionary institutions have thrived as a result of the suppression of knowledge to agree that libraries are an unquestionable, though not always an unqualified, boon to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The wide use of libraries presupposes the ability of the people to read, an accomplishment which only in recent times has become a common rather than an uncommon thing. The illiterate person is the exception rather than the rule, though in countries dominated by Catholicism illiteracy is not considered unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A library is a collection of books, arranged in some kind of order. It speaks eloquently of man’s thirst for knowledge. As an institution it is almost as old as the postdiluvian world, a fact which is evidenced by the discovery of libraries which existed about the time of Abraham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is believed to be the most ancient library in the world, consisting of documents written in the first alphabetic signs known, was discovered a few years ago in Syria at Ras-Shamra, among the ruins of an old Phoenician palace. Another library has been unearthed at the site of the ancient city of Harahoto, in the heart of Mongolia. A collection of 2,500 volumes, in seven languages, and some 350 pictures, are said to have been found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An expedition to Kish on behalf of Oxford University discovered an important library of cuneiform tablets, including grammars, dictionaries and commentaries on the Sumerian and Babylonian languages. Another library of tablets was found at Nippur, or Nineveh, which in turn gave clues to a still older library at Ur, Abraham’s birthplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Mexican library has been discovered near the city of Mexico which is believed to have been the product of a civilization preceding the Aztecs. Its antiquity was estimated to be 7,000 years. This is exaggerated, as many supposedly scientific guesses have been proved to be. The library is made up of stone tablets, engraved and colored in a characteristic manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Ancient Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Egypt, according to all available records, also early made use of the library. Papyrus rolls and stone or clay tablets were the mediums used to preserve knowledge, collections being kept in temples and palaces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ancient Greece had libraries at a very early date. The Grecians made use of waxed tablets, papyrus and parchment for recording information which they wished to preserve for future use. The most famous of Grecian libraries was the one at Alexandria, containing a total of as many as 700,000 volumes, according to some authorities. The destruction of this library is usually laid to the Arabs who took Alexandria under the Caliph Omar in 641, but it is also contended that its destruction was accomplished by fanatic “Christians” at an earlier date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another famous Greek library was located at Pergamon, where, two centuries before the Christian era, Greek civilization reached a high level of material prosperity. Eumenes II, the son of the founder of this library, manifested his love of learning and knowledge by searching throughout the then-known world for texts of all sorts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Romans, less devoted to learning than to war, began to collect libraries only after the wars with Greece. The Palatine Library was built in two parts, one containing Greek books of merit, and the other part devoted to Latin literature. Later public libraries were favored, so much so that in the fourth century there were as many as 28 in Rome alone. The Romans are credited with being the originators of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">public </span><span class="font6">library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The division of the empire retarded the further development of libraries. The Romans lost interest in Greek literature and the Greeks neglected Latin books. At that date, too, the already apostate Christian church had gained considerable influence and fanatics are held responsible for the destruction of many valuable collections of ancient writings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is probable that the otherwise unaccountable eclipse of learning and cessation of progress which ensued is due to the misapprehension and perversion of the teachings of Scripture, the doctrine of eternal torment resulting in the loss of interest in all things of material benefit and laying its blighting pall upon all human endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medieval Times</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The desire for knowledge and love of learning were not wholly destroyed, however, though now directed into other channels. Libraries of the Dark Ages, often connected with monasteries, contained books devoted mainly to theological subjects, so called, and amid a vast amount of nonsense a measure of knowledge and many valuable ancient manuscripts were preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the theological, or rather, ecclesiastical works, were palimpsests, that is, books written upon parchment which had been previously used, and from which the earlier writings had been erased. It has been possible to decipher some of these more ancient writings, the erasures not having been a complete success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic church has been charged with suppressing the Bible by causing it to be literally kept in chains. This charge is not wholly correct, however. The suppression of the Bible, and its most precious truths, was accomplished by more subtle and effective methods. A vast accumulation of legends and ecclesiastical opinions were permitted and encouraged gradually to crowd out the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chaining of books and Bibles in the medieval libraries was a means of their protection. (A modern example is the “chained” directory at a public telephone booth.) Books were rare, valuable and large in those days, all being produced by hand and, in the opinion of some, “worth stealing.” Hence the chain, which secured each book to its proper place on the sloping shelf which served as a table from which the book must be read in a standing position. Later, printed books appeared, but even these were for a time sent to the chain-gang. The chains were attached to rods which were fixed to the wall or posts above the shelves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The library at Hereford still preserves the chained books, the benches and shelves upon which they originally rested having been restored. Several libraries retained the chain arrangement until the middle of the eighteenth century. Those that still remain are preserved only as curiosities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Medieval libraries, as a rule, were not very extensive, the subjects discussed in the books being chiefly theology, philosophy, medicine, logic, grammar, history and canon law. In the Middle Ages a few hundred books made a fair library. People had to stand while reading, and the libraries were little used, which is not strange, considering the subject matter of the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were, however, some libraries of great size. It is recorded that Corvinus, of Hungary, in the fifteenth century, established a library containing more than 50,000 manuscripts. It was scattered to all parts of Europe when the Turks rifled its halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the Arabs loose-leaf libraries were in favor. They contained, as a rule, mainly works on theology, jurisprudence and philology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ivan the Terrible, czar of Russia in the sixteenth century, had a vast collection of manuscripts, among them many of great value and antiquity. This library is lost. No one knows what became of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vatican Library</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Vatican Library as now constituted dates from the fifteenth century when Tommaso Pa-rentucelli became “pope” (1447-1455). The library was greatly increased by him and his successors and was finally housed in suitable apartments in the Vatican. Today this library ranks first among the libraries of the world because of the importance of the materials it contains. Thousands of very ancient and valuable manuscripts are among its treasures, which are added to frequently by the bequests of private libraries. Additionally there are halls extravagantly decorated with rich frescoes and paintings, filled with treasures of art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only recently (February 8, 1932) a hundred thousand books and documents dating back to the first century were transferred from the private library of one of the foremost families in Italy to the Vatican Library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1927 representatives of the Vatican Library came to America to study the library system employed in the Library of Congress. Methods employed in the Vatican Library were obsolete and inadequate, and access to many of its most ancient documents was practically impossible. American equipment has been installed in the library and a new cataloguing system has also been arranged, financed in part by the Carnegie endowment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The building in which the library is housed is five hundred years old, and a part of it collapsed in 1931, causing the death of three workmen and a lawyer. Some of the valuable manuscripts were destroyed, as well as many books of lesser value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">British Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England, as in other parts of Europe, libraries during the Dark Ages and the medieval period were largely the by-product of religious institutions which were active in copying and preserving the ancient manuscripts of the Bible and commentaries thereon. Incidentally they preserved some other books. Later the universities began to collect libraries. National and public libraries are a subsequent development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford ranks next to the Vatican Library in the matter of rare books and manuscripts. A copy of every copyrighted book published in the United Kingdom is given to the library. The Rockefeller Foundation has contributed the sum of $2,300,000 toward the enlargement of this library, which is an important contributor to the cause of learning and increase of knowledge, and therefore international in its influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a library connected with Westminster Abbey containing one of the largest and most important collections of medieval and later manuscripts in Britain. Inadequate space prevents their being as useful as they might be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Largest and best known, however, of British libraries is the British Museum Library, containing nearly 4,000,000 books, stored on fifty miles of shelves. Before 1875, when the present reading room was opened, the books were consulted by perhaps a half-dozen readers daily. Readers now average 700 a day. The catalogue of books requires almost a thousand volumes. Once a year the library indulges in a great cleaning orgy, though the systematic dusting of books goes on throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Carlyle could not find in mid-Victorian London the books he wanted for his work, he created a library, which today is the London Library, containing about a half million books. Louis Napoleon, when in exile, frequently visited this library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not all the precious books in London are at the British Museum. The one at South Kensington boasts many fine first editions of famous authors, such as Shakespeare and Dickens, as well as important manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of making of many libraries, as of books, there is no end. It would be impossible to mention even the most famous and the largest of them in this article, and an attempt to be exhaustive would only be exhausting to the reader. Suffice it to say that Britain has libraries galore, and it is safe to conclude, judging from the disposition of the English people, that they are freely used by all classes. According to the manager of one of Britain’s largest lending libraries, however, women are greater readers than men. They probably have more time. He advises further that ‘‘highbrow” men often delight in “lowbrow” literature. It appears that they seek relaxation in books which will hold their interest without demanding close concentration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even prisons have their libraries in these days of great ‘enlightenment’. In Britain the prisoners seem often to be of the more intelligent kind, judging from the fact that the works of Shakespeare and Shaw are in greatest demand. This may prove that education is making headway among criminals or that crime is making progress among the educated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Libraries of noted men are generally subjects of interest. After 200 years a considerable portion of Sir Isaac Newton’s library has been brought to light. Most of the books have the corners turned down to passages in which the scientist was specially interested. This will enable students to trace back some of his thoughts and ideas to their sources. Out of 1,896 books, over 800 have been recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last and least of England’s libraries (from the standpoint of size), though by no means least from the standpoint of interest and value, is the Queen’s Library for Dolls, a part of the famous Doll-house which has some of the most elaborate and beautiful of furnishings. The library is composed of first editions of miniature books, expressly written for the doll’s library by Britain’s leading authors. There are some 200 books in the collection, each about 1 by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1/<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font6">inches in size, and beautifully bound. Because of the limited first edition of these books, their value is out of all proportion to their size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">France, Belgium, Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Crossing the channel, we pause to take a look at France’s Biblioteque Nationale, or National Library, reputed to be the largest in the world and containing in excess of four million books and eleven thousand manuscripts. The constantly increasing stock of books is crowding the building to capacity. In addition to the books and manuscripts the library has thousands of maps, engravings and medals. A map by Christopher Columbus, recently discovered in the library, pictures the earth as an island surrounded by four oceans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Belgium the library of the Louvain university invites attention. The old library, with its valuable contents, was destroyed by the Germans during the World War, and a new one has been built to take its place, mainly from contributions from American universities, at a cost of $1,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">War has destroyed, without discrimination, everything that has come in its path. Libraries in great number were destroyed when the Danes overran England, and the same fate has met the libraries of many other countries in times of war. United States soldiers destroyed the library at York (now Toronto) during the War of 1812, and the British considerately burned the Library of Congress, in Washington. That made it about even.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A heated controversy raged over the inscription which the architect had planned for the new Louvain Library, “Destroyed by German Fury, Restored by American Generosity.” The inscription was regarded by many as tending to perpetuate the animosities of the war. The “patriotic” citizens of Louvain, however, insisted that the inscription must remain, and a mob twice destroyed a balustrade substituted for the one with the inscription. A mob shows little sense in either war or peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Germany has been required to give to the library books and manuscripts equaling in value those destroyed by her soldiers in the war. Many universities and scientific institutions have contributed books to the new library, which already has 750,000 volumes on its shelves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the central figure of the facade there appears a sculpture of a woman with a child, called “Our Lady of Victory”, and bearing a sword and wearing a helmet. “Our lady” has been forced into so many incongruous poses and attitudes that students of the Bible fail to find any correspondency between the virgin so vociferously worshiped by Catholics as “the mother of God” and the humble Mary who referred to herself as the ‘handmaiden of the Lord’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Germany lays claim to the largest library building in the world, the Prussian State Library, at Berlin, which has a floor space of about 20,000 square yards and is fifteen stories high. An outstanding feature of this library is its large collection of tomes of music, of which there are a million. Many of the books are loaned to foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The family library of the Hohenzollerns, about 100,000 volumes and many maps and musical publications, has been taken over by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Elsewhere in Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lenin Library, at Moscow, is one of the greatest libraries in the world. There are 5,100,000 volumes on its shelves. Its main reading rooms are used by about 500,000 persons a year. There are 300,000 books in the military section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would seem much like repetition to mention the libraries of other European countries. Each has libraries of importance and interest and all bear witness to the desire of men to obtain and preserve knowledge on every conceivable subject. The field is unlimited, and the circle of knowledge ever widens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In America</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About 200 years ago Benjamin Franklin organized the first circulating library in America. (At that time people who desired to read had to send to England for their books.) Fifty men agreed to pay an initial forty shillings each and ten shillings per annum, and they had the privilege of taking out books. Others, however, were permitted to read the books in the library room, which was open for four hours on Saturday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The idea was soon adopted by other towns and provinces, and the people having no public amusements to divert their minds became acquainted with books and were observed by visitors to be better educated than people of the same class in other countries generally were. Since then the library has become an important factor in adult education in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total circulation for all the libraries in the country in 1929 was estimated to be 114,000,-000. The New York Public Library (not including Brooklyn and Queens, which have their own library systems) issued 11,684,160 books for circulation during 1930 and 2,239,455 readers consulted 4,796,068 books in the reference department, aside from thousands of volumes accessible on the open shelves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Almost every large city in the United States has a fine library housed in a beautiful and classic building. We have space for comment on only a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York Public Library and the Library of Congress at Washington (equally public) rank among the great libraries of the world. The first mentioned is a consolidation of the Astor, Lenox and Tilden libraries, to which other libraries have been added from time to time. The consolidated library now has upward of 3,000,000 books and pamphlets and has an extensive collection of books on American history. Its easy accessibility and wide use is one of its chief claims to commendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Congressional Library, not as exclusive as its name seems to suggest, is naturally more important than the New York Public Library, and possesses a larger number of valuable books and manuscripts. It contains over 3,000,000 printed books and pamphlets, as well as maps, prints, charts, engravings and lithographs numbering 2,650,000. It is a storehouse of authentic American historic papers and documents, maps and pictures. A million musical items are another notable feature, and it does not lack ancient and rare manuscripts and incunabula (books printed before A.D. 1500).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An unusual collection of books now in the possession of this library is one which was brought together by Houdini, the magician, numbering 5,147. The majority of these are on “psychical research” or spiritism. The library also has some 15,000 Japanese books and a complete set of Chinese classics, comprising 74 volumes, each </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8 1/<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font6"> by 13 inches, with sixty large characters on each page. The originals of these classics were written before our A.D. date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The library began with 740 volumes, in 1801, and since then, by bequests, donations and purchases, has grown to its present proportions, being housed adequately in an imposing structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To aid students doing research work the Congressional Library employs eleven consultants, each in a small office of his own and each a specialist in his field. One who has a worthwhile object in view to which he purposes to devote some time doing research work may be given the exclusive use of a room or desk to which will be brought whatever books he requires. Fifty-five special rooms are set aside for this purpose. There will be 166 when the new addition to the library is completed. From this it will be seen that this splendid library not only has a vast collection of sources of information, but is also equipped to make it readily available to inquiring minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Worthy of note, and frequently consulted by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> is the Brooklyn Public Library, housed in an inadequate building, but rendering efficient service. Some of its activities serve as an example of work done by American libraries generally, with such variations as local conditions call for. The department of library extension furnishes books to about seventy fire houses and police stations. During 1931, 19,000 volumes were used by firemen and policemen during periods of inactivity, while waiting for calls to action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The library has 34 branches and receives from the city a million dollars yearly to carry on its activities. It has a unique collection of fashion magazines, dating back over a century, which are used by illustrators and dress designers in their work and are found to be of value in designing costumes for moving pictures and stage plays. The books in the music collection, over* 15,000 pieces, are circulated just like other books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Boston Public Library was one of the first American free public libraries, and for a long time occupied the place of first importance. It assumed second place after the merger of the various foundations of the New York library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chicago Public Library occupies a position next to that of New York and Boston. This library contains chiefly books that will appeal to the general public rather than to the scholar. The Newberry Library of the same city serves the student of literature; and the John Crerar Library, students of science and the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shakespearean Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So highly is Shakespeare esteemed among men that special libraries have been built containing only books and articles relating to him and his writings. One of these is the Horace Howard Furness Memorial, at Philadelphia, containing a collection of about 12,000 volumes, some of them rare. Another is the Folger Library, in Washington, a gift to the nation by Mr. Folger and endowed by him with ten million dollars. A beautiful building has been erected, housing books, manuscripts, engravings, paintings, statuary, programs and other interesting items relating to Shakespeare. The collection is valued at four million dollars. Copies of Shakespeare once the possession of noted men and women are a valued part of the collection. In this we see an example of that awe which man has for man, and which the Scriptures condemn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Canada and Elsewhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are numerous libraries in Canada, but none of them as large as to have reached the million mark. All of the larger cities have free libraries, and frontier settlements are reached by means of traveling libraries under the management of the provincial governments or universities. Large wooden boxes holding from 40 to 500 books are sent, express charges paid, in response to an application of some responsible citizen on behalf of the community. When the books have been read the readers pay return charges. There are 1,250 of these libraries in operation, and 62,500 books available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Brazil there is no such thing as a public library. In Sao Paulo there are two reference libraries, but they do not lend books to be taken out. South America has few libraries. It is Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Libraries are to be found in such remote countries as Australia, Japan, China, and India, and in Africa. Indeed all of these have made much progress in establishing and developing libraries. In China there were libraries at a very early date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Usefulness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to make the best use of the libraries possible to the many the American Library Association has published courses entitled “Reading with a Purpose”, 500,000 of which have been distributed in this country and in Canada. These courses, of which there are more than fifty, are an outgrowth of the Adult Education Movement, and enable the reader to do instructive as well as interesting reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Libraries and their librarians generally strive to meet the needs of the locality in which they are located, whether it be an industrial community or an agricultural one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many are the questions that people in all walks of life ask librarians. Questions as to the dates of certain events, or what to wear to and in some country to which the questioner is going, are answered by the librarian. Business men submit questions of importance in their businesses. For instance: What is the average rate of labor turnover in abusiness office? Would it pay a clothing man to settle in San Antonio, Texas? What is a fur called pahmi? Cost of living figures for a landlady who wished to change her rates ? It is true that women spend 90 percent of all money in the United States? How many shiploads of sugar would 140 carloads make? How many cigarettes were smoked in Minnesota last year? Do hairdressers have to have licenses in Denver? What is the purchasing power of the dollar now? What are the initials of the First National Bank president at Rochester ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These questions indicate how useful a library may be made. On the whole, librarians and their assistants are found to be courteous and willing to assist, and in not a few instances they are anxious to extend the usefulness of the material under their direction. Many inquiries are answered direct, or the inquirer may be assisted to find the answer to his question by means of the conveniently arranged index to be found in every library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the New York library there are 300,000 volumes in the economics division, and twenty trained librarians who answer questions briefly or supply the book that will answer the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The business man is not the only one who can put the library to profitable use. Housewives can obtain books on cooking, housekeeping, sewing, and on raising children (and perhaps husbands). “Bread, cake and pie have a literature as well as poetry and the stars,” reads a bulletin of the Newark Public Library, and “a public library is as rich in one as the other and likes to be called on for both.” Not many subjects take up more space on the index cards of the New York Public Library than that of cookery. There is even a book on “The Philosophy of Cooking”, and no end of cook books of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reading for Pleasure</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the library can thus be put to most practical and profitable use, a great many people think of it more as a means of furnishing material for pleasure and entertainment. Books which rest the mind and beguile the reader for a brief hour are not unworthy of a place on the shelves. It is to be feared, however, that far more reading for pleasure is done than is for the readers’ good. To spend all one’s spare time in reading what is merely fiction and what will not contribute to the mental equipment of the reader is a mistake. Reading for profit can be done with pleasure; for many highly profitable books are written in entertaining style, and while the reader follows the author’s thought he imbibes knowledge and gathers information which will stand him in good stead at another time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nor should reading be done in a slipshod manner, but with attention and care; and it is a good idea, when reading (except books of the lightest trend), to make an effort to recall at the conclusion of a paragraph or page what was discussed, fixing in mind what has been read and at the same time resting the eyes while looking away from the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Librarians are put to some trouble trying to determine what books from among the thousands that make their appearance every year shall be given a place on the shelves. Thumbing long lists of new books has enabled the librarians to develop some resistance to their appeal. They sift and weigh and give the patrons of the library good advice and, says one paper, “almost weep when readers insist on rubbish.” However, even at the chance of reading some rubbish, readers can not and should not submit too readily to what someone else says should be read, and refuse to read what others may say should not be read. Sometimes libraries institute a censorship that is not warranted, and under the influence of prejudice and intolerance try to dictate the reading of others. Intelligent men and women are capable of judging for themselves as to their reading needs, and if any are not they would not profit greatly by having their mental provender regulated by some selfappointed censor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bergenfield and the Archbishop of Tuam</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bergenfield, N. J., somewhat notorious because of its intolerance toward and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, gained publicity a short time ago as having a self-appointed censorship committee, which was charged with “assuming the power of a censor in a public institution” and fixing an arbitrary ban on books blacklisted by the committee. The woman who entered a protest questioned the committee’s right to destroy books which it did not approve. The woman should be listed as a “protestant”. There are a few of these left in Bergenfield, we hope. Among other things against which the committee set its face and upon which it laid violent hands were books that “scored the Christian </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">religion”.</span><span class="font6"> The report does not state what brand of “Christian” religion was under fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England, too, the censor’s head occasionally protrudes from cover, an indiscreet thing for a censor to permit. We read, “The Committee of the County Galway Public Libraries is working under a drastic and, apparently, autocratic censorship of its own setting up.” Do not be alarmed, dear reader, at this, for “the Archbishop of Tuam acts as censor for this body”, and, of course, “his judgments are accepted without revision or question.” Indeed the whole item is so delectable that we cannot forbear quoting the rest. Medieval history is apparently not entirely closed. “Recently upon the Archbishop’s condemnation a number of books have been burned, and it is evident from a report of the Libraries Committee on Tuesday that at least one member of the Committee [bless his soul!] is not easy in his mind about the sanity or propriety of these proceedings. The Committee </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">object to the publication of a list of the destroyed books.” (!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Germany there has been a controversy over the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">All Quiet on the Western Front. </span><span class="font6">Those who still believe that unpleasant truths should be suppressed have insisted that the book should be removed from school libraries. The sole consideration, however, should be whether the book is suitable reading for young persons or not. The facts set forth in the book, whether pleasant or unpleasant, remain facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few years ago Mayor Thompson of Chicago threatened to burn all the pro-British books in the public library of that city in a bonfire at the lake front. The threat was never carried out, perhaps because of lack of material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Much Unprofitable Reading</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One well known editor observes that a third of the reading generally done is helpful, a third harmful, and another third is useful as a sedative drug. It is to be doubted that the label “sedative” can be limited to only a third of the reading done. He says, “We have been filling our shelves with cheap new lamps in place of the good old ones.” Another writer remarks, “There is a great deal of miscellaneous knowledge in the air, but a real love of the things of the spirit—that is quite another matter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fiction in a world in which it is so hard to get at the truth seems not to deserve much consideration. It presents a distorted view of life, almost invariably. Even books that are considered sober presentations of fact contain enough of “fiction” to supply every reader a goodly dose of that questionable mental pabulum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Advice coming from librarians is of value, particularly if the advice is impartially given and not the result of religious prejudice. The attitude of the censor is negative, destructive, intolerant. People willing enough to accept advice resent the attitude of the censor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Progressive Library</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In marked contrast to the reactionary and negative attitude of the library at Bergenfield stands the progressive work of another New Jersey library, the one at Newark. The Newark Library is a cheerful place that makes people welcome and seeks to serve them to the utmost. After all, the people own the library. In Newark they may browse freely among the thousands of books on the shelves of the stackroom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The librarian says, “We believe that a library should let its light shine. If it has information and material needed by the world, it should advertise and keep on advertising. The very essence of the service of a public institution is the public’s knowledge of the service that institution can give. Such an institution, moreover, should be flexible, unhampered by outworn notions, and ready to step in with its help in any field of activity. . . . From the library print shop go thousands of pieces of printed matter yearly as a contribution to the educational life of the city. Countless opportunities are found to attract and assist the seeker after knowledge who is not being formally educated. In addition the resources of the library are at the command of all teachers. In this morning’s mail we found 101 requests from the schools. The requests have been filled, and our books, maps, pictures and magazines will be in the hands of the teachers and children tomorrow. More than 1200 classrooms in the city are little branches of the library, supplied with books from our shelves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The library has further extended its usefulness by establishing branches in two department stores, enabling many readers to obtain books while doing shopping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To bring in delinquent books the library recently declared a no-fine week, during which 1200 books were returned. It would have been almost impossible to get these back otherwise, failure to return having resulted in the accumulation of considerable fines, which the people felt unable to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Drifting with the Stream</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An immense amount of reading is done with no particular purpose in mind, not even with the idea of acquiring a fund of miscellaneous knowledge. To keep in touch, even partially, with the course of things in general is no simple task, and much of that which is passed to the people is hardly worth the reading. The imbibing of information and opinions of all kinds, and the consequent shaping of one’s viewpoint, can be effectively directed into proper channels only by constant recourse to the Book of books, the Bible, and the use of those helps which enable us to appreciate its application to our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demand in the libraries for books of one kind or another is more or less governed by currents. Thus about ten years ago, immediately following the war, there was an unusual demand for spiritistic literature, which has since subsided. The libraries are, to a considerable extent, influenced by public demand, whether that demand be for good or for ill. A clearer definition of the purpose of a library might serve to make its influence for constructive thinking more widely felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To use the library merely as a means to entertain the idle hours with reading of unprofitable books seems a waste of public funds, and then to deny the facilities of the library to those who are patently putting forth an effort to use it properly seems too bad. Thus the New York Public Library some time ago felt called upon to deny its facilities to high school and college students, because of being overcrowded. If there is cutting down to be done it might, in the opinion of some people, be more properly done in the fiction department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A large part of the time and energy of librarians is devoted to supplying fiction to people who are not interested in improving their minds. Says one professor in protest, “Let the guardians of our public libraries be freed from the futile task of serving out over the counter the canned goods of literature to people who are not even interested in the different brands of canned goods. . . . Let our librarians be free to devote themselves to their real job, of bringing together the right book and the right reader, the reader who sincerely wishes to fly and the book that can truly give the spirit wings.” There is considerable demand that the amount of fiction in the libraries be greatly reduced and that books and journals dealing with science, invention, government and history be increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To aid the searcher for knowledge a readers’ advisory service is provided by the libraries of a number of the larger cities, and one library at least has added a college professor in this capacity. Grouped about this experienced educator are experts of the regular staff of the library, planning reading courses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Methods of Running Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The main object of a library is to file books in some sort of order and to make them readily available to the right people. It may have other sources of information as well as books, such as maps, charts, pictures, and even objects of art and industry which might ordinarily be expected only in a museum, but books are a library’s main concern. In order to properly handle the books, therefore, so as to serve the public efficiently, the library is obliged to maintain files that will make access to the books most convenient. The system for classifying books that is now in use in almost all libraries is that invented by Melvil Dewey, a system which is said to be capacious enough to make room for all the books that have been written and printed and flexible enough to admit all the books that may yet be produced. Millions of books bear his decimal brand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The index cards that list the books, and of which there are thousands upon thousands in all the large libraries, contain a brief description of the books and their contents. Each book is properly classified. Numerous books, of course, appear in more than one category. It is the practice in most systems of filing to file behind the index letter. This is the method used in the Library of Congress and followed by most such institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To make books attractive to the eye the New York Public Library adopted the scheme of dressing them up in gay bindings. Surely that is a good plan. There is no reason why books, the medium of so much enjoyment, should be dressed in somber garb. Some thirty bright new colors have been adopted in a recently discovered material that will not show fingerprints, can be washed easily, and is not expensive. In experimenting at one of the libraries a large group of old books, long neglected by readers looking for something new, were dressed up in bright purple. When returned to their places on the open shelves they were quickly spied out and kept in constant use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Brooklyn Library has conducted library training courses for the training of library workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Incidental Activities</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Behind the scenes in many of the libraries a force is kept busy repairing the books and looking after rare works. Officials are concerned about future generations that may need the crumbling irreplaceable volumes of today. Numerous devices are being employed to combat the injury resulting from the handling of the books. Precious manuscripts are kept in reserve and brought out only for approved purposes. Rare books are accessible only under supervision. Some may not be touched by readers’ hands. An attendant turns the pages at his signal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The life of the ordinary book in the stacks is estimated at one hundred trips. A hundred more trips will reduce its pages to illegibility. Some 45,000 books at the New York Public Library are rebound each year. Leather bindings are not as durable as cloth. They crumble more quickly. Buckram is preferred as more durable than either leather or ordinary cloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Libraries often conduct exhibits of some of the rarer and more unusual items in their treasuries. An exhibit of miniature books, for instance, will attract quite a few interested persons. Exhibitions of other special collections also arouse considerable interest. Out of exhibits of dime novels, baseball items and Bibles, the latter attracted twice as many interested persons as the first two. It was one of the most popular exhibits held in the library in New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Maintenance</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Libraries are financed and maintained out of public funds and donations of various kinds. In the largest cities the cost of the libraries runs into the millions. A large part of this often comes from endowments. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., recently gave two millions for the erection of a library for the League of Nations, dealing especially with international problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1923 the New York Public Library received a gift of six million dollars from three gentlemen who seemed to be able to spare the money. Quite often it seems that these gifts are somewhat along the lines of the old adage, “Robbing Peter to pay Paul.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gifts of smaller sums and of books and private libraries also contribute to maintaining and enlarging the libraries. A year or two ago someone donated three hundred sets of Booth Tarkington, 21 volumes to the set, to the public libraries in New York and other cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Penny fines collected from those who keep books overtime also add a little to the libraries’ treasuries. The East Cleveland Public Library was enabled some years ago to purchase adjoining property, valued at $8,000, out of the money collected as fines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some people jump with joy when they receive a gift, but librarians sometimes jump with rage. Most donors have strings tied to their gifts, even when they say they desire no special recognition. Often conditions are attached that make it impossible to accept the gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Frenchman at 65 gave property worth a million to Columbia University, requesting only that an annuity be paid him for the rest of his life. The favor was accepted with thanks and the gentleman collected his sixty thousand for 29 years thereafter! Figure that one out for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To obtain important papers that may be of value to future historians the New York Public Library has adopted the policy of getting these from immediate relatives of noted men shortly after their death. A growing number of public men, realizing that the library has the facilities for the care and administration of such material, are placing their files of letters and papers in its hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The law provides that one library may be designated by each representative and senator as a depository to receive all government publications if desired. A different mode of handling these publications has been recommended in order that the depositories may be well distributed and so serve the needs of the people most effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">University Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The universities were among the first institutions to form large collections of books, and today some of the most important libraries are connected with universities. Among the oldest is the Cambridge University Library in England, which existed before 1425. It now has about a million volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still more famous is the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It was opened to the public in 1602, with 2,000 volumes. Universities at Edinburgh and Saint Andrews, Scotland, and Dublin, Ireland, also have large libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of the university libraries in the United States contain unique collections. Columbia University boasts the possession of four folios of German post-war paper money, much of it luxuriously designed and some of the notes reproductions of fifteenth century works of art. Columbia started the first school for training librarians, in 1887.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yale University last year dedicated a new library, containing 2,000,000 volumes, and built at a cost of $7,000,000 from funds given to the university by John W. Sterling, for whom the library is named. It is one of America’s outstanding structures. Sculptured panels depicting the history of literature and printing adorn the exterior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yale is reported to have the most complete collection of Ruskin in the United States, including the manuscript of a poem written at nine, his first published work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Princeton University Library has a collection of books and pamphlets totaling 770,000; which is not bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is plenty of reading material in Harvard’s library. It is estimated that the shelves contain over 3,000 tons of books, or a total of 3,168,390 volumes. The Chinese library alone has 47,775 books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Book Publishers Research Institute discloses that Wellesley College alumnae read four times as much fiction as serious books. Which shows that college graduates are much like other people, only more so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Hoover War Library at Stanford University has been gathering materials bearing upon the World War. The work of collecting will continue for twenty-five years. During that period certain secret items will be kept sealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unemployment and the Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Unemployment has greatly increased the patronage of the libraries. The want-ad columns in the newspapers in the reading rooms are consulted by large numbers. Never before have demands on libraries for practical help been so great. People turn to them for books that will help them improve their ability along the lines of their work or acquire new knowledge for new jobs. The increased leisure has also resulted in a larger demand for fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year witnessed an increase of 30,000 readers in the Toronto Public Library, assumed to be due to unemployment. A news item remarks, “This fact is a sufficient answer to the frequent query, What would workingmen do with the leisure which shorter hours of work would give them?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Leading newspapers print a special rag-paper edition for libraries. These far outlast the regular wood-pulp-paper editions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Incidentally, the back files of newspapers are chiefly consulted for accounts of murders. The interest is said to be professional and scientific rather than morbid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Comparisons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American library is Tor the people’, while in Europe the aim has been to preserve the books. This ideal, however, is giving way to the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6">erican one. A professor of English literature from an Italian university, visiting the United States, remarked, “American libraries are wonderful, not merely in the books which they contain, but especially in the ideal from which they emanate, the ideal of books as a useful means of disseminating knowledge. . . . They are wonderful in their functioning, with their small branches that reach into remote neighborhoods and distant regions, their children’s rooms, their business and industrial sections, their easy classification methods and open shelving, which make large numbers of useful books readily accessible to the reader. . . . The libraries of Italy and Europe contain many unique treasures. . . . Books may be withdrawn from these libraries, but the red tape involved is often most discouraging.” The chief librarian of Munich said, “Any European visiting the public libraries of New York or Chicago must turn green with envy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Europe the library service is usually in the hands of elderly men and the number of attendants is less than a tenth of those employed in United States libraries, where boys and girls are numerous because they get about more quickly, and, under proper supervision, can do the work quite as well as older persons. Service in American libraries is rendered in a fraction of the time required in Europe. The director general of the French National Library recommended the immediate expansion of the French library system after having seen American libraries. The American system is being universally adopted. A deputation from England spoke warmly of the courtesy of American librarians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Abuses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are persons whose lack of sense, decency and responsibility makes itself known wherever they go. They mar, deface or destroy everything with which they come in contact. They take clippings from newspaper files, magazines and books, make gratuitous comment on what they find in the books, by the use of pen or pencil, underscore what pleases them, cross out what does not suit their fancy, and remove pictures that appeal to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Such abuse of public property is a crime and punishable by fine or imprisonment. Now and again someone is arrested as a result of being caught mutilating books or papers in the library ; but many of these destroyers are clever enough to know that punishment awaits them if their work is observed, hence they do it unobserved. Special investigators are on duty in many public libraries to apprehend those who commit such crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally someone is caught who makes it a practice to increase his personal income by stealing and selling valuable and rare books. One individual of this stamp was found with $7,000 worth of stolen books in his possession. He had already made away with books valued at $43,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are people who find other uses for libraries than that of increasing their fund of knowledge. They, unlawfully, use the checking room to take care of an inconvenient parcel or umbrella, leaving by another door to return later. Others come in merely to use the telephone, or to rest on the benches in the halls. Occasionally the comfortable chairs are used as a place to snooze, but an attendant usually ends the nap prematurely. Corridor benches not too prominently placed or too well lighted serve as lovers’ retreats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">County Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the wide distribution of public libraries in the United States, there are millions of people without library service. More than 40,000,000 of these live on farms or in towns and villages of 2,500 or less. Effort is being made to reach these people by means of county libraries, which are proving to be of great value to the village and rural districts. These libraries generally operate from a central location in the county or from a town which marks the center of population. Branches or deposit stations are located at points of advantage throughout the county, and these are supplied with books and magazines from the county library. This arrangement is similar to the operation of city libraries and their branches and deposit stations. It would probably be hard to find a rustic now who would express himself as one in days gone by is reported to have done. Said he, “I ain’t never seen one of them free libraries, but from what I hears about ’em, a half of the books in ’em ain’t never read, and the other half never ought to be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Traveling Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To educate the masses at all costs and in some fashion, traveling libraries have been instituted to reach those who live in out-of-the-way places. The library takes to the open road, stops at remote schools, post offices, deposit stations and even homes, and delivers wanted books, to be collected later when others will be left to take their place. Some of the trucks have glass doors, displaying shelves filled with books. The librarian, frequently a young lady, has to be versatile enough to run the truck as well as the library. Outlying sections of large cities are served in a similar way. The New York Public Library regularly sends out a library car carrying 2,000 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The traveling library in America was begun at Hagerstown, Md., in 1902. Books were sent to surrounding small towns by means of a bookwagon which distributed and collected books at regular intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Libraries Abroad</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So much is the library a part of the life of the American that he will not do without it even when abroad. Consequently American libraries are found in some of the larger cities of Europe. The American library in Paris is located at 10 Rue L’Elysee. It was founded in 1918 by the American Library Association and is supported largely by grants and special gifts. Not only Americans, but many European students of English, appreciate the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a splendid American library at Athens, Greece, housed in a beautiful building. It is part of the American School of Classical Learning in that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American library in Rome was established “to make it possible for the public in Italy to obtain precise and accurate knowledge of the United States”. It contains about 20,000 American books, and over 100 American periodicals are found in the reading room. The books of the library are made available to university professors all over Italy, free of expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is in London an American law library, presented to the Middle Temple Library by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It contains 2,000 important books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to serving Americans abroad these American libraries are designed to create a better understanding of America and her people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Word About Special Libraries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With knowledge on every subject constantly increasing and the number of books written on these subjects likewise increasing, specialization has entered the field of libraries as it has that of industry. There are, first, the special business libraries which can be consulted by business men on the details of their particular lines of business. The value of these libraries is that they classify information and file reports and books in such a way that information will be available when wanted. Some business or industrial institutions maintain their own libraries; others consult libraries maintained by special societies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the growth of large corporations has made it impossible for one individual to know all about his own business, the special library is important. Several of these special business libraries contain over 25,000 books and other items and employ as many as thirty persons to classify, arrange and index the information and look after the library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One unique library contains American amateur papers, numbering 27,353. It is called the Library of the Fossils, and was organized in 1904 by 46 men who had been boy editors, publishers, printers and authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Saratov (Russia) on the Volga, has the world’s largest Esperanto library, containing 10,000 volumes. The universities of Wisconsin and Michigan have important labor libraries. Princeton University claims to have the largest labor library in the United States. The Frick Art Reference Library in New York contains thousands of photographs of paintings and drawings from the twelfth century to the present, and thousands of books, catalogues and magazines. Sir Robert Witt’s collection of similar material contains 250,000 photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Harvard University has a large collection of Hebrew literature, totaling more than 12,000 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An unusual library, now a part of the Augsburg Municipal Library, is one consisting of books on suicide and containing more than 4,000 units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A library begun with a scrapbook developed to proportions where it was worth thousands of dollars. It deals with the unofficial side of the war, sets forth public opinion and reaction in numerous countries as recorded in newspapers and periodicals. Dr. Joseph Broadman of New York made the collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the most comprehensive reference libraries on aeronautics and radio is found in the New York University School of Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is in New York a library, containing a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">huge collection of books, newspapers and magazine articles, photographs and other pictures and documents, all about one man, Theodore Roosevelt. It is called the Roosevelt Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A library of 1800 volumes, all about bees, is the possession of the British ministry of agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That much of the material stored in the world’s libraries is of little permanent value has already been suggested in this article. That the truths recorded in books on history and science are combined with falsehoods and guesswork is undoubtedly true. Further, works on philosophy but drive home the truth that “the world by wisdom knew not God”. Certain it is that all reading must be done with a vast amount of caution, an endeavor to take the precious from the vile and to fill the mind with truths rather than misleading fancies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The book, in reality a library in itself, which is unqualifiedly true and profitable, has already been mentioned. “Thy word is truth.” The Word of God records the progress of the people of God, nominal and true, both historically and prophetically, and shows their conflict with the hosts of evil under the control of Satan the archenemy of God, and the ultimate deliverance of humanity into the glorious liberty of the children of God. “Purified seven times,” the Bible supplies our need of a touchstone by which literature of all kinds may be tested and gauged, its worth determined, and its probable effect for good or ill estimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is now being brought into unusual prominence a series of books constituting in reality a library of Bible knowledge, linking the present with the prophetic Word and pointing to the early vindication of the name of Jehovah God, so generally ignored in the works of men, but whose glory and truth shall yet fill the earth. These books, though prepared by men, contain not the wisdom of men, nor do they record the opinions of men, but the unchangeable truths of the Lord Jehovah. In His providence they have found their way into millions of private libraries throughout the world, bringing blessing and comfort wherever the message they bear is received into good and honest hearts. The books are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Deliverance, Creation, Reconciliation, Life, Government, Prophecy, Light</span><span class="font6"> (two books), </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font6"> (three books), and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation.</span></p>
