<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>In Two Parts —</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Part 2</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">P</span><span class="font7">ELICAN NARROWS is about equally divided between two creeds, but the Catholics get at least 90 percent of the government rations. What little the Protestants get from “Father” Guilloux is always wrapped up in humiliation, taunting rebuke, or pleas to change their religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the Indians do change in the end, although the matter of provisions is not always the deciding factor, for the Protestant Indians often envy their Catholic cousins, as the latter have a high priest in constant attendance. The Anglicans also bring pressure to bear upon the Indians where they happen to have the upper hand, for government graft and a physical hell are the common tool of both creeds in the North.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>The Church Graft Structure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian Department has built many boarding schools throughout the Canadian West and the Northwest. These schools have cost great sums, and were built for the ostensible purpose of educating the Indians. But when the schools were turned over to the churches, the Indian’s hope for an education was completely crushed. The churches fill these schools with self-appointed tools of ignorance and bigotry, at a profit to the church and in the interest of perpetuating creeds at government expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the past the Indians were taught nothing but religion, while slight improvements have been noted lately, due to political unrest in a socially progressive West. But, on the whole, gross mismanagement continues unchallenged by a conscienceless government which is centered in the conservative and church-ridden East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian Department openly disregards the welfare of its charges, and political jobbery reaches its maximum stench in the Indian Department. The political support of churches is of far greater importance than the mere welfare of Indians, and thus the church graft structure is left undisturbed for the most part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Chief Long Lance, a Cree Indian writer who received his education at Carlisle, was the only Canadian who ever brought Indian school conditions before the public. He had to be content with a much censored press report on the Indian church schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He stated that the school inspectors themselves were less to blame than the political heelers who got the Indian agency appointments, while the political government always turned a deaf ear to criticisms, pleadings and exposures. School inspectors were provincial civil servants, responsible to the provincial rather than dominion government. These inspectors often turned in scathing indictments, while their reports were acknowledged, filed away, and conveniently forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Various financial arrangements and accommodations are in force between the Indian department and church organizations. Subsidizing missionaries in various localities under the pretense of calling them school-teachers is one form, while Mr. Settee and his Montreal Lake school will serve as an example of this type of graft. Elsewhere, as, for instance, Pelican Narrows, Stanley, Red Earth, etc., missionaries or student divines were subsidized during the summer months under pretext of conducting schools.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>“By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">In civilized communities it has been found necessary to train men and women specifically as school-teachers. Those who would teach the Indians should be qualified teachers in the first place, and should receive special training besides, for savages present problems peculiar to themselves, as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But instead of being qualified in any way as teachers, the missionaries and students selected by mission societies and endorsed by the Indian</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Department are usually unfit, both by temperament and by training, to function as instructors of any sort. They are trained to mutter a church rigmarole, and explore a single verse in the Bible to tiresome depths, usually succeeding in befuddling their hearers and confusing themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their responsibility, such as it is, happens to be mission work rather than teaching, and their jobs depend on how acceptable they chance to be as missionaries. As teachers they can be, and always are, miserable failures, but it doesn’t matter so long as they keep up the missionary end of things, even if the Indian Department does foot the bill for a camouflage teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the case of boarding schools, incompetence is carried to even worse extremes. The government usually pays the church $150 annually for each Indian “student”, besides supplying and equipping buildings, and providing for many extras as well. The school year is ten months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the Indians stay over during holidays, especially if they are old enough to work, and a few are sent back to their villages for the summer months. In some schools the Indians are not permitted to leave until their sixteenth or eighteenth birthday, depending on the contract.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>A Sinecure for Parasites</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">A hundred and fifty dollars each per year, besides many prerogatives that only a chartered accountant could unearth, so indirect are governments in this respect. The Indians do all the work, while “sisters” and “brothers” and “fathers”, etc., etc., etc., make their happy homes in the schools, which are resplendent with private quarters and fancy chapels, and these parasites lead the life of medieval lords, with plenty of native servants at either elbow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian children are kept in the schools until they are eighteen, as a rule, and the older “students” are worked shamefully hard, receive no pay except for a tobacco allowance for the boys, while I don't know just what the older girls get; maybe chewing gum. Snuff is the prime favorite with the boys, who chew and spit as they work. And the conscienceless church prelates collect $150 per annum for each of the hard-working older boarders, who really earn their board and much more besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To some people a hundred and fifty dollars may not seem like a large sum, but the Catholic church schools most certainly pay handsome dividends to the central organization, even though the schools do support large numbers of pious “sisters”, “brothers” and “fathers”, besides a “mother superior” or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the Indian students rustle for their keep, as I have seen the boys fishing in the dead of winter, thirty miles or more from the school, week after week, when they were supposed to be receiving an education. The “sisters”, “brothers,” “fathers” and etceteras do the supervising. The Indians do the work. The Indians cut the wood and haul it, milk the cows and grow the vegetables, clear the land and stump it, plough it, plant it and harvest it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Death Grip on the Public Teat</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic institutions do not pay wages to their “sisters”, “brothers,” “fathers” and “mothers”, and these individuals get their fun out of life as they know best, are well fed and clothed, with nothing to worry about, and plenty of servants to boss around. The Anglicans do pay wages, small as these wages are on the whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Cranberry Portage, Manitoba, for instance, a munificent government allows a relief ration of $15 a month for a family of eleven. The same government pays the missions that much a month for a single Indian child, besides providing shelter, and the equipment which makes it possible for the child to earn his own keep!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The $15 a month in Cranberry covers whatever the family of eleven care to buy in the way of groceries, while fuel, light, housing and other incidentals are the concern of destitute persons, although the government gives clothing to the children in certain blue-printed cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the light of comparison, the churches ought to be coining money, as the schools are almost always built just within the frontier, where fish and fuel, land and timber are handy, and the railroad is not too far away. Besides, prying eyes do not see too much in these isolated corners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Father” Guilloux, Breeder</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the Indians develop consumption, as they often do, the schools get rid of them in short order, sending them back north to spread the dread disease. A fourteen-year-old consumptive girl was sent back to Pelican Narrows. Her condition was such that the wonder was she lived, for the disease had affected her in the manner peculiar to certain stages of infection. That is, her physical actions were several moments behind her mental reactions. If her brain said, “Get out of the way!” she was a second or two late in getting going. If her brain said, “Stop!” she was a second or two behind again, bumping into people, or continuing in a way that often made her smile foolishly. Yet there is no telling how long an Indian will linger, for I have smiled as traveling doctors solemnly confided their findings to me, telling how this or that Indian had but thirty days to live, while some of these consumptives are still alive after seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other Indians were described as having one lung affected, and the doctor thought it would take a year or more to complete the fatal inroads of this terrible disease, and such Indians, in two specific cases, died within sixty days, although they showed few exterior symptoms of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet within three months of her arrival in Pelican Narrows, while yet under fifteen years of age, the priest, our friend “Father” Guilloux, married this “galloping” consumptive to an eighteen-year-old boy, against the wishes and the knowledge of the boy’s parents, who were away at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within a few months the girl was in a pregnant condition. I left Pelican Narrows about that time. I heard that she gave birth to a child and died, but do not know if the child lived.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>The Art of the Spawner</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Arthur Moran was discharged from the Cross Lake School with a tubercular gland at the approximate age of 16. After more than six years in the school, Arthur could not speak understandable English, and I had to beg him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Neehaathowan!” (“Speak Cree”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His writing was even worse, although he could draw his own name and I got so I could decipher the Cross Lake brand of penmanship and construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Through the efforts of Mr. Jan and myself, Arthur Moran was sent to a Prince Albert hospital, where the tubercular glands were treated. Arthur was in the hospital about twelve months, and came back once more, although he was not cured. But in those twelve months of association with white people, in an English-speaking nonsectarian hospital, Arthur learned to speak and write fluently, with nothing but his own ambition to urge him on!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Father” Guilloux hired Arthur Moran to take him north on a trip to South Reindeer Lake. The priest got the boy away from his relatives, and in a strange country, for the hoy had been absent so long that he knew no one in those parts. The priest set about finding Arthur a wife. He was going to mate the boy off as he would a canary. Arthur was girl shy, and came to me for advice. I told him there was only one thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Then tell me,” pleaded the boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Tell ‘Father’ Guilloux to go to h---,” I said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I will,” promised Arthur. So the priest was out of luck, for Arthur drew mental courage from my presence and continued advice. Then I went back to Pelican Narrows, expecting that Arthur and the priest would follow shortly.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Piling Burdens on Children</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of that, the priest went to Rabbit River. Here he found a fifteen-year-old girl whom Arthur had never seen nor heard of. Before Arthur Moran knew it he was a married man! The girl was Solomon Macauly’s daughter, and I doubt if she was fifteen, for I had seen her the summer before in short skirts, which is a pretty good indication of age in the north country and placed her under 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The marriage was an absurdity, and Arthur’s father and mother both cried, damned the priest, wouldn’t go to church for months, and wouldn’t receive the girl for two years, until the grandchildren began to arrive. Arthur Moran had the clothes on his back, but didn’t own his own dogs, a rifle, a trap or a canoe, nor was he trained to make a living in the North after spending six years in school cutting wood and grubbing gardens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Girls under twenty-one drag four, five and six children about wherever they go, and young fathers have such broods to support before they are twenty-three, and never have a chance, with a growing family like that, to lay anything ahead with which to buy rifles and canoes. These are merely concrete examples of a general condition. What’s the use of Canadians’ pretending to be shocked over child marriages in India when the same thing is forced on Canadian Indians by so-called “white people”?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>The Daughters of Magloire Benoni</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Magloire Benoni was a Chippewaian who trapped around Swan River on Reindeer lake. He was a good trapper and excellent provider. I stayed in Swan River on my way to Hatchet Lake one winter, waiting for a blizzard to blow out. Magloire’s wife kept a tidy house. They had two daughters, about 11 and 13, and a small son besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magloire was away, so I camped in his brother’s cabin, which was empty. The Indians are always suspicious about their womenfolk, and sometimes a trader must bear that in mind. But the Benoni woman sent her little girls over four times that day with a neatly covered silver tray which was loaded down with white bannock, cranberry sauce, boiled deer tongue, pounded deer meat with marrow fat dressing, delicious pemmican and properly steeped tea. The two little girls were clean, neatly dressed, well fed and healthy. They lived clean outdoor lives, had plenty to eat and warm clothing, and flourished on the happiness that kind parents bring to any child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the trail next day I met Magloire Benoni, who told me that he was sending his two daughters to the new Guy school in Sturgeon Landing. I showed the Indian where he was making the mistake of his life, telling him that he and his wife could take far better care of their children than would a mob of insolent church parasites. The girls could cook and sew, were learning the life that was meant for them, and had nothing to gain by going to school other than learning a great deal of church rigmarole, and a broken brand of English, of which they would be properly ashamed once they heard white people who </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">could</span><span class="font7"> speak the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I also told Magloire about my own experiences with church institutions as a child, and convinced him that Indian children would be treated much worse. Magloire thanked me for having saved his children from a terrible fate.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Feverishly Clutching for Revenue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">“Father” Egenolf, of Lac du Brochet, insisted that Magloire should send his two daughters to the school. Magloire was a councilor, and his example carried weight. The priest knew that unless he could persuade Magloire to send his own children, scarcely an Indian child would be sent out of Brochet, and the church would lose revenues thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The priest never convinced Magloire himself, who was ashamed to look me up on his way to Sturgeon Landing with the children, but Eggie worked on the woman until she was convinced that sending the two girls to the school was the one and only wav to keep the whole familv out of hell! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magloire’s example started the thing going, and the Brochet children brought thousands of dollars to the church, which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font7"> have its champagne, its gold, embroidered gowns and milliondollar palaces, no matter if poor people and ignorant persons are the grist which feeds the monstrous machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I made a trip to Sturgeon Landing the first part of December following the opening of Guy school. It was in 1927 or 1928. I took a box of candy along and visited the school by the back entrance. The children were playing outside and were poorly clad, wearing tennis shoes in winter, pea caps without fur bands, short cot-tonade jackets, and most of them had no mitts and wore summer-weight stockings. The mercury is sure to be below' zero almost any day in the winter, and often runs forty to fifty below<sup>7</sup>, even during November.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Children Fed from the Slop Cans</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Workmen were finishing inside at the time. These men were paid by the day and provided with board. But the poor, ignorant Quebec “sisters” knew nothing about hygiene and less about modern cooking, while most of the workmen were western white men, and civilized. They objected to the food, and at last more than half of them went across the river to a boarding house where they paid for their board, although they got no rebate for the meals w<sup>7</sup>hich they refused to eat in the school. Cooking for the workmen was just another little incidental graft, but the men objected to the kind of cooking -which only a half-civilized Quebec peasant will concoct when faced with the task of cooking anything besides cabbages and peas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These workmen told me that the leavings of those who did eat in the school, including the leavings of “mothers”, “sisters,” “fathers” and “brothers”, w<sup>7</sup>ere saved up in great galvanized slop cans. Then, every other day or so, these cans were put on the stove and -water was added to the slop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus, meat scraps, potatoes and gravy<sup>7</sup>, fish, dessert, bread crusts and whatever happened to be left over by individual diners, or in the kettles, were all mixed together and thickened -with flour. The Indian children were then fed this poisonous swill, and even relished it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Benoni’s Daughters Not Used to Slops</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Nine Indian children died before the new year, and among them were Magloire Benoni’s two daughters. I think there were about sixty children that first winter, as the school was not completed, and the full quota could not be accommodated. Perhaps some of the children died of pneumonia or other complications caused by exposure, because they were improperly clad, but the greater number, if not all of them, died of stomach hemorrhages. The awful slops were no doubt the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magloire Benoni's two little girls were accustomed to good care, warm clothing and decent food, which was why they did not last long among ignorant, selfish, incompetent and cruel church parasites. Many of the other children had been poorly fed at home in some respects, but they certainly were not fed slops. What they got at home was primary foods, such as fish, meat, berries and bannock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for clothing, the Indian children were often in rags at home, but always warmly clad, for the women managed somehow to make something out of rabbit skins, moose hides, blankets, and even canvas from the summer before. Many of the children had rags sewn on them, and never took them off until they wore off, sleeping with what clothing they did have. But the children were warmly clad, no matter how poor their parents.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Most Despicable of Crimes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">When one sets out to criticize a system, it is perhaps just as well to suggest an alternative. In the case of Indian schools, that is simple enough. The Indian Department is spending enormous sums of money, all of which not only is wasted, but does great harm. Subsidizing churches which make a profit out of the Indians at government expense, and at the expense of overworked children besides, is a crime of the most despicable sort; for children are helpless, and most Indians are children regardless of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian Department should make itself responsible for the training of its charges. The Indian Department should leave religious fanaticism to the churches, and would be fully justified in prohibiting missionaries from setting their besodden feet on Indian territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indians want their missions, and some of them want their children in the church schools. They believe that the church is paying out good money in their behalf. In any event, the church alone “can keep them out of hell”. Their belief is negative, for the Indians do not understand heaven. As one old pagan put the case for organized religion among the Indians:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If you join up they give you wings to flap around with, and a fiddle to scrape as well. If you don’t join up they set you on fire and take good care the fires don’t go out. And on top of that they laugh at my religion, which was good enough for my fathers, and protected my people until the white devils came along with their wings and fire pots.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Conscienceless Indian Department</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian Department, through political wirepullers, gave the Catholic church a select piece of land in every Indian reserve throughout the West, over the protests of pagan Indians and Protestant Indians as well. This was a political move to satisfy the Quebec Catholics. But the 1930 election chased the Liberals out of office, and the Indians were permitted to bring their case to court. The church lost, and was obliged to pay damages. Had the Liberals remained in power the case would never have reached the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For half the present expenditure the Indian Department could establish a part-time day school throughout the North, and pay a good salary to a well-trained, intelligent instructor. The Indian children could stay in their homes like the civilized white children of today, and the Department could assist the parents with food and clothing. Such schools could not remain open the year round, because the Indians would be away six months in the year making a living with traps and snares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vocational training, hygiene and other subjects would thus replace the insidious church rigmarole, the superstition of a fiery hell, the back-breaking work of gleaning dividends for the church, and many of the present-day abuses. One good instructor holding school sessions five months in the year will accomplish infinitely more than a mob of “mothers”, “sisters,” “fathers,” “brothers,” “deacons,” “Reverends,” matrons, spinsters and choir girls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The younger generation should be taught fur propagation and other Northern pursuits. It is plainly ridiculous that men should chase over a hundred miles of country for the elusive fox, mink, beaver or rat, when he could raise the furbearing animals in a very small space with much less effort and better results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the Indian Department of Canada is the embodiment of criminal neglect, conscienceless exploitation, and studied incompetence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Sturgeon Landing school is no worse than any of the others, and better than most. A seventy-year-old deaf (and most assuredly dumb) antique medico was sent up from The Pas to whitewash the clergy. This old fossil reported that the nine children died of new plaster. He didn’t specify whether the children ate the plaster, but the plaster was to blame in any event. But the menu was changed from slops to fish, as dead children pay no dividends. There was an improvement in clothing issued as well, so the martyred children accomplished something for those who followed. It was ever thus.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Avoidance Is Sometimes Kindness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">I made the usual trip to Brochet for Easter. Magloire Benoni wanted to see me, but I avoided him with studied deliberation, and had Indians watching for me. Magloire was crazy with grief, and hadn’t set a trap or done a thing since he heard that his children were dead. Getting my story would only add fuel to the flames, and would end up in an insane demonstration of great violence. Even if I were to keep quiet, and pretend that I knew nothing whatever about the matter, I knew that the very sight of me would recall my warning advice given the winter before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I never avoided a man so much in all my life, and even went to the extreme of waiting outside in the bush while Indians persuaded Magloire that I was nowhere around. I had a positive premonition that something would click in the Indian father’s brain if he ever caught sight of me. Just one look, and he would go back with a definite plan of action: burn the church, shoot the priest, or do something like that; or even kill his heartbroken and bedridden wife for having given him no peace until he had consented to place the children in school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For that matter, “Father” Egenolf himself appeared heartbroken over the death of Mag-loire’s two children, and made a trip to Sturgeon Landing, where, I understand, he told the responsible persons plenty. But a priest is a priest first, and a human creature afterwards if such a thing is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Father” Egenolf was a German, a bit of a tyrant, erratic, and kind-hearted whenever he found it possible to shake church fanaticism for the moment. Most of the Catholic church parasites among the Indians were German, Belgian or French. In other words, the Indian Department put foreigners in charge of native Canadians.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Perfect System of Mental Cruelty</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian children begin their schooling a self-reliant, independent and even willful lot. They go back broken, self-conscious and browbeaten. The Catholic priests treat their young Indian charges with open contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They make the Indians feel the racial differences to begin with, but go much further than that. The priests elevate themselves to arrogant heights and assume the attitude of a perfect snob who is forced to pick up his skirts as he moves through a pack of mangy dogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the Indians are thick-skinned and get through school without hating themselves, assuming a grinning attitude of self-abasement for the sake of such favors as 'freedom from a fiery hell’. But many of the Indians are embittered with the cruel treatment they receive, and all of them become slaves, willingly or otherwise, for the Catholic priests have learned how to mold young minds to their vicious liking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic priests resort less to physical punishment than most people would believe, for their system of mental cruelty, superstitious frightfulness and downright deviltry suits the Indian temperament and does not leave physical marks. This system has been perfected from the Dark Ages down to the present time, and the tutored fears of these helpless children simplify discipline to a marvelous degree. One bark from the priest, and the rabbits run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic church in Canada, among certain foreign elements and rural Quebec, resembles Mexico and Spain of two decades ago. But among the helpless Indians, with the aid of Government subsidies, the reign of terror has reached its zenith.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Taxpayers Dreadfully Wronged</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian Department will always admit that Catholic Institutions give them less trouble than similar Protestant schools among the Indians. Certainly, and if someone would kill the Indians off and be done with it, then the Indian Department would have even fewer responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Anglicans teach hell-fire and brimstone to the Indians, of course, but have not as yet developed a perfect system or method. The Anglican hell is quite hot, but less convincing. The chief trouble with Anglican schools is that of incompetence, and discipline is therefore sadly remiss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indians do not fear the reverends and matrons and spinsters and choir girls who do the supervising in Protestant schools, nor do they love them, for that matter. Physical punishment is much oi'tener the rule in Protestant schools, and reflects the insufficiency of those in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After watching the picked weaklings and incompetents of our own white race, the graduates of Protestant Indian church schools often go home with the idea that white people are a contemptible lot. But the white people must be tolerated, for they issue the government rations, write tickets on heaven, and underwrite exemptions from hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indians all believe that the church is paying the bill for their schools, and the Indians therefore wrongly place this item on the credit side of church accounts. This belief is one of many deliberate lies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>“Investigating” the Church Schools</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It was never the purpose of Catholic authorities to teach the Indians anything but the rigmarole of creed in their own language. The church succeeded admirably in keeping the Indians from learning anything about the outside world until about three years ago, when I sent a report to Ottawa, where it received but slight attention. Still, the Saskatchewan government was also supplied with a copy of my charges, and a few changes were made which might or might not have been the result of my complaint. My charges were leveled against the Indian Department and the Catholic church jointly, with the Anglicans coming in for criticism of a slightly different sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An employee of the Indian Department, and one of the very employees directly responsible for the vicious state of affairs, was sent around to investigate my charges. Copies of these charges were forwarded to all the clergymen in the district, months before the “investigation’’ was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Trading company head offices were also notified, for the word went around that traders would find it advisable to keep strictly out of the controversy. The natural result was a predetermined whitewash, as nothing else could be expected when a Department “investigates’’ itself without the help of complainants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was never interviewed, although I was available, and the “investigator” passed through Cranberry Portage. I didn’t know it at the time, but he knew where I was to be found. I do not know at first hand just how the “investigation” was conducted, but can at least repeat what the Indians and white men told me about it later. I have seen enough crimes committed against the Indians without borrowing accounts from others, but in this case I was in a position to verify reports personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the first place, my charges were deliberately garbled through the interpreter, as I kept copies of my report, and interviewed the Indians as they came to Cranberry Portage afterward. For instance, one of my charges was that an old Indian, Angus Mirasty, was refused sick rations when he was most certainly entitled to same without question, while another Mirasty, a young man who had a credit balance of more than a hundred dollars on our books at the time, received sick rations for an ailing child, just because he had that credit balance, and donated rather freely to the church. In this case, my charge was deliberately reversed, and the old Indian indignantly denied the charge as it was interpreted.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Celibates Reflect Their Nasty Minds</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Another of my charges referred to the manner in which priests interfered with the family life of the Indians, such as arbitrarily ordering women to travel in pairs, to remain inside after dark, and like medieval prescriptions of an unnecessary and absurd description, considering the Indian temperament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">White men send their wives with the Indians, by dog train or by canoe, unaccompanied, and unafraid of irregularities or atrocities, although often such trips require days and weeks, with camps in the open, or at best under a tent. The priests merely reflected their own nasty minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The priests forbade Indian women to enter a trader’s house to do the wash, or scrub the floors, unless properly guarded by another woman and a child besides, while some traders were not to be trusted at all, and such traders would have to get Protestant women to do their work, or do it themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I took that sort of rot as a personal insult, even though I considered the manner of men who promulgated such childish nonsense. I made it my business to refuse work to any woman who would not defy the priest, and do her work without a police guard. I fired the first woman who told me what a martyr she was making of herself, and the priest at last got tired of demanding a police force when the women did scrubbing for me unaccompanied.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Ruffling the Skirt Department</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">There is a humorous side to everything, and I got quite a kick out of ruffling the clergy. I bribed a woman to shorten her skirts until they reached the obscene height of her ankles. “Father” Guilloux denounced this woman publicly in church, but the habit spread, until all the younger women took to wearing their skirts ankle length, instead of dragging them in the dirt. I sold a few less yards of print, but otherwise got cpiite a kick out of the reformations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bobbing hair was particularly taboo. I left Pelican Narrows before I had time to break down this and similar taboos. We got in a supply of V-neck blouses, but got them back from the Indian because the priest would not stand for them. But in this case there was a commercial incentive, and the priest eventually capitulated.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Beskirted Order of Ananias</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">After the “investigation” I saw friends, and these told me that they got so sick of listening to the abuse heaped upon me by the clergymen throughout the North, and in particular by the ‘Investigating Committee of One’ from the Indian Department, that they defended me openly, although it was their place to keep quiet for their own good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of these friends asked the “investigator” to keep quiet if he could do nothing but criticize me for telling the evident truth, as this friend had known me, and been in the country, long enough to know the truth. Another friend suggested that I be permitted to confront my accusers, and offered to bet that I would prove the truth of every statement made by myself, and prove the statements of priests and others to be deliberate falsehoods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Priests are natural liars. They do it for the church, of course, until at length they get into the habit of lying unnecessarily. The white people up north, as apart from the priests, used to visit the padres who would tell each visitor wonderful gossip about his neighbor. Then we would throw a party and compare notes, while the priests furnished all the laughs. Often we started rumors ourselves for the sake of getting them back with all the fancy absurdities such as only a bushed priest can think up.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Converts Rotten with Venereal Disease</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">During the 1929 Saskatchewan election church graft was made an issue, while certain exposures helped to elect a Conservative government. Separate schools in which French was the predominant language, against the laws of the province, and similar abuses in force in some French Canadian settlements, for the sake of votes, were given a public airing, while the Anderson forces were pledged to clean house on these issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quebec French-language newspapers and periodicals ran a long-distance barrage of embittered editorials and abusive cartoons, until it almost seemed likely that Quebec would send an army into Saskatchewan territory!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At He a la Crosse, three hundred miles north of Big River, the nearest railroad point, the situation was particularly bad. That section of the country was completely overrun with priests, missions, schools, and the like. Besides, there was a French element among the Indians, which made it easier for the French-speaking Canadian and Belgian priests to gain complete control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hardly an Indian or a breed could be found that wasn’t rotten with venereal disease, while darkest ignorance was the eternal burden of these backward, church-ridden peoples. “Fathers” Egenolf, Guilloux, Desmereaux and others in the Pelican Narrows district were plaster saints compared with the He a la Crosse monsters.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Another Source of Graft</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Government was at last forced to send a doctor up to He a la Crosse, where a hospital was erected; and, of course, this hospital came under the control of church prelates, as it afforded another source of graft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just how far the provincial government went in rectifying He a la Crosse conditions, I do not know, but Premier Anderson’s government did insist upon employing a first certificate schoolteacher in each of the Indian boarding schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such schools are the responsibility of the Indian Department, but the provinces share certain responsibilities in the matter of education and inspection, if and when a provincial government can be found that will implement such responsibilities for the protection of the Indians within its borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catholic authorities, in particular, are greatly perturbed over this changed state of affairs, and will certainly take the stump against the Anderson regime during the next election. In Pelican Narrows we had sworn affidavits at one time attesting to the statements made by a certain priest that half-breeds and Indians who had a vote would be excommunicated if they did not vote the church ticket.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Children Taught Nothing in Eight Years</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Indian children in Guy school, Sturgeon Landing, are actually learning to read and write English; thanks to a licensed teacher. Hitherto the church parasites had maintained that Indians were naturally dumb, and their children could not absorb an education, except the complicated church and choir rigmarole of every “holy” day in the calendar, and the much more complicated syllabic script, the Cree alphabet with which church propaganda is written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Clergymen are proven liars, and the Indian children have proved them liars again, for the first certificate school-teacher in Guy school has done more in one year than Cross Lake school in Manitoba did up to the time it was burned to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indians used to come back from Cross Lake school, after an attendance of six to eight years duration, and nobody could understand their peculiar brand of disconnected bastard English. It was the sort of jargon which ignorant nuns of French rural Quebec origin might speak, if they happened to be bright enough to get even that far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for reading and writing, the Cross Lake “students” knew syllabic script forward and back, but few of them could stumble through the first reader, or write a readable letter. There were a few exceptions, where certain ones were determined to learn, and stayed around Cross Lake oi- The Pas for a year or so after they were discharged, mingling with white people and English-speaking breeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few of the returned “students” picked up some English from traders and the like, while many of them forgot the atrocious jargon and reverted to bush language, ashamed of the incorrect and ridiculous version of Cross Lake cross-breeds in vocabularies and hieroglyphics.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Clergy Ruin Everything Not Fool-Proof</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Anglican schools were somewhat better in regard to teaching the English language at least; for the Anglican missionaries, matrons, choir girls and spinsters did speak the English language, and seldom went to the trouble of learning Cree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As for the school-teachers employed in the Anglican missions, these individuals could never be classed as teachers in any sense of the word, and were usually spinsters and choir girls with religious inclinations, but entirely without the necessary training, temperament or talent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The missionaries and “reverends” in charge were even worse than the “teachers” and matrons under them; for clergymen do not display the practical general knowledge so essential to ninning institutions of any sort. The impractical clergymen ruined anything breakable, such as lighting and pumping plants, heating systems, and the like; for they seldom possessed executive ability, and therefore fell short of hiring men who knew their business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Rev.” Hives, of Lac la Rouge, who was in charge of the school some years ago, did pretty good work as a school superintendent so far as the system permitted. He worked with what material there was to be had, and made the best of it. Curiously enough, I have heard him constantly criticized because it was thought he might have been more zealous as a minister. I never knew it to fail: when someone within the church organizations develops a little horse sense everybody knifes him in the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the Anglicans are not guilty of a deliberately planned system of mental cruelty such as the Catholic hierarchy has perfected. The Anglicans betray a natural race prejudice, an attitude which sometimes becomes extravagant, particularly in the case of Englishmen who can be very aloof and snobbish in their relations with natives in any land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But such an attitude never approaches the pernicious practices of Catholic priests, who cause the Indian children to cringe, to feel their status keenly, to fear the power of priests, to beg small mercies sneeringly granted, and to grovel in the “omnipotent presence” of all the prelates, small fry and swordfish, dolphins and sharks, or whatever one might wish to call the various church parasites.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Indians Resent Cruel Treatment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Cross Lake school, in Manitoba, was burned to the ground four years ago with the loss of nine lives. No public investigations were instituted, although the police tracked down a former inmate and brought him to trial on a charge of arson, two years after the alleged crime was committed. The young Indian was convicted, and will spend the rest of his years in the penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indians who knew’ the young man as a school boy tell me that he was of an independent sort, and was cruelly punished again and again. The youth had been an unwilling prisoner in the school, and, like many others, tried again and again to run away from the terrible place. The priests, then as now’, turned the mounties loose on the poor kids, and back went the hopeful runaways to prison. Perhaps the young man is guilty, although I doubt it. That nine Indians should perish for the sake of obliterating an infamous institution is regrettable, but, at least, the wretched thing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font7"> obliterated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">La Plonge Indian school, in the He a la Crosse district, was burned to the ground three years ago, and twenty-nine children were burned to death, together with a nun. No investigations were held, and the “martyred<sup>-</sup>’ nun was loudly applauded for her devotion. ‘She had died while attempting to save her young charges,’ said the frenzied pro-Catholic accounts. She was an inspiration to good Catholics who read about it, and young girls with hearts broken by imagined first love were urged to imitate the devotion of this departed nun and take up the veil in her stead! Then there were the twenty-nine helpless Indian children. But w’hat’s an Indian, more or less, or a dozen or two, for that matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About three months ago another Indian church school was burned to the ground for the second time. Then, two weeks ago the Machay school, near The Pas, Manitoba, burned to the ground, also, with “Rev.” Fraser in charge. But— hush! The sacrosanct clergy were in charge of all these institutions, and nothing must be said or done about it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Arson, Carelessness, or Both?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty-nine Indian children charred in a heap at La Plonge. I'gly stories about that fire circulate among the Indians whose children came out alive. They tell of a fanatical nun who bolted the door and prayed to “Mother Mary” for “deliverance”. And the children were “delivered”. Delivered from the cruel church institution; delivered from the wretched poverty which deliberately fostered ignorance breeds; delivered from the fear of an eternal fiery hell!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But a few months previous to the La Plonge fire nine children were burned to death in the Cross Lake school. Children facing the fiery demons in grim reality. Children that aw’oke from their dreams of hell to find flames enveloping them! Children who had lived hand in hand with Nature and loved her, walked with her and talked to her. Children whose minds were prostituted with the conscienceless lies of church prelates, who told of a “God<sup>-</sup>’ that would fry little children over an open fire in all eternity unless they obeyed the priests to the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Were the buildings fireproof? Were those in charge capable of taking ordinary precautions against fire? Were they equal to the trust reposed in them by sleeping children? Were reasonable efforts made to save defenseless inmates? or did the padres and the rest of their human paraphernalia run for their lives? Surely the loss of life, particularly in public institutions, called for a thorough investigation. But not in Canada. Not where the sacrosanct clergy are concerned. And there were the nine lives in Sturgeon Landing too, a death toll which w’as the product of ignorance and greed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Indians Beginning to Awaken</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Another church graft chapter is being written today. The Pelican Narrows Indians, and others in the district, have begun to wake up. I can accept a measure of responsibility for the small beginning. It is becoming more and more difficult for the padres to get “students”, for the murmur of overworked children against the fetters of open contempt is drifting through the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And so, in order to fill up the institutions and pay the maximum dividend thereby, the children of white men, provided such children have a portion of Indian blood in their veins, are now<sup>7 </sup>being taken into the Indian church schools, while the padres collect from an asinine Indian Department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, legislation means nothing in Canada. An “Order in Council<sup>-</sup>’ decrees that black is white, annuls the written statute, and writes temporary statutes. Orders in council are passed by the “Cabinet in Council”, and are legislative enactments which defeat the wishes of Parliament in the most deliberate manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Parliament upholds this travesty on its rights, because in Canada the defeat of an order in council, when referred to Parliament for sanction, would lose members of Parliament their jobs and precipitate another election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That orders in council are subject to sanction by Parliament is a meaningless pretense. No doubt a covering order supports the Indian Department and the church, and such an order arbitrarily permits white to be called black.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But it must be a bitter disappointment to “Bishop” Charlebois (we call him “Charlie Boy”) when he thinks about those first certificate school-teachers in Saskatchewan, for these teachers must produce results or surrender their certificates. The Indians are actually learning to read and write at an early age. They will be reading newspapers and magazines, and— horrors! what if they should read Judge Rutherford ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Northern Missions Once Profit-bearing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a time when northern missions paid for themselves, even without government graft. But those days are over; for the Indians have become impoverished with disease, scarcity of fur, and a changed living condition. There was the time when Indians moved from place to place and allowed first one section and then the other to recuperate, piece by bit, and thus the country was not killed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the Indians cluster around their churches, and refuse to budge when the country is trapped out, fished out, and shot out, while the white trappers go farther afield, away from the churches, and trap out the sections which once nourished the Indians, and might have fed the church territory with its overflow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must never be forgotten, when dealing with the Indian question, that traders believe in the missions for selfish reasons. The Indians stay put where the church rears a spire “heavenward”, and thus the traders can estimate their business accordingly, and need not fear the loss of buildings caused by nomad Indians’ moving out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Estimating merchandise requirements in the North is no easy task at any time; for a whole years’ requirements are ordered at one time, and if the trader orders too much he is saddled with idle capital, while if he orders too little it sometimes takes months before the shortage can be replaced. The church is a stabilizing influence ; for the worshipers are the trader’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“God Save le Pope”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The padre in charge of Guy school in Sturgeon Landing is Napoleon Dorion. And he is a little corporal, all right. A party of Saskatchewan officials landed in Sturgeon Landing by ’plane, while the nuns lined up the Indian children and ordered them to sing “God Save le Pope!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“God Save the King” is Canada’s colonial anthem, and the music, besides a parody on the British declaration of patriotism, was stolen in honor of the pope. The ignorant nuns did not realize that it might be considered bad taste to belittle King George in the presence of politicians, or perhaps they wanted to annoy the Saskatchewan officials. The first certificate school-teacher arrived shortly thereafter, and the “le pope” incident might have furnished the deciding impetus to a very necessary reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Pukkatawagan is “Father” Desmereaux, who gleefully advertises the fact that no Indian girl over fifteen stays single over the week-end, unless she happens to be attending school. It wouldn’t do to marry off a paying boarder just yet. He also counts the increase by these child marriages, as a farmer counts his pigs. This “Father” Desmereaux is another teapot despot, ruling out dances, ankle-length skirts and bobbed hair, besides interfering with family life generally.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Open, Deliberate Robbery of Indians</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">During the mining boom of a few years ago, traveling engineers had to see “Father” Desmereaux about Indian finds. Options were drawn up, not with the Indians, nor with the Indians named as the beneficiaries, but with some Catholic institution receiving the benefit. The Indians were to get their reward in heaven by special proclamation, and the Indian donor would be honored in heaven according to the financial success of the mine discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The church thus found itself in possession of mining claims, even though the mining ventures did not all pan out a profit, as certain fees had to be paid whether the property produced or not. “Bishop” Charlie Boy received a special dispensation from a willing government which exempted his church from financial burdens in connection with the stolen mining ventures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prospectors found this out and demanded similar treatment. That’s the trouble with the West. Not everybody is Catholic or Anglican, as in Quebec, and the vigorous complaint of “unholy” prospectors fixed Charlie Boy, who had to pay up or shut up in the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Father” Guilloux, of Pelican Narrows, also had his hand, both hands, outstretched for the fruits of Indian prospecting. But he stretched and pleaded in vain, for the Indians had myself and one or two others to reason with them. Make an Indian seem foolish in his own eyes and he forgets hell long enough to use his head.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Conspiracies to Keep Masses in Chains</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">When the province of Alberta tried to get her natural resources, six years ago, the Liberal government attached a rider to the bill which provided for separate church schools, to be maintained by the provincial government. The Alberta legislature indignantly turned down the measure, and the transfer was thereby delayed two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Church grafts are many, even outside the Indian country, and even more horrible. The Catholics get most of their graft from the Liberal party, while the Conservatives hand out favors to the Anglicans, although both Big Business parties grant special favors to church organizations in general, as part of a conspiracy to keep the masses in chains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Canada’s prisons are cluttered with well-paid padres and chaplains, while prisoners are forced to attend these hypocritical conclaves or be severely punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Headingly jail, in Manitoba, for instance, three men were found in the black hole, an incident which a newspaper man uncovered. If the press would print more facts about the guilty acts of criminal officials and sacrosanct individuals the press could be of service to the public, instead of riding the public down with propaganda and piffle, the latter being all about the indiscretions of press-agented movie morons and other rot. One of the prisoners found in the black hole was there because he refused to attend a hypocritical church service.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Paganism Masquerading as Christianity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The evil fruits of mission domination are the destruction and degradation of a once proud race. The pagan rites of the Indians were taken away from them, as part of a “civilizing” process. A mounty went to Lac du Brochet on an inspection trip, and chanced to see “Bishop” Charlie Boy arrive in the Indian village. Canopies and carpets awaited the bishop. Indians kneeled and bowed their heads! A marching procession kissed the bishop’s ring. Children and women cringed! Once independent Indian bucks bowed, dropped to their knees, hung theii’ heads, and acted as though they missed a tail to stick between their legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mounty spoke out, loud enough for the cunning bishop, the fussy padres, and others to hear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I have orders to discourage paganism whenever I come across it. This is paganism as I have never hoped to see it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several New York sportsmen happened to be traveling through the country, and one of these was a devout Catholic. He told me:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I can never look a priest in the face again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mounty returned to headquarters, and his chevrons were taken from him without any preliminaries whatever. “Bishop” Charlie Boy saw to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pagan rites of Indians looked foolish to white people, but many of these childish manifestations had a wise meaning. Sanitation was provided for, and made interesting with ceremony. Morals were strictly provided for, and the ceremony was interesting to some, and painful to others. Health was also provided for by rites, as were hygiene and family relations. Much of the pagan creed was cruel, but most of it was necessary to the health and morals of the Indians.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Old Paganism Better than the New</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Paganism was suppressed by the police and by the missionaries. Instead of paganism, the fear of hell and the forgiveness of sin under certain guaranties were supplied the Indians. The pagan steam bath was declared obscene, but modern plumbing fixtures are not available in the North, especially among the Indians, and thus the natives never bathe, or take their rubdowns as in heathen days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Excesses were punished in the old days, and young people were warned and trained by the help of a pagan ceremony. Excesses today are allowed unchecked, for there is always the confession box, and the white men usually set the pace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Consider an Indian, married, the fathei<sup>1</sup> of children, and living on the outskirts of The Pas or any other frontier white man’s town. His woman makes the acquaintance of white men, and the husband discovers her indiscretions. He therefore whips her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most people consider wife-beating a heinous crime. Perhaps it is, but a savage race cannot be elevated overnight. Besides, there are no divorces among Indians. At any rate, an Indian woman will listen to a stern husband only when she knows that the command carries the warning of chastisement. They are still savages, these Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The whipping has the desired effect, and the woman shuns her white friends, until the latter discover the reason. Then the white men tell the woman that it is unlawful for a man to beat his wife, and promise to have the law’ on the husband and father if he attempts to beat her again.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Where the Police Come In</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Thus reassured, the Indian woman continues her indiscretions, and receives presents of money, goods and wine. Again the Indian husband and father beats his wife, and some days later is surprised to have a mounty haul him into court. The judge will usually not sentence the Indian for first offense. The Indian does not understand this interference with his family life, but does know that his own self-respect and the safety and integrity of his family depend on keeping his woman straight. So he beats her again, and this time he goes to jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After six months of confinement the Indian has had plenty of time to consider matters, and usually gives up trying to fathom the vagaries of justice. The white man’s law forbids wifebeatings. Very well, the Indian does not want another trip to jail, and will therefore stop beating his wife, and another milestone has been reached. The Indian has become “civilized”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Home once more, the Indian finds that his woman has made progress among her white friends, and she shows him the fruits of her new trade. It takes time for him to get used to things, but liquor helps him to forget his troubles. Uis wife becomes a prostitute in his own house. The children grow up in such an atmosphere, and the woman, being ignorant, keeps on bearing children, quite often sired by white men, rather than by her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And So, Civilization at Last</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No Indian woman lasts long as a prostitute. They age quickly, and do not look after themselves. Finally, the Indian couple, and even their children as they grow older, become infected with venereal diseases. Sometimes they are discovered and hauled into a hospital. More often they spread disease far and wide. But they are ■'civilized'’, because they go to church, and have learned that wife-beating is not civilized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, there are many laws on the statute books which are meant to protect the Indians. It is illegal to give intoxicating liquors to an Indian. There are even local regulations forbidding Indians off the reservation after dark, or prohibiting white men from trespassing on the reservations after dark. But a good many Indians do not live on reservations, and the rules and regulations cannot be enforced in any event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the Indians are “Christians”. They are “civilized” now; for, instead of singing their old songs and beating their tom-toms, they now listen to gramophones screech jazz music. Instead of beating their wives they prostitute their wives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And lest readers should think that wife-beating is a favored Indian institution, let me say that I have yet to find a pagan Indian who would beat his wife when sober. But wife-beating was the right of a husband, the pagan rites provided lesser punishment, and the threat of a beating was usually enough for the Indian women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, when the white men crowded in upon the pagans with their hell-fire, their pious denunciation of pagan rites, their liberalized standards for women, and their fire water, the pagan law often broke down, and the Indians usually surrendered to “civilization” in the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indians had a law which might not have been perfect. But the Indians were wise enough to make only such laws as could be enforced. White folks make laws for the idealistic sound of meaningless phrases, knowing full -well that such laws cannot be enforced. Imperfect Indian laws perfectly enforced have been replaced by idealistic laws which cannot be enforced, and the Indians are sinking with depravity and physical filth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>One of the Pole Cats</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the padres get properly bushed, and none of them ever set a very shining example of cleanliness. I know the priest whom “Father” Desmereaux relieved at Pukkatawagan, and who came out via Pelican Narrows, was even filthier than the deadliest Christianized Indian I ever saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This priest came to me for medicine, and when he was gone from the house I opened up all the doors and windows for the rest of the day, and stayed outside, the stench was so bad. The priest was indeed a sick man. But there was really nothing wrong with him excepting the indescribable, nauseating filth of the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is true that traders and others get bushed as well as the clergymen. But, at least, traders get moved around by their companies when the inspector sees the way things are going. Some traders are independent, and marry Indian women, live in the country and raise a brood of half-breeds. Some of these traders become thoroughly bushed, as do some of the trappers, but not all of them, by any means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a clergyman gets bushed, the effect is heightened by religious fanaticism. A clergyman’s responsibility is greater, for he holds the key to heaven and the charms which keep Indians out of hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No matter how absurd his actions become, such actions must not be questioned, and must be upheld by government and church alike. Such is the insanity of Northern conditions, for most priests actually do become bushed, or mildly insane, in the North, but are nevertheless entrusted with grave responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">All the Missionary Cares About</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All that a missionary cares about is converts to his creed. Government graft is based upon the number of converts made. The clergy are quick to close up a church if it does not pay for itself, indirectly or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Indians would be free of church despotism if the government would quit subsidizing the clergy. The Indians would have been much better off had they never seen a missionary; for the fakes have given the Indians “hell” in exchange for a native ritual which provided for health, hygiene, entertainment and morals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One Anglican admitted, much to his own surprise, no doubt, that the Indians should first be taught cleanliness. A pagan Indian is always clean, even if he wipes dirt off instead of washing it off, or rubs dirt off after a steam bath instead of rinsing it off in a bath tub. But the missionary’s wife wrinkled her nose at the idea of washing Indian brats behind the ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indian missions are a curse. The despicable Catholic priests, recruited in Belgium and darkest Quebec, speaking French and scorning the English language, although the West does not accept the Dominion system of French-English bilingualism, spit on the Indians with the venom of festering parasites. The Indians run around like yellow dogs, almost pleased if a white man notices them long enough to administer a swift kick. And the Indian Department pays for this sort of inferiority complex.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>“Business Is Business”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Subsidize the missions, 0 Canada, and vilify your Indians. The Indian Department and the church will seek to cover up the truth. The Indian Department, because it consists of political heelers and spineless incompetents, who are paid to keep their mouths shut, will investigate itself and justify itself. The church, of course, is beyond criticism! The traders, no matter how well they know actual conditions, will say nothing, or will even support the present system if pressed for an answer. Business is business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the Indians, by this time fully convinced that hell is a seething inferno and a most uncomfortable destination, will support their padres and church spires with fanatical fervor. And the march of ignorance and misery quickens with the years, until, perhaps, the North country will develop a fitting scourge which will spread like wildfire and punish those white people who say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We are not the Indian’s keeper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let no man think that I have singled out extravagant examples, or singled out particularly guilty clergymen. I have drawn but a fraction of a horrible picture; for much of it is unspeakable, and I have not covered the whole country by personal observation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Absurd as matters appear in the light of personal experience, I know that I have seen only a small part of the whole structure. But all of the foregoing should provide a keyhole through which people may look, and in their hearts wonder :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After all, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> a clergyman such a sacrosanct article? Or is he not a little worse than the average ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Morgan Tax Evasions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">CTVIE ARBITRATOR</span><span class="font7"> says succinctly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The tax evasions by the Morgan partners were exasperating, especially as several members of the firm found their wives useful forthat purpose. Thomas S. Lamont sold securities to his wife at a loss of $114,-A07 to avoid a tax of $20,305 ; Harold Stanley sold to his wife for the same reason; William Ewing’s wife made him trustee of four trusts for his children and lent him shares of stock so that he could speculate for those trusts and not report the profits made, which evasion was approved by the L’nited States Board of Tax Appeals. All that was necessary to effect a sale was to have the husband's account credited on the books of J. P. Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Company and the wife’s account debited. The firm dissolved their partnership and took in a new partner so as to revalue their securities and evade income taxes by establishing a loss of $21,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Picnics and Poisons </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Ida K. Herron (Canada)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font7">WAS on a lovely bright day in the month of July of 1932 that our Community Club had a picnic. The day was tine, the children happy, and parents who were no longer young were all gathered together to try to forget their worries and enjoy the day with their young folks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everything went fine, the program was carried out to the letter, the prizes for swimming, races and tug o’ war were all given out and the long plank tables under the trees were loaded with good things (some not so good) which everybody seemed to enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Large kettles of salad were in great evidence and looked very appetizing. They were in every form of dish, from the small earthen bowl to the large aluminum kettle, which was set in the center of the long table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The picnic was pronounced a huge success, and a yearly event of the same nature suggested. The news sent to the local paper was mailed before anything happened. But did anyone get a full night’s rest that night? No indeed. About three a.m. one after another of the children and many adults awoke violently ill. Vomiting and bowel trouble were a common complaint for from three to live days. Many could not understand the cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About four families at the picnic avoided all foods in aluminum dishes, or that may have been prepared in them, and not one in any of those families felt any bad effects from the day’s outing or the food. And as many as we could find out had taken salad out of the aluminum dishes were ill.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font7"> WORLD in misery pleads in vain for a leader who can save it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now as always, being unable to think except in established grooves, it refuses even to consider the one leadership that would solve its problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All experience has shown that there is no hope for mankind except in Jesus of Nazareth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wisest men of many races, honestly striving to their utmost capacity, have devised scheme after scheme to insure peace, prosperity and security; yet each plan in turn, following some initial or apparent success, has broken down under the strain of greed, prejudice and malice. Even Communism, hope of the downtrodden masses, has in practice given power and privilege to the favored few while the toiling many live on crusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only one plan known to mankind remains untried. It is the way offered by the Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is not that fact alone sufficient reason to give it an honest trial? When desperate men adrift at sea have tried every known method to save themselves, without sign or promise of success, will they refuse to try a new method merely because it never has been used?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You will answer that the way of the Nazarene is impractical. That is true. Love and compassion are always impractical. So are songs, laugh-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">ter, poetry, music and all things that have no quality more useful than beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the impractical becomes the practical when men learn to use it. Nothing on earth is truly impractical when man develops sufficient knowledge and wisdom to comprehend and utilize it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are but two methods of controlling and directing a civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whatever the name of the method, and regardless of its confusing details, it is Christ’s way or it is the jungle way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The jungle way—the only one yet tried—is dog eat dog. Let the strong devour the weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite all good intentions and safeguards and restrictions, the jungle plan of competition must result in abundance for the few and misery for the many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why cling to a plan that inevitably dooms the many to want in a world of plenty? The strong alone enjoy it—and they only because they are praised and glorified by the weal; who provide their abundance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ’s way is the way of brotherhood—not of competition—the way of pity and love and generosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What fault has it ? If a man is weaker than you, is it not more decent and more enjoyable to help him than to show your strength by trampling him underfoot?</span></p>

The skin has a most important function to perform, and when it is burned it cannot do its work, which is thus transferred to the kidneys. The best time to sun-bathe is before the sun reaches the meridian. Do not expose yourself more than an hour at a time. Keep your eyes shaded; and keep turning, so as to avoid burning. Ten minutes in one position is ample.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font7">T IS well known, by those who have investigated the matter, that nobody knows what is contained in the material used for vaccination. The statement that pus is pure pus means just nothing at all, as is proved by the numerous complications that have arisen after vaccination. A German professor has been vaccinating large numbers of persons with a pus formed in the center of fertile new-laid eggs, instead of that scraped from a sore on the belly of a diseased calf. That is a good joke on the people who supposed they were being vaccinated with cowpox.</span></p>

If we wish revival without an early relapse into chaos, I do not think we shall go far with the advocates of the planned economy. They cannot make a comprehensive plan. The ablest and best-trained brains, given unlimited power, could not do it. The ablest students of economic theory can, only for a little while, at times when theii’ energies run high, see in theoretic outline, in schematic outline, an abstract picture of the economic order. But to make this abstract skeleton a thing adequate for conscious control of industrial life is an impossibility.”</span></p>

The remainder, 1,805 people, contributed exactly $158.00 to the collection. This is an average of about </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EIGHT AND ONE-THIRD CENTS (8^0) EACH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet most of these people came to this church in an automobile; some of them came in taxicabs; all of them were stunningly dressed; most of the men were smoking expensive cigars or cigarettes; vast numbers of them purchased the Sunday morning paper. They paid more for their newspaper or their cigars than they contributed to God; they gave a dozen times more to the taxicab than to the upkeep of the finest parish church in the world. They paid more for gasoline and oil and tires and their machines in one day than they gave to religion in a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pastor of this parish does not lack the capacity to pile up an elaborate array of adjectives to adequately characterize what he and other sensible people think of this intolerable shame and disgrace.

<p><span class="font6">You all know who is contributing and who is not. Why do you not indicate your displeasure and your resentment to them face to face on Sunday when you actually see them piously cheating God every Sunday and making religion ridiculous at the 10: 15 Mass, by dropping in the collection basket anything less than a dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In no sense does this apply to people who are out of work, or to children, or to those who for a valid reason are now in distress and who are contributing the maximum that they can afford. This church does not seek any contribution at all from poor people. It is our proud privilege to give to them instead of taking from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our cry of “Shame” is directed exclusively to the well-dressed and prosperous wage earners male and female, young and old, who are gainfully employed and who are squandering every week in luxuries and pleasures untold sums of money and are not contributing a dollar a Sunday to the collection. We know the names and addresses of many of these people; we know the license numbers of their cars; we know the huge sums they are expending for expensive boarding schools for their sons and daughters; we know the bills they run up at clubs for gay parties, we know what they pay for hats and fur coats, but we look in vain for their name in our list of contributors of a dollar a Sunday to the upkeep of religion.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH gives life to His creatures. He is the great fountain of life and blessing. All creatures that have life were given life, either directly or indirectly, by the great Creator. For this life all living and intelligent creatures should be very grateful. While gratitude should prompt all to loving devotion to Jehovah, yet many creatures have been so corrupted as to be a reproach to the Life-giver. Even in this extreme condition of unthankfulness to the Creator, the great Benefactor in His loving-kindness has made provision for the corrupt creatures, except those willingly and persistently bent on doing evil, to be cleaned up, to come into harmony with Him and be an everlasting praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has made it possible for all those who are in the way of life to do something on their part to manifest an appreciation to their Maker, and thus in turn they receive of His blessings. The one requirement necessary for any creature to continue in life is that he must be obedient to the will of God. When Jehovah placed man upon the earth He placed the test of obedience upon him. He informed Adam, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” (Genesis 2:16, 17) The divine Record has it that Adam disobeyed God and ate of the fruit, and that subsequently the penalty of death was passed upon Adam.—Genesis 3:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since Adam did not beget children until after the sentence of sin was upon him, it follows that Adam in the dying condition could not transmit perfect vitality upon his children, and hence all his children were born into the world imperfect and already on the pathway that leads to the grave. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12) It therefore became apparent that there was no hope for the human family except that Jehovah would make provision for the deliverance of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we examine the Word of God we find clearly stated that the Creator promises to rescue the race from sin and death and from all power of the Devil who originally led man into sin. How will the deliverance be made possible? What are the requirements of Jehovah? When will it be done ? These are questions of vital im-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">portance, and the death of Jesus is directly related to the proper answer to each of them. Deliverance could not take place until after redemption. Otherwise stated, the rights of man must first be purchased and then mankind may be delivered. Therefore this is the proper place to examine the question of redemption, and in the examination will appear the reason why the perfect man Jesus must die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adam was a perfect man when in Eden. Because of sin he was sentenced to death. God’s announced law required that the violator thereof should die. Justice therefore required the enforcement of the law, which meant the death of Adam. When the judgment of an earthly court of final jurisdiction is entered there is no power that can reverse that judgment. With stronger reasoning can that rule be applied to Jehovah's court. When He sentenced Adam to death that judgment was final and must be enforced. God could not consistently reverse His own judgment. God cannot be inconsistent. Therefore it was impossible for the judgment against Adam to be set aside or reversed. It is entirely consistent, however, that a final judgment entered in the case may be satisfied by a substitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To illustrate: Suppose Jones has a judgment against Smith for one thousand dollars, which has been confirmed by the court of last resort. This judgment has been entered in a jurisdiction where imprisonment can be had for failure to pay debt. The debtor is incarcerated in prison because of his failure to pay. Smith has a father who loves his son, and he produces the thousand dollars and hands it over to the judgment creditor Jones, who accepts it in payment of his judgment. The law therefore requires that the judgment shall be satisfied and Smith released. This is a rule of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same rule with stronger effect operates in Jehovah’s court. God could consistently arrange for the satisfaction of the judgment against Adam by substitution. But this must be done in a legal manner, that is to say, in a manner in conformity to the divine law. What, then, did the law require? The answer is: ‘A life for a life.’ (Deuteronomy 19:21) A perfect man, Adam, had been sentenced to death. The law therefore required a perfect human life. The price for redemption, the satisfaction of the judgment by substitution looking to the release of Adam, must be a life exactly equal to that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">life which Adam lost by reason of the judgment. Otherwise stated, nothing short of a perfect human creature willing to go into death could meet the requirements of the divine law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the human race descended from Adam; therefore all were born in sin and shapen in iniquity. (Romans 5:12; Psalm 51: 5) It therefore follows that there lived on earth no human creature capable of fulfilling the divine requirement with reference to the satisfaction by substitution of the judgment against Adam. This must not be understood as meaning the satisfaction of justice. Justice was satisfied with Adam’s death; and that judgment, which means the legal determination, would hold Adam for ever in death unless some substitute is provided equal to Adam that could be given instead of Adam to satisfy the judgment and let Adam go free. The substitute must be the life of a perfect man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Could not an angel or a divine person be used to satisfy the judgment against Adam and release him from the death sentence? The answer is: No, because the law of God could receive nothing more and nothing less than the judgment required; otherwise God w’ould be inconsistent; and He cannot be inconsistent. Here again Satan has employed his cunning devices to blind men to the true philosophy of the great ransom sacrifice. He has induced his representatives on earth, who have paraded in the name of the Lord, to teach the people that Jesus Christ when He was on earth was divine, and not a mere man; and that He died as a divine person. Any reasonable mind can see that if God would require such, God would be unrighteous. This false reasoning has turned away many men from the Lord and from His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seeing then that the law required the life of a perfect human creature, and that all the offspring of Adam were and are imperfect, the race appears to be and was in a helpless condition. It is stated by God’s prophet thus: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.” (Psalm 49:7) Would Jehovah provide for redemption? The Word answers: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, 1 will be thy destruction.”—Hosea 13: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is the positive word of Jehovah that He would provide redemption for the human race. Of an absolute certainty this will be carried out: “1 have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”—Isaiah 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For this reason “the [Logos] was made flesh, and dwelt among us”. (John 1:14) Seeing that the Logos was on the spirit plane with His Father, how could He be made flesh? 'With God nothing is impossible. With the consent of the Logos the Father transferred His Son’s life from the spirit to the human plane. He was begotten in the womb of Mary, a virgin, by the power of the holy spirit, which means the invisible power of Jehovah. (Matthew 1:18) In due time He was born of His human mother. (Luke 2:9-11) “When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman.” (Galatians 4:4) None of the imperfect blood of the imperfect Adam was in the veins of Jesus, because His life was begotten or begun by the power of Jehovah. When He became a man, therefore, He was “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners”. (Hebrews 7:26) As a man He exactly corresponded to what the perfect man Adam was before he sinned. Therefore the man Jesus was capable of becoming the Redeemer of Adam and his race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But could the perfect man Jesus provide redemption for Adam and all of the human race? The answer is: Yes; Jehovah has purposed it thus. One man was the father of the entire human family. One perfect man can redeem the whole human family, as the apostle puts it in Romans 5:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But one may ask: Why should Jehovah send the posterity of Adam into death? They were not on trial. Note the words of the apostle. He does not say that all men were </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sentenced</span><span class="font7"> to death. He does say that all men were condemned to death. Where there is a sentence of death there must of necessity be a trial preceding. Condemnation means disapproval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A bridge is maintained across a stream until the bridge becomes unsafe; then it is condemned, because it is unsafe. It is no fault of the bridge. The fault lies in the material out of which it is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No man made himself. No child brought itself into the world. God gave Adam and Hve the power to propagate the race. As they were imperfect when this power was exercised, their children were brought forth imperfect. God cannot approve an imperfect thing. It was not the fault of the child. It is the fault of the material out of which it is made. Being disapproved, it is condemned; but this condemnation and disapproval are the result of Adam’s sin. Therefore all came under condemnation; and Jehovah has provided that through the righteousness of His beloved Son the free gift of life shall come to all men, giving to them an opportunity to obey Him and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now we find Jesus on earth at thirty years of age, a perfect man and at the legal age required. Why had He come to earth? Jehovah had promised to ransom the human race. (Hosea 13:14) The law required a perfect man’s life to provide the ransom. Jesus said that He came to give His life a ransom.—Matthew 20: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Ransom” means, literally, 'Something to loosen with; a redemptive price.’ Stated in other phrase, it means the price or value which can be used in loosening or releasing something that is in bondage, restraint or imprisonment. Necessarily the ransom price must be equivalent to or exactly corresponding with, that which justice requires of the thing or creature in bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The right to live as a human creature was required by the judgment against Adam. This judgment took away Adam’s right to live. That which would provide a ransom price must be the right of another human creature to live. The perfect man Jesus possessed exactly that thing, namely, the right to live on earth as a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The redemption of man from death and its effects, and deliverance therefrom, is the expressed will of Jehovah. (1 Timothy 2: 4) Jesus came to do the will of God, as it is written of Him: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font7">my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” —Psalm 40: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah having promised to ransom man, now He had provided a way to carry out His promise by His Son’s willingly becoming a man. “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” (Philippians 2: 8) Jesus willingly submitted to death; because it was the will of Jehovah to thereby provide the ransom price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the question, Why must Jesus die? is answered briefly. The perfect man Jesus, while He remained alive, could not provide a ransom price. He must now convert His perfect human life into an asset of value, which asset would be sufficient to release man from judgment and from the condemnation resulting from that judgment. He must lay down His human life that the value thereof might be presented to divine justice instead or in place of that which Adam had forfeited, to the end that Adam and his race might have an opportunity to live. Otherwise stated, Jesus must make His human life and the right thereto a legal tender for the payment of Adam’s debt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Legal tender” means currency, money, measure of value, which the law requires and receives in satisfaction of debts or obligations. “Merit” means value gained. By the merit of Christ Jesus we mean the perfect humanity of Jesus and all the rights incident thereto converted into value or an asset, which is legal tender for the payment of man’s debt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To illustrate this point: Take a man, whom we will call John for convenience, who is languishing in prison to satisfy a fine of a hundred dollars, because of his inability to pay that fine. John’s brother Charles is willing to pay that fine, but he has no money with which to pay. Charles is strong and vigorous, has time to work and is willing to work; but his strength and time and willingness will not pay the debt for his brother John. Smith desires someone to work for him, and has the money with which to pay. Charles engages himself to work for Smith, and earns a hundred dollars in cash and receives it. Thereby Charles has reduced his time, strength and vigor into money value, which has purchasing power, and which is legal tender for the purpose of payment of John’s obligations. This money may properly be called merit, because of its purchasing value or redemptive value. Charles then appears before the court which entered the judgment against his brother, and offers to pay the hundred dollars which the law demands of John. The court accepts the hundred dollars and releases John. John is thereby judicially released from the judgment; and his brother Charles has become his ransomer, or redeemer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adam was the son of God. It was judicially determined by Jehovah that Adam should forfeit his life in death, which judgment would mean the eternal death of Adam and all of his offspring unless he and they should be redeemed. As Adam possessed the power’ to beget children before this judicial determination but had not exercised that power, all of Adam’s offspring came under the effects of the judgment. He is now held in death to meet the requirements of the law. The entire human race is in a similar condition, resulting from the original sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus, the perfect man, the Son of God, was designated by Jehovah as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The</span><span class="font7"> Son of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font7"> man”; this title implying that He, being the only perfect man that has lived on the earth since Adam, was entitled to everything that belonged to Adam, life and all the blessings incident thereto. Jesus had the power to produce a perfect race of people, and was in every respect the exact equal of Adam before Adam sinned. It was the will of God that Jesus should redeem Adam and his posterity. Jesus was willing to pay Adam’s debt and redeem him; but the perfect, righteous human creature Jesus could not accomplish that purpose while living in the flesh, for the same reason that Charles could not use his strength, time and energy to pay the debt of his brother John, but must first reduce these to a purchasing value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus must reduce His perfect humanity to a measure of value (which measure of value we call merit), which value or merit constitutes legal tender for the payment of the debt of Adam and his offspring, furnishing the price sufficient to judicially release them all. To provide this ransom price Jesus must die. But to present the value of it before Jehovah He must live again and have access to the court of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Jordan river the perfect man Jesus presented himself in consecration to do the will of Jehovah; and it was God’s will that Jesus should there lay down His life in death, but that He should </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not forfeit the legal right to life as a man.</span><span class="font7"> It was the will of Jehovah that Christ should be raised out of death a divine creature, and as such should take up the merit or right or value of His perfect human life and use it as an asset or legal tender in harmony with the divine will, namely, to judicially release mankind and to provide life for the human race. Why not use the term “legally release”? The Lord could not provide for an illegal release of the human race, because He must be just. The term “judicially release” is here used because that means that the release is done in a judicial capacity or manner, by the one having authority to release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This argument is in harmony with the statement of Jesus: “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they [the people, the human race] might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. Therefore doth my Father love me, because </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">I lag down mg life, that I might take it again.</span><span class="font7"> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself [willingly]. Z </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">have power to lag it down, and I have power to take it again.</span><span class="font7"> This commandment have I received of my Father.”—John 10:10, 11, 15, 17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan has done much to blind the minds of earnest searchers of the truth concerning the philosophy of the ransom. He has made some believe that it was provided for the benefit of only a few, and that all others are predestinated to be lost. He has made others believe that it has no value whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For whom did Jesus die? This question must be answered from the Scriptures. Everyone should desire to know the truth. “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) It would seem strange that God would provide for His blessing to extend to a few, and not grant a similar privilege to all. The Scriptures answer: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”—John 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul discusses this matter; and writing (as we know) under inspiration, he declared it to be the will of God that by virtue of the ransom price all men should be redeemed from death and that then each one must be given a knowledge of Jehovah’s arrangement, to the end that each one may have the opportunity to exercise his free moral agency and accept or reject the offer of life that comes through the ransom sacrifice. His argument is this: “God . . . will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” —1 Timothy 2: 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus far only a few of the human family have come to a knowledge of the truth concerning Jehovah’s provision through Christ Jesus for man’s recovery from death; but the Almighty assures us that all will have opportunity in His due time. Jehovah's witnesses are now telling the people of the nations that Jehovah is about to rise up to the prey and destroy all nations which have oppressed mankind. It will be after the battle at Armageddon that the time will be opportune for the people to receive the pure and unadulterated truth as never before, because Jehovah has promised to turn to them a pure message.—Zephaniah 3:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this brief examination of this subject we can clearly discern from the Scriptures that Jehovah is the source of all life. On account of His great love for mankind, He gave His only begotten Son in order to provide the necessary ransom price for the deliverance of mankind. Through the arrangements of Jehovah each one of the Adamic stock will have received an opportunity to avail himself of this great gift of God. Since Jehovah is the Great God and the Giver of all blessings, including life itself, all thanksgiving and praise are due to His name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">H</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">arold Johnson, a hard-working, honest young man, with wife and two children, had been out of work three weeks, at Farmington, Missouri, but finally, in July, got work with the Wunderlicht Construction Company, at road-building. The word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wunderlicht</span><span class="font7"> means “Miracle Light”. The way it worked out was that no drinking water was provided on the job. It would have cost a few cents a day to provide it, and that would have cut down profits. Two of the men on the job went to a farmhouse for a drink, but were fired when they got back. Men are plentiful in these days, and work is scarce. It was roasting hot and he was thirsty, but Johnson loved his wife and children so much that he went without water until 4:30 in the afternoon. Then he drank long and deeply; he was so overheated that it killed him. His family is suing the construction company for damages. If they have to pay about $50,000 they may get some much needed wonderful light on how to treat their men.</span></p>
