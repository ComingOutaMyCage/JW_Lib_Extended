<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Latin America—The Question Mark of the 20th Century</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Five Parts—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Argentina—Land of Promise</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">E TREATED this subject in full in No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">333, and so merely touch here a few items which have come to notice during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By now you have all heard about North America’s famous financiers, the kind that charge you three times what Canada does for electric current, and lend your savings to South Americans —push it on them in fact. Now the latter are sorry they borrowed. The interest charges consume one-third of all Argentina’s annual revenue, and she hates her Yankee creditors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Buenos Aires, sixth city of the world as regards population, and largest city of any kind south of the equator, has the only subway system in the Southern Hemisphere. Its streets and boulevards are among the broadest, the longest and the finest in the world, and its shops are unsurpassed. The population of Argentina is almost entirely white.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is generally agreed that the thing which has made Argentina the most progressive country in South America is the influence of one man, Sarmiento, born in the little town of San Juan, in 1811. Sarmiento had unlimited thirst for education, and unlimited ambition that others might have the same. As a direct result of his influence Argentina has today the best school system in Latin America. Iler teachers are better paid than even in the United States. (!) In marked contrast with the United States the schools of Argentina are under the direct control of the government. They have had the effect of turning the people in the direction of Socialism, with the consequent restlessness of labor, and the spread of cooperation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Argentina has a strike, everything is tied up tight. In the early part of 1919, when the dock workers’ strike was on, not a ship entered the port of Buenos Aires in three months. The temper of the Argentinians is shown in their independent withdrawal from the League of Nations, because of their belief that the present League is dominated by questions arising out of the World War and is not impartial in its handling of world problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Religion” has lost out in Argentina. The thoughtful and intelligent have turned away from the Roman Catholic church to agnosticism. What that “church” has been doing for four hundred years may be gathered from the fact that a prominent journal of Buenos Aires began printing quotations from the Bible, without giving the source, and subscribers wrote in wanting to know the source from which came the illuminating and helpful ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Argentina is probably the only land in which horses have been cheap enough and distances were great enough that, in a former generation, “beggars did ride” literally. Religious bums went around asking for alms in the name of some “saint” or else to help out the “mother of god”, or his grandmother, Saint Anne, or some other impecunious relative. How the money ever got from the bum to Mary or Anne was never made clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is still a touch of the America of a generation ago in the Gauchos of the western Argentinian plains. A. H. Tschiffely, a Swiss, recently completed a 2^-year horseback ride from Buenos Aires to Washington. He is a teacher of languages, out for a long vacation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sheep breeders in the San Julian area of the Argentine recently slaughtered and burned the carcasses of 60,000 sheep for want of a market. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Uruguay—“The Purple Land”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That little triangular-shaped country down in the southeastern corner of South America, so small that you can hardly see it, is just a little larger than the combined states of New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is called “The Purple Land” because the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">flor morada,</span><span class="font10"> the most conspicuous among flow-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ers, carpets the rich undulating plains everywhere with glowing bands and patches of richest purple. Go where one will, one finds massed banks of this blazing flower growing in such profusion that they extinguish all competitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Uruguay is about one-third Protestant. It is now paying much attention to education. State pupils at the normal schools receive pensions of $15 a month as a contribution in assisting them to meet their expenses. In hot weather the municipal council of Montevideo forbids city employees to work more than six hours per day. No one is permitted to work more than forty-eight hours per week. Old age pensions are in effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Montevideo (Mountain View) is one of the chief seaports of South America, and one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities. Nearly every language is spoken in its streets. The export trade of Uruguay in 1930 was $97,340,955. The climate is ideal, and healthy. The population, almost entirely white, is 2,036,884. British interests predominate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The United, States of Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil is larger than the whole United States of North America, and is almost as large as the whole of Europe, including Russia. It occupies a full half of the South American continent. It borders on every country of South America except Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The population is estimated at 41,079,000. About one-third of the population is white. Settlements are confined chiefly to a fringe along the Atlantic coast. To adequately colonize Brazil, subdue it, and put it under high cultivation, would require more people than are now living in the whole world, and what they could then produce would feed several times that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Near Rio de Janeiro are mountains 10,340 feet high. Yet Brazil in general is best described as the huge basin of the Amazon, regarding which river see Part 1 of this article, published </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> No. 368. In this issue we can hope to touch but a few items of interest in connection with this greatest of the question marks awaiting mankind in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil is the coffee center of the world. The total exports of products of all kinds in the year 1929 were $456,723,000. The mineral wealth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">vast but undeveloped. There are 40,000 miles </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">navigable waterways. There are 378 important waterfalls, numbering among them the Iguazu, one of the natural wonders of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The two largest states in Brazil, namely Amazonas and Matto Grosso, are—how large would you say? They are as large as California, Texas, and all that part of the United States east of the Mississippi river put together, have the finest alluvial soil, and their present combined population is less than that of Rhode Island, the smallest state in the North American Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And then there is the state of Goyaz, within the confines of which the Brazilians have marked off a federal district of 5,500 square miles within which they hope sometime to have their capital. How large is Goyaz ? Oh, a mere matter of 288,536 square miles; only a little larger than Texas. The capital would be at 8,000 feet above sea level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Harvesting Brazil Nuts</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Para; that is another big state, 443,789 square miles, as large as all of the United States east of the Mississippi river. From Para we get the Brazil nuts, or 'nigger toes’, or Para nuts, as they are sometimes called. The tree on which Brazil nuts grow is a large, straight tree that rises to a height of a hundred feet before branching. The nuts are of the size of a person’s head, weigh several pounds each, and, when ripe, fall with tremendous force, sufficient to kill. Each nut contains eighteen to twenty-four of the threesided, wrinkled kernels known to the market. They are fitted in by nature with such art that, once disturbed, the skill of man cannot replace them. Indians wait until not a breath of air is stirring, when they gather the nuts, break them open, and bring the kernels down stream to market. They do not dare venture under the trees if a breeze is blowing, as it is likely to dislodge the nuts and bring them down upon their heads. These nuts supply the finest watchmakers’ oil. They are highly esteemed as a preventive of constipation and bowel disorders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Three other states, Bahia, Maranhao and Minas Geraes, are each larger than California. And four other states, Parana, Piauhy, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo, are each the size of Colorado. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul there are more than 200,000 Germans, and considerably more than that number of Italians. The state of Sao Paulo is the coffee center of the world. Eighty-five percent of the world’s coffee comes from Brazil; 65 percent of it from the one state of Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil is a producer of rubber, cotton, sugar, dye woods, and other products too numerous to mention. The soil is so rich that plowing is not done; the only agricultural instrument used is the hoe. Corn is planted by making holes in the ground with a sharp stick and dropping the seed into the holes, but, although there is no cultivation of the soil, crops of 25 to 40 bushels to the acre are not uncommon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Amazon Valley</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of the 55 largest rivers in the world thirty-three are wholly or largely in Brazil. Not only is the Amazon the largest river in the world, but it drains an area wider than the Mississippi, Missouri, Danube and Nile combined. Seventeen of its tributaries are from 1,000 to 2,300 miles in length. Its shores are lined with impenetrable primeval forests thronged with monkeys, parrots, sloths, boa constrictors, anacondas and pumas. Its waters teem with turtles, crocodiles, waterfowl, tapirs, and fishes of at least 1,163 varieties. Half a hundred steamers suffice at present for carrying a trade that will some day fill the river with craft. Sunstroke is unknown in the Amazon valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Amazon region has its animal terrors. Scientists have measured anacondas up to thirty feet long, but frontier settlers claim that they grow to be sixty feet and that a full-grown one can lasso itself around a man on horseback and swallow him at one gulp. Hanging motionless from a tree, an anaconda can knock senseless any creature that comes within reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Sao Paulo state government maintains a snake farm, where serums to cure snake bites are prepared and distributed. It is said that the average arrivals of snakes at this farm, from all parts of Brazil, are five hundred a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A writer in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In some of the rivers are the strange piranha, a flesh-eating fish which becomes ravenous when it tastes blood. A wounded animal in the water is quickly stripped to the bone. Plagues of insects in some parts of the Amazon country drive an unprotected person to the verge of madness. Bloodsuckers mingle with others that cause deadly fevers. There are wild bees, hornets, tarantulas, ants almost as big as a man’s thumb, ticks, and ground spiders with a leg spread large enough to cover a soup plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the thing most of all to be dreaded in the Amazon region is the growth of vegetation. Bailroads can hardly be kept open. In a little while an idle locomotive had a tree growing out of its smokestack. The plant life overpowers everything. Only billions of industrious and determined men and women will ever subjugate the valley of the Amazon; but it will be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil was at one time the leading diamond country of the world. Iron ore is found in great quantities in several of the states. Coal is of poor quality, but not much needed in a land of such abundant potential water power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the projects commanding attention of capitalists is a plan to impound the waters of several rivers in the vicinity of Sao Paulo and Santos and to force them to flow backward over a mountain barrier and plunge 2,500 feet down to the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Constitution and the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The constitution of Brazil is the same as that of the United States of America, but in actual practice the component states exercise more of their state rights, and occasionally ignore and sometimes defy the federal laws. The senate, not the president, is the controlling factor in the government. Road committees in the more thickly settled parts of Brazil are now cooperating with the government in putting a network of automobile roads over the farm sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The present civilization of Brazil, especially in Sao Paulo, is highly tinctured with the characteristics and standards of three hundred high-class Portuguese families which the old king of Portugal brought with him to this new land, and of which ancestry the gentleman Brazilian is especially proud. The visitor will be told repeatedly that Brazil, unlike certain other South American republics, was not settled by a lot of adventurers, but that she was favored in having the best blood of Portugal transferred bodily to this country as a foundation of her institutions and civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The old families of Brazil are said to be very exclusive, and one is told it is very difficult for a foreigner to gain access to their homes, and that they live among themselves, intermarry, and form almost a feudal-like society. The son of one of the old Brazilian families married the daughter of an Italian multimillionaire. The young man paid for his independence of spirit by being practically ostracized from his family, his club, and from all social life in Sao Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">History tells us that the Brazilian women of Sao Paulo, in early colonial days, when their husbands returned home after a crushing defeat at the hands of the Indians, scornfully rebuked the vanquished warriors with the command, “Go back and conquer; it is only as victors that we will receive you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people of Brazil in general, however, are an unusual people engaged in an unusual experiment. A general fusion of whites, Negroes and Indians is in progress. No color line is drawn, absolutely none, in business, government or socially, with the result that a new race is coming into existence. These people are sober, quiet and serious. They are not drinkers. If it were not for the whites there would not be a bar-room in the country. Most Brazilians think of Americans as a wild, fighting, cursing, illiterate, drunken people; and for this they cannot be blamed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil is such a large country that it has many distinctly different tribes of Indians. Some of these are much more debased than the North American Indians (one tribe of black dwarfs lives in holes covered over with leaves and sticks); but an explorer, J. G. Culbertson, says of one of the tribes which he visited, the Machigina, that “the South American interior is today the safest place I know; safer than any of our cities. The people are the most honest people I have found in the world. Nowhere in the world is a woman so respected as among these people, and the only danger to the explorers comes through disrespect of the native women”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another explorer, Geo. R. White, in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">South American Messenger</span><span class="font10"> says: “With one honorable exception, all the Roman Catholic priests with whom I came in contact during my journey were immoral, drunken and ignorant; every mission which they had started had utterly failed to accomplish the Christianizing of the Indians, and the tribes who have come under priestly care are decidedly inferior in morals, industry and order to the tribes who refuse to have any intercourse whatever with the whites.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil was originally called the country of brazilwood by that ubiquitous gentleman, Amerigo Vespucci, who had such a remarkable faculty of naming things and having the names stick. Amerigo thought that the country would be famous for supplying a dye needed in Europe. But Brazil has done more than furnish dyes for man’s exterior adornment. Think of the coffee with which she has decorated his insides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Greatest Storehouse and Its Capital</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The world’s greatest storehouse of materials is in Brazil. Thus far civilization has done little more than stand upon the threshold and gaze upon a land which will sometime house billions of people, literally. Here is a land larger than the combined area of the United States of America and a goodly portion of western Europe thrown in, traversed from end to end with the greatest system of navigable rivers on the planet, a soil that will produce anything, and a good foundation already laid for the country's development, which will now take place rapidly. Even now its capital and chief city, Rio de Janeiro, with its million population, claims to be the world's most beautiful city, and there seems to be no doubt that in its natural setting the claim is well made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brazil has been somewhat delayed in development because its people have felt that Europeans and North Americans could not be trusted, and they have therefore neglected to seek and to use the capital which is needed and is available. They wish to have their country developed, but do not care to see its profits carried elsewhere. They do not wish to see the Brazilian people work for low wages in order that great financiers in Europe and America may have more than heart can wish. They prefer to wait a little and have their own people reap the rewards which are sure to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The national capital, Rio de Janeiro, is confidently claimed to have the most beautiful driveways in the world. One of these skirts the shore for miles. On the one side are broad mosaic walks; on the other the waves rushing and roaring and breaking on snow-white sands; in the center are parkw’ays filled with tropical palms and flowers. At the end of the driveway is Sugarloaf Mountain, access to the top of which is gained by an electric basket cable car for twenty passengers. The view from the top is magnificent. At another point Mt. Corcovado, 2,200 feet high, is ascended by a cog railway; and the view is unsurpassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rio de Janeiro’s water supply and sanitation are strictly up to date, and there is an almost total absence of flies and mosquitoes, so much so that no screens are used. The hot months are December, January and February. Winter comes in June, July and August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The shopping center of Rio de Janeiro, the Rua Ovidor, is unlike any other shopping district in the Western world or perhaps on the globe. The street is barely 25 feet wide, but no wheel traffic of any kind is permitted, and the street proper is paved with glazed tiling, as well as the sidewalks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The shops have no front walls, but open out directly on the street, and it is confidently claimed that there is nothing anywhere in the world that money can buy that is not to be found in those shops. Moreover, it is characteristic of all shops in Brazil, even in the smallest towns, that the polishing cloth is in constant use, so that the glass is unspecked and the woodwork at all times is absolutely dustless. A writer says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It is difficult to explain the seductive charm of Rio de Janeiro. Certain places hold one by a sense of remoteness, others by the spell of natural beauty. Rio is one of these cities which combine the old and the new, in such an atmosphere of tropical splendor and color as to make an unforgettable impression. It is an example of the tropic-clad statuary of nature at her best. I know of no city in the world that is more engaging than Rio, with its one million of inhabitants, resting peacefully in bright sunlight on the ankles of her great hills. There is something quieting and beautifully magic about the sea in Rio bay. Outside of imagination, there is naught elsewhere that approaches its charm, and he who stays long enough to really experience it is like one who dreams. The sea here is of the same color as the soft chiffon-like mist of gray that veils continuously the surrounding hills. It is probably the utter harmony to the eye that comforts one here and induces repose, or it may be the ‘always-afternoon’ softness of the air that breathes about one a quiet peace.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I’ll, you are a mule, the son of a jackass, and I am a man made in the image of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet, here we work, hitched up together, year in and year out. I often wonder if you work for me or if I work for you. Verily, I think it a partnership between a mule and a fool, for surely I work as hard as you, if not harder. Plowing or cultivating we cover the same distance, but you do it on four legs and I on two. I, therefore, do twice as much work per leg as you do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Soon we’ll be preparing for a corn crop. When the crop is harvested I give one-third to the landlord for being so kind as to let me use this small speck of God’s universe. One-third goes to you, and the balance is mine. You consume all of your portion with the exception of the cobs, while I divide mine among seven children, six hens, two ducks and a gander. If we both need shoes, you get ’em. Bill, you are getting the best of me, and I ask you, is it fair for a mule, a son of a jackass, to swindle a man—a lord of creation—out of his substance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why, you only help to plow and cultivate the ground, and I alone must cut, shock and husk the corn, while you look over the pasture fence and heehaw at me.</span></p>

And what do you care about the mortgage? Not a damn! You ornery cuss, I even have to do the worrying about the mortgage on your tough, ungrateful hide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About the only time I am your better is on election day, for I can vote and you can't. And after election I realize that I was fully as great a jackass as your papa. Verily, I ain prone to wonder if politics were made for men or jackasses of men.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Watson Experiments on Dogs</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TT SEEMS that Dr. A. B. Watson, A.M., M.D., hoisted 141 dogs to the coiling, and dropped them upon their backs upon iron bars in such manner as to produce concussion of the spine. When the results of these experiments were published under the title “An Experimental Study of Lesions Arising from Severe Concussions”, the British Medical Journal said of the whole thing: “The present pamphlet calls for our strongest reprobation, as a record of the most wanton and stupidest cruelty we have ever seen chronicled under the guise of scientific experiments. Apart from the utterly useless nature of the observations as far as regards human surgery or pathology, there is a callous indifference shown in the description of the sufferings of the poor brutes which is positively revolting. We cannot but feel ashamed of the work as undertaken by a member of our profession.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Curse of Interest </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Hugo R. Fack {Texas)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font10">IX percent interest means that every hundred dollars of capital doubles itself every sixteen years; and computed at compound interest, in twelve years. A higher rate of interest, 7 or 8 percent, does it in even much shorter time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since nothing is produced without payment of interest on the money-capital invested, all products contain a large interest ingredient in their prices. For bread and for clothing, for housing and for coffins, we have to pay interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All houses, factories, bridges, structures of all kinds, pavements, etc., are capitalized, i.e., rendered interest-exacting. Thus the whole of accumulated national wealth functions as a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">debt,</span><span class="font10"> requiring interest payment to those that own it. Four hundred billions of dollars of national wealth require, at 6 percent interest, 24 billions of dollars. That is about 40 percent of the proceeds of production of the whole nation. Thus about 40 percent is taken away from producers for interest payment to the owners of the wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Consider! The gigantic wealth of the nation is handed over the counter in form of interest every twelve to sixteen years to those who own the wealth. Four times in a life time, while the producing masses never get it once during their lives. No wonder that, according to statistics compiled during “prosperous” times, 87 percent of the nation possess practically nothing, 10 percent of them a meager 3 percent of the wealth, and the remaining 3 percent of the nation, 97 percent of the so-called “national” wealth. Such was distribution during “prosperous” times in this land of opportunity, in this land of the free. Similar or even worse are the conditions in other nations. They all belong to the brotherhood of poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Money-capital serves only on condition of safe and adequate interest. At the gateway of all production and distribution stands the toll house of usury. No money-capital is available for building a house unless the house can bring the same rate of interest as money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, the capacity of commodities, of houses, plants, ships, etc., to exact interest is decreased by continued production of such real capital. The more houses built, the lower the yield. Therefore money-capital always withdraws from production when continued production endangers its power to exact interest tribute. Panic sets in, initiating the general business depression. The decreased demand held by money for all the multifarious products necessary for the construction of real capital makes a so-called “overproduction” appear. Prices begin to fall, leading to disruption of business and trade, to increased unemployment and to general economic and cultural misery. At the same time money gains in value according to the fall of prices. Only when production has been so diminished as to correspond to the little demand held by money, and “surplus production” been consumed, are conditions for interest exaction restored and economic life is again allowed to start on the upward trend, but only to end in the same economic catastrophe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus interest stands in the way of human wants and thwarts their satisfaction. Human action is deflected from the satisfaction of want or desire to the payment of interest. No interest, no money; no money, no production; no production, no employment; no employment, misery, deprivation in a thousand forms, hunger, crime and despair. Such is the answer of present-day money to human diligence and will to create.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore the one great need of our time is the replacement of present-day money, refusing to serve when the interest begins to sink, by a money serving relentlessly regardless of the sinking and finally disappearing interest rate through increasing wealth. The volume of such continually active money to be so regulated by a Federal Currency Board as to maintain the general price level by which money’s true standard as an economic measure of value is assured, which is impossible to accomplish with the hoardable present-day money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Money rules the world. Money is the real ruler behind capitalistic and communistic governments, behind republics and monarchies, behind democracies and dictatorships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Man created money, not to rule, but to serve. Money should be solely a medium of exchange for man’s multifarious products and services in this economic order based on division of labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Products and services represent the side of supply on the market. On account of the perishable nature of products, and of the cost of upkeep, storage fees, changes of fashion, new inventions, etc., they are presented for exchange with the least delay possible. And man himself would starve to death, in case he had nothing to sell, did he not offer his services. Thus the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">supply,</span><span class="font10"> products and services, stands under the inherent urge for exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">demand,</span><span class="font10"> represented by </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">money</span><span class="font10"> in this economic order, does not stand under such inherent compulsion. Only about 20 percent of all the money issued is directly used to satisfy immediate vital human wants. The remaining 80 percent can be withheld or hoarded without loss to the holder, because money costs nothing to store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;When prices and wages have fallen because of money’s withdrawal from the market, thus reducing the purchasing power of the masses; when values have been shattered, savings consumed or lost in the resultant business and bank failures; when the possessions of the debtor class have been shifted over to the creditor class; when bankruptcies have done their havoc all over the country; then the conditions for “rentability” become gradually restored: prices fall no more. Then money-capital knows that a new period of harvesting is about to start, and that the sooner it comes out of its hiding places the more favorable its terms for investment, the bigger the profits in the new boom period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And, after all, money-capital did not fare badly whilst in hiding. It increased in value 30, 40, 50 percent, and was thus amply compensated for loss of interest. And what a harvest money garnered during the depression! But now the harvesting goes in the other direction. The arrest in the price fall is the signal of the turn of the tide. Money comes out and forces prices to rise. This accelerates circulation and exchange, and produces a period of prosperity lasting until the continued production of real wealth again menaces interest rates. Then money again goes on strike. Panic and depression set in. This is followed by another period of production, but of shorter duration. The increasing output capacity of modern machinery completes the business cycle of boom and depression in less and less time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is the strike of money that throws the nation into economic depression, into social and cultural turmoil and disintegration. The money strike is the one and universal cause of all economic crises of the past and present. Idle money creates idle men. Set money to work and man will be allowed to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore the circulation of money is a matter of life and death for all nations. But as all efforts to talking money into circulation have been fruitless, money must be put under inherent compulsion to circulate. This will deprive it of its pernicious power to interrupt service and drag industry and trade down from one crisis to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let us therefore impose on money such a hoarding penalty as will compel it to circulate unconditionally, just as the railroads penalize with a demurrage fee those who delay freight car traffic. Money is but a carrier of goods and services. The hoarding and withholding of money should therefore be heavily fined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To keep money in regular circulation, an antihoarding tax should be levied. The holders of money bills should be required to place stamps at regular intervals in specially provided spaces. The antihoarding tax should be heavy enough to absorb the interest rate. A 12-percent antihoarding tax annually, for example, would require a one-percent stamp monthly, or a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">½  </span><span class="font10">percent stamp semimonthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Such money will create active demand up to its full amount. The volume of such money issued will represent effective demand on the market. Increased issue will mean increased demand. Decreased issue will mean decreased demand. Therefore, by regulation of the money issue the ratio between supply and demand can be maintained and the general price level stabilized. The value of money is then safeguarded for all times. Money agreements can never again be falsified by a fluctuating money “value”. Deflations and panics will belong to the past. The relentless circulation of money, and its volume regulation, will create a permanent period of prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nobody will be able to hoard such service money. Self-interest will impel everybody to dispose of it as soon as possible. Everyone will accelerate his purchases or pay his obligations, or invest his spare in credit accounts of all kinds. The last unemployed man will be called from the street, and production will go on without interruption as long as man has unsatisfied desires for material necessities, for comforts, refinement and beauty. There is no need for technocracy. The more machines, the better for man. There will be shortage of labor instead of shortage of jobs. Production will unfold to an extent the world has never seen before, and the increase of wealth will drown the interest rate. Working incomes will increase many times, savings multiply ten- or twentyfold.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8">(Reprinted from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 109, by request.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">U</span><span class="font10">NDER the above title the Macfadden Publications, Ine., of New York city published a book of 183 pages by the health expert Bernarr Macfadden, which is bristling with facts that all should know regarding the tobacco habit. Some of these facts are concealed from the public, because so many physicians use tobacco themselves, and because there are men whose constitutions are so strong that they can be subjected to almost any abuse. Additionally, there is a great difference between the mild injuries wrought by merely passing smoke through the buccal and nasal cavities and the serious injuries caused by inhaling the smoke into the lungs. We select some items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">National Dispensatory</span><span class="font10"> is a volume which is in constant use by physicians and druggists. It contains the sum of their knowledge as to the effects of various drugs upon the human system. In its fifth edition, page 1576, it has the following to say regarding tobacco and nicotine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘ ‘ The cases of serious illness produced by the emanations of tobacco, and by its application to the unbroken skin, are innumerable, and many instances of fatal poisoning by tobacco are recorded ; some of them being due to its having been swallowed purposely or accidentally, some to its use medicinally in an enema, and some to its application to eruptions on the skin. Nicotine stands next to prussic acid in the rapidity and energy of its poisonous action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The comparison of nicotine with prussic acid is good. One drop of prussic acid placed on the tongue of a human kills like a stroke of lightning. One drop of nicotine on the unbroken skin of a rabbit has caused its death. If injected hypodermically, there is sufficient nicotine in a single cigarette to cause the death of a human that has never used tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nicotine is not the only evil thing in tobacco. When the tobacco is burned, seventy percent of the nicotine is turned into pyridin and collidin; the remaining thirty percent of nicotine is inhaled. Pyridin is so poisonous that it is one of the agents used for denaturing alcohol; that is, it is used for making the deadly alcohol even less fit for drink than it ordinarily would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How It Ruins the Blood</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When tobacco is burned another of the poisons which is produced is carbon monoxide. In discussing the effect of this poison upon the blood, Dr. D. H. Kress says that it is almost as</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">deadly as nicotine, being the poison found in marsh and illuminating gas. He then proceeds to show that tobacco smokers are committing slow’ suicide, whether they know it or not, when he says of carbon monoxide:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Many of the suicides committed in America are due to this poison. It is quite common to read of the gas jet being turned on at night before retiring. Death in these cases is due to asphyxiation from carbon monoxide. The blood naturally takes up all poisons conveyed to it by inhalation. Most of the gases present in the air are fortunately given off by the blood about as readily as they are taken on. With carbon monoxide it is quite different. It enters into, or forms a staple or fixed compound with the hemoglobin or coloring matter of the red blood cells. The blood readily takes it up, but lacks the ability to give it off. It accumulates and ultimately destroys the red blood cells and the function of the blood in conveying oxygen to the tissues.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is not the only way in which the smoking of tobacco tends to ruin the blood. The place where the blood goes to be cleansed of its impurities is in the two thousand square feet of surface of the lungs. There the air is taken in; but if smoke is inhaled with the air, the cleansing process is impeded. Prof. Jay Seaver, of Yale University, reports a decidedly impaired lung capacity on the part of habitual smokers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The blood is ruined in a third way by the smoking of tobacco. The heart becomes so impaired that it cannot feed a fresh supply of the life-giving fluid to all parts of the body as it was wont to do. Because the system is filled with worn-out cells which it cannot remove, the heart automatically pumps harder in the effort to effect a cleansing, until at length it weakens, skipping an occasional beat; and finally the serious state known as smokers' heart makes its appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How It Ruins the Nerves</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nicotine at first slows the heart and increases the blood pressure; subsequently the blood pressure is lowered and the heart action becomes rapid. The effect on the brain is essentially narcotic, or depressing. Now<sup>7</sup> it happens that the brain is the center of the nervous system; and when it is adversely affected, all the nervous system is deranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are many who say that they smoke to quiet their nerves. Tobacco does quiet the nerves at first; but like any other narcotic, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">becomes necessary to use more and more to produce the quieting effect, until at length the victim becomes a slave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Moreover, although tobacco quiets the nerves up to a certain point, yet when that point is passed and the smoker takes one cigar too many, or one cigarette too many, the nerves go in the opposite direction, and the smoker is almost sure to seek relief in strong drink. Smoking is an ideal path to lead to liquor indulgence. The two habits naturally go together. One who uses both liquor and tobacco can hardly stop drinking unless he first gives up smoking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another of the poisons that are manufactured when one smokes tobacco is furfurol. It is the furfurol in cigarette smoke that causes the characteristic twitching and tremor that distinguishes the cigarette addict, and betrays even to unprofessional eyes the unstable condition of his nervous system. The smoke of one cigarette may contain as much furfurol as two ounces of bad whisky, and it is the furfurol that constitutes the source of danger in improperly aged whisky. Whisky and cigarettes are cousins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the World War thousands of young men who never even knew the taste of tobacco were shamed into the use of the weed. Many of these boys have become confirmed addicts of one of the most deplorable nerve-corrupting habits that it is possible for a human to acquire, and one of the most difficult to overcome, unless sufficient remains of the moral stamina to aid in a fight that is all too often a losing venture. (This must make hard reading to the Y. M. C. A., champion cigarette salesmen of the war period.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How It Ruins the Brain</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tobacco dulls the memory, and interferes with association of ideas. In fifty years no inveterate user of tobacco has ever carried off the first prize at Harvard. Dr. George L. Maylan, of Columbia University, found that the ratio of failures of smokers as compared with nonsmokers was ten to four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But how about the brilliant men who claim that their thoughts flow more readily under the use of tobacco? The answer is at hand. They are simply in the same case with any other drug habitue, whose thoughts cannot flow readily except under the accustomed indulgence. These brilliant men would be as brilliant all the time, if they did not smoke, as they are now only when they do smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cigarettes destroy the precision of the brain and its accuracy for both thought and work, as well as desire for thought and work. Many judges have pointed out that almost without exception the gunmen, gangsters, criminals and professional prostitutes are addicted to the excessive use of cigarettes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The volume presents the testimony of five physicians that tobacco causes insanity. One of these, Doctor Bancroft, of the New Hampshire Asylum, at Concord, declares that he has known several cases of insanity that were unquestionably produced by the use of tobacco without any other complicating causes. Dr. Woodward, of the Massachusetts Insane Asylum, quite agrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Forbes Winslow, a leading English psychiatrist, declares that the true causes for insanity are the vices, not the worries, of civilization. Of the three leading causes he puts drink first, cigarette smoking second, and heredity third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font10"> has made a study of this matter; and its statistics go to show that in nine cases out of eleven, where insanity has resulted from excessive drinking, the primary cause of the condition was smoking. Dr. Winslow agrees with this, making the interesting observation that much of the degeneracy formerly attributed to alcohol is due to alcohol </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">plus</span><span class="font10"> tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How It Ruins the Boys</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Cesne, a French physician, examined thirtyeight boy cigarette smokers between nine and fifteen years of age. Twenty-two had marked circulatory disturbances and heart palpitation; thirteen had intermittent pulse; eight had decided anemia; four had ulcerated mouths; one had consumption; several suffered from nosebleed, insomnia and nightmare—all as a result of tobacco addiction. Tobacco stunts the growth of boys mentally and physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A small piece of tobacco placed on the tongue of a boy who has never used tobacco will cause nausea, vomiting, and serious disturbance of the heart and circulatory system. Man is the only fool among the animals that will make friends a second time with any such plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thomas A. Edison refused to employ anyone addicted to the habit of smoking cigarettes, asserting that the acrolein, which is still another poison generated in smoking, “has a violent action on the nerve centers, producing degeneracy of the brain, which is quite rapid among boys. Unlike most narcotics, this degeneration is permanent and uncontrollable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Judge Gemmill, of the Court of Domestic Relations of Chicago, asserts that without exception, every boy appearing before him who had lost the faculty of blushing was a cigarette fiend. The judges in general have a poor opinion of the boys who use cigarettes. They say of them that their ideas of property rights, of the value of telling the truth, and often of common decency, are distorted; that they are prone to lie, steal, and become addicted to liquor; that they become gangsters, and that almost every youthful criminal who goes to the electric chair goes there smoking a cigarette. (Y. M. C. A., please take note.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On April 1, 1900, the Japanese Government forbade the sale of cigarettes and tobacco in any form to young men under twenty years of age, on the ground that tobacco, like opium, contains narcotic poisons which benumb the nervous system and weaken the mental power of children addicted to smoking, and thus give a death-blow to the vitality of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How It Ruins the Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Drs. George Fisher and Elmer Berry, both prominently connected with the Y. M. C. A, subjected to experiments a number of ball players between twenty-one and twenty-five years of age. First each man had ten throws at a target, and the results were registered. After a half hour’s rest he had ten more throws; and there was an increase in accuracy of 9 percent. Then he smoked one cigar and rested another half hour; and there was a decrease from the original accuracy amounting to 12 percent. Then he smoked two cigars and rested one hour; and there was a decrease from the original accuracy amounting to 14.4 percent. See what the cigars did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Frederick J. Pack, another physician interested in athletics, kept a record of the results obtained by 210 men who contested for athletic honors, and found that the non-smokers surpassed the smokers with a difference of 32 percent. In other words, the average man who smokes is only two-thirds the man he would be if he did not smoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The smoking of tobacco hardens the arteries. The lower animals, when subjected to the fumes, develop hardening of the arteries quickly. Man is a tougher animal. Designed by the Creator to live everlastingly he must needs put forth more effort to destroy himself; but he succeeds in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The smoking of tobacco causes the tissues to lose their elasticity; it causes Bright’s disease and apoplexy, degeneration of the heart, weakness of vision, and in some cases total blindness. Lip cancer and cancer of the tongue and throat have been traced to the irritation of the pipe stem, the hot smoke and the ammonia “bite”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Among the concerns that either refuse to hire new men who use tobacco or that put restrictions of some kind regarding its use are the following: The H. J. Heinz Company, Pennsylvania Railroad, Pittsburgh &amp;&nbsp;Lake Erie Railroad, National Cash Register Company, Cadillac Company, Fifth Avenue Bank, Larkin Company, Burroughs Adding Machine Company, Marshall Field’s, John Wanamaker, Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Wright Tire Company, and Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. This is doubtless a very incomplete list.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How It Ruins the Nation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most nations that we know anything about are composed of people; and the use of tobacco tends to keep them from coming on the scene at all. Statistics prove that women who are addicted to the habit of smoking have a smaller number of children, pro rata, than do nonsmoking women, and that the health of these children is far more unstable than that of children of non-smoking women. Breast-fed babies imbibe nicotine directly from their mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. D. H. Kress, previously quoted as showing how tobacco ruins the blood, asserts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The cigarette causes glandular degeneracy, and naturally the sexual glands degenerate with the other glands of the body. The products of tobacco smoke, which destroy insects exposed to it, are also highly injurious to the delicate cell from which the child is developed. In countries where cigarette using has become common among women, the decline in birth rate is most rapid.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The annual fire loss in the United States caused by smoking, and properly chargeable to this cause, is $50,000,000. Besides this, the smokers annually murder hundreds of innocent people by burning them to death. Moreover, the odor that arises from a confirmed smoker is exceedingly distasteful to many, especially to those of refined taste and cleanly habits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The number of cigarettes sold in America increased from 2,000,000,000 in 1900 to 100,000,-000,000 in 1928. This number end to end would girdle the globe one hundred and twenty-five times. Fifty percent of the boys over twelve years of age smoke cigarettes. Myriads of young men are reaching for them, and reaching for premature death. Tobacco workers have the highest death rate from tuberculosis, excepting only the stone and marble cutters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The amount spent on tobacco in the United States is more than the value of all the metals, iron, copper, gold, silver, etc., mined in the country in the same period; it is more than the total cost of education from the kindergarten to the university inclusive; it is almost double the value of all the anthracite and bituminous coal mined; it puts to the basest use 1,446,600 acres of the very finest lands in these United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The smoking of tobacco had its origin among the savages of North America in a religious ceremony allied to devil worship. The savages burned the tobacco in the belief that the fumes would have a tendency to pacify their angry and avenging deities. The medicine men, in direct touch with the demons, and under their influence, were the first users. The habit traces directly back to the Devil. It is part of his empire. It will have to go. In Messiah’s kingdom there will be no use for tobacco except, perhaps, to kill vermin. It is said to be very good for that purpose.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>The Habits of Rats</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N COLD weather rats live in colonies of twenty-five to sixty; in summer the colonies are less. The individuals change their positions constantly, so as to give each rat some opportunity to enjoy the warmest place at the bottom of the pile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When well fed they are peaceable, but when hunger comes they turn cannibals, fathers and mothers eating their own children, and rats eating one another. The father rats are the worst; the mothers protect their young from destruction as long as they can, even going to the limit of killing their young ones rather than have them slain by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'When the young rats get to a certain age the mothers lose all interest in them; they must fight for themselves. All feeble rats in the colony are exterminated by the robust ones. No mercy is shown. If a group of rats is confined in a cage and not fed, they will eat one another until but one rat remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Kats begin to breed at six months of age, the female breeding eight times a year and having as many as fourteen at a litter. In three years’ time a single pair of New York rats living in good circumstances, it is estimated, will have 650,000 descendants. When well cooked, rat meat is said to have a fine flavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'When roused to fury by having its tail cut off and its hair burned a rat has been known to entirely rid premises of its own kind. Such a rat will attack anything. Rats have been known to attack horses, babies, and even grown persons who were invalids. There is nothing they will not eat, and they do not hesitate to try cutting their way through brick or even granite to make an opening large enough for admission into a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fondness of the rat for good music has often been noted. The music of a harmonica, if soft, mild and pathetic, will actually cause tears to course down its cheeks; but if the music be harsh, shrill and discordant, as from a brass instrument in the hands of a beginner, every rat will leave the premises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The rat’s nest is always in an out-of-the-way place, in the dark and gloom. As a natural result its vision is extremely poor. In the daytime, in a bright light, it can see next to nothing; in the darkness it can see better, its greatest natural enemy is the ferret, which can be trained to go in and clean out an entire colony, sucking the blood and eating out the brains of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heath Fires in England</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N THE midst of the driest spell ever observed in England, early in September, heath fires broke out, destroying the vegetation on thousands of acres. Flames at times forty feet high leaped the main road between London and Southampton. Motorists rescued the occupants of cottages in the path of the flames. Some districts were forced to restrict the use of water to a few hours per day. At Middleton, Suffolk, the only supply of water was at the rectory, and the rector would give water only to those who attended his church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font10">URING- this time of great depression it is a boon to the farmers to have a method discovered whereby they can fertilize the ground without much extra expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While in North Dakota I came in contact with some farmers who were once Catholics. They left their religious convictions and became Watch Tower publication readers. The priest of the parish to which they formerly belonged came to one of the farmers and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'•'Paul, you must give father $200.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paul said: “I will give father nothing. Why should I give you $200?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The priest answered, “You were once a Catholic” ; to which Paul replied, “We are not Catholics now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That makes no difference; you must give father $200 or else I will curse your farm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To this Paul replied, “Go ahead and curse all you want to.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At this the priest got into his car and cursed the farm from the north, east, south and west corners, saying: “Cursed be this farm, cursed be the cattle, cursed be the crops, cursed be this man, cursed be this woman.” He continued until he had cursed the whole business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In due time the cursed crop grew, and grew, and when it was harvested Paul had a bumper crop. After the harvest he met the priest on the street and said to him: “Say, father, you certainly did a good job of cursing my farm.” To this the priest said vehemently: “Yes, your farm is cursed!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paul said: “Could you do the same job again? If you could, I will give you $200 from the next crop, because your words had more effect than twenty-five tons of fertilizer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of the fact that preachers and priests are having a hard time to make ends meet, and if their words have such “nitrogenous” powers that they can fertilize the ground, what is the use of putting tons and tons of manure on the ground in order to grow good crops? It would be a simple matter to have clergymen do the job and charge so much per acre therefor. I am sure they would not charge much just to say a few curses annually. It would be a great saving to the poor farmers who are undergoing this terrible time of depression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Possibly a letter could be sent to Mr. Ratti, "who is the head of the clergy outfit, and suggest to him that instructions be given the bishops, archbishops, cardinals and priests to start this new job of fertilizing the entire country and thereby do their share in bringing back the lost prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reason I am sending this to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> is that heretofore this publication has always mentioned the blessings of the clergy that ended in catastrophes to those blessed. We have enjoyed every number of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font10"> but I would like to see you be fair to the clergy of “Christendom” and not only mention the blessings and the resulting catastrophes thereof, but also the blessed effect their curses have upon the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By the way, while we are on the subject of fertilization, I would like to call your attention to the words of God’s prophet Jeremiah in the twenty-fifth chapter and thirty-third verse. This describes the final battle impending. The prophet says: “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” This is Jehovah’s program of world-wide fertilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the same chapter and thirty-fourth verse we are shown the material to be used for the purpose of fertilization, that is, the “shepherds”, or pastors, meaning the religious teachers of “organized Christianity” and the principal of the flock, meaning those mighty men of finance and politics who join the church and run the same for their own self-aggrandizement. Their bodies will be used for the purpose of enriching the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then, the prophet continues: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Religious, political and financial deceivers being cleared out of the way, the people of good will shall grow up like “calves of the stall”. Then they shall build houses and inhabit them, and plant trees and eat the fruit of them. There will be no oppressors to molest them, and all those who love Jehovah God shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">&quot;Woodsworth, of Winnipeg, started something when he formally proposed in parliament that “the government should immediately take measures looking to the setting up of a cooperative commonwealth in which all natural resources and the socially necessary machinery of production will he used in the interests of the people and not for the benefit of the few<sup>-</sup>’. There was opposition, of course, but the organization of the commonwealth proceeds and its organizers explain:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We do not stand for a division of property, but the public ownership of certain kinds of property. We do publicly own the streets, highways, schools, post office system, and in some places the electric light and water systems. We have not divided the post office, neither could we if we wanted to. We could not divide what is called the machinery of production and distribution, such as the shops, factories, mines and railroads. These industries are not operated by private individuals now, but by groups of capitalists. The Cooperative Commonwealth Federation proposes to transfer the title of property now operated by the financiers to the people of Canada. The only thing we have ever thought of dividing is the chance to work in the great public enterprises which under Cooperative Commonwealth Federation will be open to both men and women. In other words, we propose to divide the jobs, give everyone a chance to work, and make it so that ‘he who will not work shall not eat’. More than 80 percent of the working people live in rented houses. Their private possessions are few and almost worthless. Their wages are all used up in cost of living, leaving no chance to collect private property. The capitalists sooner or later get the wealth created by labor. When the ownership of the industries on which profits are filched from labor passes to the people, then the useful workers will get, not only what they now receive, but also that part of their earnings which go to the private owners as profit. It will then be possible for the working people to own their own homes and such other property as is needed for private use. The home under capitalism is assailed by terrible enemies, such as poverty, disease and ignorance. These are home-breakers, every one of which has an economic cause for existence. It has been said that the plan will not work. My dear doubting Thomas, your father said that about every piece of machinery ever invented. He said of the first railroad that the noise of the engine would dry up the cows and scare the chickens out of the summer crop of eggs. Of the first steamboat, that the boiler would blow up and the ship couldn’t carry enough coal to make a trip across the sea. A group of farmers stood about the first self-binder ever put on the platform of your dealer and with a knowing look they said: ‘Too much machinery, too complex, never will work.’ When the first cream separator came out they laughed at the idea of a machine getting the cream out of the milk. How our fathers laughed at the first automobile. You don't laugh at these things any more.&quot; The worst that can happen to Canada is to go on as it is.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Lead and Arsenic Poisoning</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">(From Consumers’ Research General Bulletin)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font10">OT more than a generation ago, it was extremely common to use lead piping in houses, and a great deal is still in use, not only in old plumbing but in newer installations. Since lead is so pliable and so easily managed in making connections, there is a great temptation to use short lengths of it, at least in difficult places. Lead poisoning in certain circumstances may come from a very few feet of lead pipe. All natural waters have some solvent power for lead, and the cleaner the water supply, probably the greater is the danger on this head. Even when the water is such that it has no tendency to dissolve lead, certain circumstances may arise, such as electrolysis in the piping arrangements, or changes in the character of the water, that may lead to lead poisoning. Lead pipes have even been put in soda fountains (soda syphon bottles frequently have lead valves or tubes), although lead in contact with carbonated or gassy water is particularly hazardous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The extremely small surface of metal which needs to be exposed to the solvent action of a large volume of water to cause lead poisoning is well illustrated in several cases of poisoning cited by Dr. Rosenau: one where only 12 feet of the service pipe in a cistern was of lead; and another of a woman of advanced years contracting lead poisoning from a well contaminated by </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">an old lead clock-weight</span><span class="font10"> which had fallen in. In this case it was 14 months after the occurrence before symptoms appeared. Improvement was noted within two weeks after the weight was found and removed, and complete recovery took place in four months. In another case involving 10 feet of lead pipe in a cistern, the recovery was only partial after two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The amount of lead sufficient to constitute a definite danger to health is far too small, of course, to be detected by the senses or in any other way than by delicate tests which can be successfully applied only by skilled chemists. One part of lead in two million parts of water has done serious injury to health. The maximum allowable limit tolerated in any water supply should probably be not more than one part in ten million. No one should drink or cook with water from a system containing lead piping except after running off sufficient water to account for all that which has been standing in the pipes, especially after any considerable period during which water has not been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The common use of storage batteries with radio sets and in automobiles has introduced a new and extremely dangerous source of potential lead poisoning. Most of those who handle such batteries in cleaning the terminals or making connections with wiring, are unaware that they are dealing with one of the most deadly poisons with which they are ever likely to come into contact. The dangers are especially great where such batteries are used in the house, and the deadly lead salts from the outside and from the terminals of the battery may readily be transferred by some accident of cleaning, wiping, or handling, to an article or appliance used in connection with the food or drink consumed in the household.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Babies have frequently been killed by chewing at the lead paint on their cribs, on other furniture, or on toys. Even bullets carried for a time in the pocket have deposited sufficient lead on the skin, later to be transferred to the mouth with food or drink, to cause lead poisoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most people are probably unaware of the risks of arsenic and lead poisoning they incur in eating fresh fruit such as pears and apples without first peeling them. Two compounds of arsenic are in common use for poisoning of insects, and one of those—lead arsenate—has come into enormous consumption as an agricultural insecticide. For this purpose it is used mixed with water, as a spray; or as a dry powder blown or dusted upon the infested plants or trees. Enormous quantities of this substance are sold, estimated to be about % pound per capita per annum, of which certainly a sensible proportion comes back to nearly every consumer of fruit and vegetable products when he purchases his market supplies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Fasting Scientifically </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. La June Foster (California)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font10">OTHING helps more in the matter of getting the system thoroughly cleansed than a long fast or a series of short fasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Much has been said for and against fasting. Much has been called fasting that is certainly an injury to the thing it appears to represent. Many people attempt to fast without the first knowledge as to the necessary principles. It is like many other privileges: it can be misused. That much for fasting when wrongly conducted (many people fast before the body is prepared with a proper eliminative diet). I find it is not the fasting that usually does the harm, but the manner in which the person returns to eating. That is even more important than the fast itself. During the fast the body is doing little but eliminating; it is not burdened with the matter of digestion, etc. But when the fast is over and the return to food is made, a great many mistakes can be made, especially the mistake of overeating. Naturally the appetite is very keen, after so good a rest from indulgence, and it often still calls for things that are not good for the body (that is, unless the process of elimination has been very complete). The force of habit of years is difficult to overcome, so great judgment must be exercised to see that the proper foods are taken in the proper amounts at the proper intervals, so that not all that is gained by the fast will be lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A fast, properly conducted, will gain more for the average case than months, and sometimes oven years, of carefully regulated eating (without the fast to precede it). It will add so much to mental force. It will increase vitality and resistance to disease. It will give great energy and spiritual powers. Fasting has been long recognized by advanced scientists as the quickest means of elimination of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the best types of fasts is the acid fruit juice fast, using the juice of oranges, grapefruit or lemons; for instance, the juice of one or two oranges taken with a glass of water (preferably distilled). Begin the regime at eight or nine in the forenoon, and continue through six or seven periods. Grapefruit or lemon juice may be added to the orange juice to vary the taste. Tomato juice is used successfully by many instead of citrus fruits. The grape diet or grape juice fast is excellent for cleansing and building purposes, as grapes are a perfect proteid. There are also several varieties. Use water only in addition. Alternate grapes, using them as juice and whole, also eating the skins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A fast of this kind, taken from four to five days, will do much to assist Nature. The reason for continuing at least this long is that the body does not really begin to eliminate from the tissues until after the third or fourth day of fasting, in the average case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In most cases, due to the lack of solid food, the body does not have normal bowel action during the fast and it is necessary to have a daily enema or two of plain tepid (or in some cases even cold) water to assist in the elimination of waste and to prevent reabsorption of poisons from the intestines back into the system. Further instructions are given in a separate article on “Enemas”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Extended fasts or complete fasts (of only water, or even no water), can be undertaken with splendid results by almost any type of case; but must not be undertaken unless one is familiar with the rules necessary in such a procedure, or unless one is under the observation or care of someone who has had experience with these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Breaking a Fast (The steps that follow)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Following a complete fast or a limited fast proceed very carefully, as the stomach and digestive tract have undergone many changes, especially that of shrinking back to normal size. The most serious error one can commit then is to eat fermentive foods (such as starches) or to overeat even on normal foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">STEPS FOLLOWING FASTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 1. The complete fast (taking only water, or in some cases not even water, but one or two enemas of plain water daily), followed by a week or two of acid fruit juices and water, taken at intervals of two hours, from 6 or 8 a.m. to 6 or 8 p.m. (continuing the enema if necessary). The citrus fruits, such as lemon, grapefruit, or orange juice, are best to use. In some cases tomato juice is preferable, due to its lack of sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 2. Second step (milk regime) not advisable in all cases. Milk is taken at same intervals and times as stated in Step 1. Start the first day with about 1/4 of a quart of raw milk or goat’s milk (diluted). Second day, take 1 quart. Third day, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">1½</span><span class="font10"> quarts. Fourth day, 2 quarts. Fifth day, 2 quarts. Sixth day, 3 quarts. Most cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">will find that taking more than that does not agree. If more is needed, increase by adding an extra pint a day (not, however, beyond 5 or 6 quarts per day); length of regime variable. Take some acid fruit juice between or shortly before each milk feeding. Milk regime requires a great deal of rest to get the best results, though some exercise and plenty’ of fresh air and sunshine are needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 3. Careful introduction of the acid fruits themselves or the other fruits, such as pears, peaches, tomatoes, nectarines, berries, cherries, grapes, apricots, apples, plums, fresh prunes, persimmons, melons, pineapples (fresh), fresh figs and avocados (very effective, neutralizes the acid fruit for those who do not take acid well; body-building, laxative, healing, and digestible). Take one of these fruits at a meal, though avocado may be used with any of them. Fruit juices may be used in the middle of the forenoon and afternoon, early forenoon, and before retiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 4. To the fruits may now be added some of the protein foods for weight building, such as cottage cheese, more avocados, raw milk or goat’s milk, clabber milk, buttermilk, and in some cases cream or a few nuts (preferably pecans or almonds). Make breakfast only fruit, or add avocado. The noon meal, another kind of fruit (or the same kind all through the day). Add milk or cream to this meal, or nuts or cottage cheese. The third meal may be of fruit and of one of the proteins not used earlier in the day, or clabber milk or buttermilk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 5. For evening meal, addition of vegetables from non-starchy class, made in salad form, taken plain or with addition of French dressing made of olive oil and lemon juice, or a good homemade mayonnaise. Preferably, make a dressing of mashed ripe avocado and lemon juice. Breakfast, as before. Lunch, either as before (with addition of protein) or taking buttermilk or clabber milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 6. Introduction of cooked vegetables, carefully prepared so as to retain mineral elements (best steamed or baked). First meal: As before, fruit (with possible addition of protein). Second meal, or luncheon: Raw vegetable salad; if no protein is used for breakfast, can add protein. Or have a meal of buttermilk and figs (dried or fresh), or clabber. Third meal, dinner: One or two cooked non-starchy vegetables. Choose from list, as celery, spinach, asparagus, tomatoes, parsley, summer squash, string beans, sorrel, oyster plant, chicory, mustard greens (all greens), kale, mallow okra, New Guinea butter bean, vegetable marrow, zucchini, beet tops, Swiss chard, turnip tops, steamed onions, chayote, broccoli, Italian squash, celery’ root, eggplant, cauliflower, cabbage (best raw).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Step 7. Plan a fruit meal, a starch meal, and a protein meal. Refer to list of combinations and classifications of foods. Make balance of food at this stage, three-fourths chosen from the fruit and non-starchy vegetable class, remaining one-fourth from the concentrated foods (starches and proteins).</span></p>

At one time seventeen New York hospitals allowed hundreds of their patients to be inoculated with syphilis germs. The so-called “sisters of mercy” of St. Vincent’s Home allowed medical experimenters to inject tuberculin into the eyes of 151 patients under eight years of age. The discharges from their eyes were so scalding that they scarred the children's cheeks. Their hands were confined for twelve hours; this included those that died under the experiments, no doubt. Fine business. In Europe half a million children had tuberculosis cultures put into their blood. A physician who punctured twenty-nine children with lumbar punctures admits that fourteen died on the day of puncture, others the next day, and all but two within a very few days. After performing the operation forty-five times he concluded it had no therapeutic value. In a hospital for the treatment of Negro patients one doctor performed 426 of these lumbar punctures on new-born babies. In a Michigan hospital for the insane six patients were turned over as experimental material, and holes were drilled in their skulls, from which material was obtained for experiments on rabbits. Diphtheria poison has been administered in the eyes of children. A girl of four and a boy of eight were inoculated with the virus of foot-and-mouth disease. A boy was deliberately dosed with various poisons, so that their effects could be studied. At one time two thousand infants three days old were given toxin-antitoxin, which is now no longer used, having been superseded by a different toxoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Anthrax has been injected into dying children. A well-known pus firm advertised among doctors that every lot of vaccine virus was tested physiologically on children, this insuring an active and potent product. It was not stated whose children were used. It may be your children next, or, if not your children, it may be yourself, which, of course, would not make it seem nearly so bad to other people as to you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Senator Hatfield, of West Virginia, seems not to think much of the N-I-R-A program. According to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum,</span><span class="font10"> he recently wrote to Hugh S. Johnson, National Recovery administrator, quite a lengthy letter, from which we select a few paragraphs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I will patriotically cooperate with you in sending a respectful petition to the president to exercise his legislative function of repeal and abandon this ghastly folly of industrial regimentation; for such is our present state of ignominy that by a single stroke of his pen all this economic madness called N-I-R-A can be ended.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I will eagerly cooperate with you toward restraining the orgy of speculation now carried on under the absolutism of those who subscribed to, and qualified, under the N-I-R-A, and in curbing the profiteering that the makeshift N-I-R-A plans have precipitated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘‘Assuming that it is not further power that you desire, because N-I-R-A bristles with powers of every description, so that the destiny of an entire nation is now committed to the caprice of a single individual, I beg to offer this one further suggestion, namely, that the swaggering bully rarely remains very long a popular figure in our national life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘‘Surely by this time you have enough of the inner workings of the N-I-R-A to realize that it runs counter to the oldest traditions and the very spirit of America. It can never be satisfactory to a free people, and no amount of ballyhoo can make it so. Surely in your heart you must be averse to the Russianizing of America. I note that you declared your intention of resigning in November. I hope you will do so sooner, and that, when you do, you will frankly and fully inform the nation what you must know to be the truth: that N-I-R-A can never successfully manage the affairs of a free people. In that connection I will gladly cooperate with you to restore to our postage stamps the face of George Washington, which has now been blotted out and replaced by the so-called Soviet scythe.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">AYS Ralph G. Green, of Arkansas: “The ability of the people to purchase anything is decreasing, especially among the cotton farmers. A year ago a bale of cotton would purchase thirteen barrels of flour, and today a bale of cotton will get only six barrels of flour. The purchasing power of the farmers has decreased, on an average, about fifty percent. As a result of these conditions the unrest and dissatisfaction is making people willing to hear the message of hope, and it finds a response when once they hear.”</span></p>

Bean searched the dead man and found forty dollars in currency and a ‘six-shooter’ and brought in a verdict ‘death by accident’, but ‘I fine him $40 for carrying concealed weapons; because he is dead is no reason why he should not pay the fine’; and he kept the pistol and the money.</span></p>

I therefore conciliate my American friends by inviting my English ones to apply everything I say of the Americans in this book to themselves, with the assurance that they deserve it no less and. that their day of judgment may be no farther off, if so far.”</span></p>

In the Balkans there seems to be a general conviction that another world war will occur in 1935 and that the nations are now making ready for it.</span></p>

Why not buy the surplus wheat, feed it to the surplus hogs, and pass some good grain-fed bacon, instead of spoiled sow belly, out to the poor? If it really be up to the rest of us to make the cotton farmer prosperous, why not buy up his cotton, make it into breeches and let our missionaries take clothes as well as advice into benighted lands? Why spend millions of dollars fighting the boll weevil, and then spend added millions spoiling more cotton than he could spoil in the same length of time? Wouldn't it be better economy to let the boll weevil do this chore by himself? Why loan one farmer money to buy seed and then pay another farmer for refraining from planting his seed?”</span></p>

The ass withstood the madness of the money-mad prophet who had sold himself to the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The f Sign” is a pretentious monthly magazine of “Passionist Missions, Inc., Monastery Place, Union City, N. J.” In the course of a year it gives its readers 816 pages of literature, including covers, for the sum of $2. W’e give our readers 832 pages, same size, for $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Glancing over the publication, one is impressed with the thought that its emblem should be, not the sign of the cross, so freely in evidence throughout, but rather the dollar sign. The inside front cover is wholly devoted to the mass racket. You pay $.50 for a life subscription to the Passionist Society; you can pay it by installments, only so you pay. You can pay this $50 while alive or your relatives may when you're dead, only so you pay; the main thing is the pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the November issue there are two full pages on “St. Catherine's Treatise on Purgatory”. That ought to be good; it will help to keep the suckers coming. The fact that there is nothing about this doctrine in the Scriptures makes it necessary to put it up to the “saints”. Why make a saint and then not have him work ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Turning to the back of the publication, there is a half page containing a list of the easy-marks, the Hickeys, Horans, Welshs, Burkes, O'Mearas, O’Reillys, Sullivans, Murphys, Fogartys, McNamaras, O’Briens, Dolans, Hugheses, O’Neils, Fitzsimmonses, Doyles, Kanes, Dalys, Dorans, Dillons, and Reillys, whose relatives have come across with the long green. At the head of the list it says, “Restrain not Grace from the Dead.” The names do not take much space, and at $50 a shot they would count up to $5,850—not a mean haul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Who Will Die Tonight?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Turning the page, there is a half-page advertisement entitled 'Who Will Die Tonight?’’ It tells you how to make out your will to “The Treasurer of Passionist Missions, Incorporated, taking his receipt therefor” within a stipulated number of months, after your decease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then follows a half-page advertisement entitled “Painless Giving”. You send for a Mite Box or Dime Bank. You are told that you won't miss what is put in the bank, but, thoughtfully, the suggestion is added, “If you do miss it, so much the better for the cause for which you make the sacrifice.” If you miss it, you just miss it; that is all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thinking the matter over, and fearing that they have not said enough about their desire for money, the Passionist Missions, Inc., then devote two whole pages to downright begging, one of which is entitled “For Christ's Cause” and makes another effort to get your fortune at the close of life, while the last page, “Where Put Your Money?” is an attempt to get it while you live. It is best not to take any chances with those that might die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This last scheme, the Annuity Bond racket, is worthy of attention. You are invited to send in $500 upwards, upon which you receive an uncertain rate of interest as long as you live. It seems you can hand over Liberty Bonds and they will be accepted at the going market price, but if, to meet an emergency sometime, you want to cash your Annuity Bonds, purchased so easily with your Liberty Bonds, then, we are sorry, “An Annuity Bond has no market value.” “An Annuity Bond never requires reinvestment.” You said it, Mabel; it is gone for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The contents of the publication receive our notice. Here is a four-page article, by Edward S. Schwegler, entitled “The Bat in the Watch Tower”. A bat is famous for being able to see in the dark, and to make it interesting for birds gorged and supposedly safe on their perches. *Mr. Schwegler seemingly identifies Judge Rutherford as the bat. Not so bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Schwegler asks, “But who is this Judge Rutherford whose inspired statements are thus sent all over the world in millions of books and pamphlets and whose ‘lectures are now heard over 340 radio stations each week during the year’ ? About the man himself little information seems available.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A System of Man-Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The most elementary knowledge of the Roman Catholic church plainly reveals to every intelligent person that it is a system of creatureworship, man-worship, and not a system of worshiping the great and true and only Jehovah God, the God of the Bible. All one has to do is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">*Schwegler, by the way, is the “Rev.” E.S.S., “D.D.,” assistant pastor, St. John the Evangelist Church, Buffalo, N. Y. His official identity is adroitly obscured, however, in the magazine article. Sons of “that old serpent” act thus natiually. </span><span class="font10">to compare the words and deeds of the “popes” with those of Jesus, the Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Workmen about the Vatican are taught that it is a great favor to kiss the hand of the ‘pope’. Did Jesus ever ask anybody to kiss His hand? All orders must be accepted on bended knee. Did Jesus leave any record of such obeisance with respect to himself?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ‘pope’s’ court is the greatest stickler for uniforms and colors imaginable. Black knee breeches, medieval ruffs, purple robes, scarlet robes, gold robes, white robes, white silk canopies, ostrich-feather fans, cream-colored copes with gold and silver trimmings, white ermine capes, trumpets, thousands of flickering candles, serpentine swords, breastplates, gold chains, gold crosses, exquisite laces, silk caps, velvet slippers, robes gleaming with precious stones, solid silver furniture, priceless paintings ; what does it all mean ? Is there anything whatever in the life of Christ to indicate that He approved or made use of such paraphernalia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The thing that determines whether a man is a true servant and worshiper of Jehovah God is not the clothing he wears, or the setting in which he wears it, but his reverence for God’s Word. Every ‘pope’ that ever lived, if he had any knowledge of the Scriptures at all, knew, and must have known, that there is nothing in the Lord’s Word that remotely, in any sense of the word, justifies the existence of such an institution as functions from Vatican City. Every teaching of the Roman Catholic church is fundamentally out of accord with the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If those that direct the activities of the Roman Catholic church were true to God they would pay diligent attention when some man, like Judge Rutherford, modest, reverent, thorough, persistent, seeks to draw the attention of men to the plain teaching of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nathanael Had Better Sense</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;When Philip first came to Nathanael, saying, ‘We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph,” Nathanael at first replied, “Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ?” but when Philip asked him to come and see, and he came and did see, he became one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Philip could have retorted to Nathanael, ‘Who are you. Nathanael? you do not amount to so much&quot;; and so we could now retort to Edward S. Schwegler, “Who are you, Schwegler? we never even heard of you before”; but that would be quite beside the mark. The best way is to invite them to come and see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Schwegler and his friends have been so busy glorifying men that when somebody comes along who invites the attention of the people to Jehovah God and His Word of truth, they do not know where to place him or what to do with him. In his very first paragraph Schwegler, in duty bound, mentions the ‘pope’; in the second he has some more about ‘the holy father’, and in the third, having clearly revealed himself as a man-worshiper, he says consistently, “Put Rutherford off the air.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There you have the true bigot, and having proved himself a bigot, Mr. Schwegler next proceeds to define bigotry. A bigot, to a Roman Catholic, is any person who is not a Roman Catholic, and who has the hardihood to express himself. A Roman Catholic may teach anything he pleases, and in any way he pleases; such is not bigotry. But the moment any person says something, no matter how Scriptural, no matter how true, if it reflects in any manner upon the stream of effluvia that goes forth from Rome, and which has sickened Spain and Mexico even unto death, then that is bigotry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In his article Schwegler quotes quite liberally from Judge Rutherford’s writings. It is well. In that manner some truth gets to the readers of the paper which its publishers designate as “The t Sign” but which, with keener discernment of the issues involved, we prefer to denominate as “The $ Sign”. The concluding paragraph is typical of the Roman Catholic bigot, who wishes to silence every voice but his own. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And so to our original demand: ‘Put Rutherford off the air!’ Let this nocturnal vampire with his hideous mask of bigotry keep hanging head down amid the dust and cobwebs of his Watch Tower. There is no place for him in the fresh air of religious freedom and the pure sunshine of American tolerance. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10"> DISPATCH from Vatican City says that in some manner 450 unemployed from Britain came there on a pilgrimage. The “pope” blamed their hard luck, not on the stupidity and selfishness of man, where it belongs, but said to them by way of comfort, “If divine providence caused you to be deprived of work, he did it for your own good.” We have heard Almighty God accused of many things, but this is the first time we ever heard Him accused of trying to keep a poor man from getting employment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Did the Pope Ever “Bless” the Navy Before?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">E NOTICE that the “pope” has just blessed the American navy. Not sure if a thing like this works forward or backward or in both directions. Some years back we had several terrible submarine accidents, and later a whole string of torpedo boat destroyers was run on the rocks off California as fast as they could get to them. We never did know why the navy had that fleet of boats run on the rocks, but if the “pope” had ever “blessed” them then they just could not be blamed for what happened.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10">S IS well known, the 'pope’ is dead set against the separation of church and state, and has issued many bulls to that effect, but the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic News,</span><span class="font10"> speaking about France, is honest enough to admit: “It has been shown that disestablishment in that country has not hurt the church. Instead, separation of church and state in France has infused the church with more vigor, given it more of the spirit of piety and sacrifice. Disestablishment has been in force in France for more than a quarter of a century.” Wait till the ‘pope’ hears about this.</span></p>

It has recently been to the Holy Land. On its return Pope Pius NI “blessed&quot; it in the Vatican and gave to it a very beautiful necklace of amethysts. Just what the statue will do with the blessing, we do not know, but would be willing to bet she doesn’t keep the amethysts, in these hard times, when the ten-cent stores sell good beads so dirt-cheap. The statue is known as “The Living Virgin”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">C</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ardinal Wiseman, English prelate of the Roman Catholic church, in his “Lectures on the Principal Doctrines and Practices of the Roman Catholic Church”, once said: “Several individuals have abandoned the Roman Catholic church, and become members of some Protestant communion. The history in every case is simply this, that the individual—by some chance or other, probably through the ministry of some pious person—became possessed of the Word of God, of the Bible; that he perused this Book; that he could not find in it transubstantiation or auricular confession; that he could not discover in it one word of purgatory or of worshiping of images.”</span></p>

A single one of these priests invested his little nest egg of $70,000 and is believed to have lost it all. He will now be able to preach fervently from the text, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, . . . where thieves break through and steal.” It is hard enough to get the money away from the servant girls and day laborers, in the first place, without having to lose it and then have to go after it all over again.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">IN  </span><span class="font10">SOME way 450 of Britain’s unemployed managed to get to Vatican City to greet the “pope”. On arrival they were told by Ambrose that if God had caused them to be deprived of work, He had done it for their own good. Probably the thing that led him into this break is the reflection that there are tens of thousands of clergy throughout the world that are worse than useless, and yet, as they are fat, well fed, well wined, and well clothed, anybody ought to be able to see that some kind of god has been looking after them. The only regrettable thing about Ambrose’s statements on a subject of this kind is that the only god he knows anything about is the wrong one, the mimic one, the one mentioned by the apostle in 2 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">WOMAN in Atlantic City brought suit for $75,000 against an undertaker because he embalmed her husband's body thirty minutes after a death by heart disease instead of waiting sixty minutes. The ground of the complaint is that “conditional absolution may be given by a priest within an hour after apparent death, but could not be given after embalming, which removed the possibility of remaining life”. Now if anybody can think of a more perfect piece of bunk than that, please write it up and send it in. When a man is dead he is all through, and nobody, no matter how he wears his collar, or if he has a cross on his back or not, can do one solitary thing for him. Unless Almighty God raises him from the dead, nobody can ever do a thing for him from that time forth to all eternity. The undertakers should not be compelled to give up one cent to the frauds that have convinced this poor widow that they could have, conditionally or unconditionally, done one thing for this poor man that dropped dead of heart disease on the Atlantic City beach.</span></p>

He first got a letter from Cardinal Daugherty, for which letter of introduction he was to have paid $5,000, but there is no evidence that the $5,000 was ever paid. This was all wrong, and so the cardinal was stung, too. It will teach him to be more careful. Well, the racketeer worked among newly appointed pastors. He went to them in turn and asserted that he had contracted with their predecessors to renovate the church’s lightning-rod system. Usually, two workmen appeared with him; they collected $500 up for their work. Finally he got caught and was sentenced to two years in Moya-mensing prison for working what the judge on the bench described as “a bold and deliberate swindle”. Shame on him!</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">T IS only the decent thing, after all that Mother did for you, for you to help her out of the bonfire where, so it seems, she has had the bad luck to land. The Society of the Divine Word, St. Paul’s Mission House, Epworth, Iowa, tells us about it. In a circular letter they say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Perhaps your dear mother now suffering in the flames of Purgatory may now be badly needing your help. Your good father who spent year after year of his life providing for you may now be calling to you for aid from the next world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It sort of makes you feel good to know that Dad is there with Mother, in that place where the proprietor has such a mean disposition. He would do what he could to help her. Dad was always like that. He never could see even a poor bird with a broken wing but he wanted to fix it, somehow. So Dad is there with Mother, standing between her and the hottest part of the brimstone, doing what he can to fan away some of the flames, and telling her to keep a brave heart, and they will surely get out sometime. They had many tough breaks in life, but they always got out of every jam, and some time or another they would get away from this mean cuss that was taking all the joy out of life. The real boss is absent; only priests are visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Purgatory slip enclosed with the letter is in mourning. It ought to be. It has a big black band around the outside and starts off like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“For the Poor Souls. Come to their assistance, Ye Saints of God! Meet them, Ye angels of the Lord. Receive their souls and present them to the Most High.” Then, to show where they got the authority for saying all this, there follow parenthetically the words “(From the Burial Service.)”. Don’t ask who got up the Burial Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It intimates that the Society of the Divine Word, Epworth, Iowa, is in cahoots with the gang that is running this vicious place, for there is a place on the blank where you can send them so many dollars. Just how these dollars are conveyed to Dad, and how he can make use of them for installing a mechanical cooling apparatus so that Ma can at least get a little relief occasionally by retiring into the icebox, is left unexplained.

<p><span class="font10">EFERRING to the exhumation of the mummy of Mother Cabrini, and its subsequent entombment in the Mother Cabrini Memorial High School, New York, a National Catholic Welfare Council dispatch from New York says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“There was nothing sombre about the entombment ceremony at the high school. It was an occasion of joy, for the sisters and their students and friends looked upon the event as the arrival of a saint who is to make her permanent earthly home among them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the benefit of any who may not understand this expression about Mother Cabrini’s “permanent earthly home” we explain its Egyptian origin. Among the ancient Egyptians, besides the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">body,</span><span class="font10"> the soul (Ba) and the divine spark (the Khu), there was also a sort of spiritual body (Ka), corresponding to the real body. The Ka of a woman was thought of as a woman; after death it remained with the mummy in the tomb. Actually, of course, there is no Ba, Khu or Ka. All that remains of Mother Cabrini is her body, her mummy. She is dead, and unless God raises her from the dead she will remain forever as if she had never been. All that remains in the Mother Cabrini Memorial High School are a few pounds of earth that might better be cremated or allowed to moulder into dust. It is unsanitary and gruesome to have corpses around high schools, but the Roman Catholic sisters like that kind of thing, and if that is the thing they like, then they have what they like.</span></p>

It was not preached until 630 B.C., when it was espoused by Zarathustra”. Is that so? Well, David, the writer of the Psalms, the ‘little Bible’, died in 1039 B.C., and he said, “I have walked in thy truth” (Psalm 26:3); and “I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation”. (Psalm 40:10) In view of the fact that Jesus Christ expressly states that David was an inspired prophet of the Lord (Matthew 22:43), and in view of the further fact that neither He nor any of the apostles or prophets mentioned Zarathustra (Zoroaster) in any way, won’t Reverend Guthrie kindly tell us whether he is doing just right to take people’s money under the claim that he is a Christian minister? Why not discard all pretense of being a follower of Jesus and do the manly thing: come out openly as a follower of Zoroaster?</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10"> FOLLOWER of Christ is one who believes that God through Christ has provided salvation for mankind. The clergymen as a general rule do not believe that. They pose before the people as preachers, and yet they are diligent in keeping the people away from the Bible. They are daily becoming bolder in denying the Bible; and instead of referring the people to the remedy God has provided, they are telling the people that big business and the politicians and they themselves are their guardians and saviors. The majority of these clergymen call themselves “modernists<sup>-</sup>’. That means that they deny the Bible account of creation, and the fall of man, and the redemption through Christ Jesus’ sacrifice. The scheme is to turn the minds of the people away from the Bible and away from God, and turn them to the worship of men or other creatures. Why is this true ?’ you may ask. Briefly, the reason is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God created the first man perfect and placed him in Eden, the garden of the Lord. God made Lucifer, one of His great angelic creatures, overseer or overlord of man. Lucifer was ambitious to have men worship him; and to accomplish his purposes he induced man to violate God’s law. The penalty for that wrongful act was death. God sentenced the first man, Adam, to death and expelled him from Eden. Read this in the third chapter of the book of Genesis. Because of this wrongful act, all of Adam’s children were begotten in sin and born in iniquity. (Psalm 51: 5) Since then, men have been dying, and would remain dead for ever unless God in the exercise of His loving-kindness makes provision for man’s redemption and blessing. Long ago God promised to provide redemption. He promised that He would redeem mankind and then establish on earth a government of righteousness for the blessing of all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the time that Adam was expelled from Eden God changed the name of Lucifer to that of Satan the Devil. “Satan&quot; means </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">opposer; </span><span class="font10">and ever since then he has been opposing God. Satan has employed numerous schemes to turn the people away from Jehovah. God could have prevented him from so doing; but the Bible shows that it is God’s purpose to let Satan the Devil go the limit in the commission of wickedness and in his effort to turn all creation, human and spiritual, away from God and then to intervene and demonstrate to all creation that Jehovah God is the true God and is supreme and all-powerful and thus vindicate His word and His name. In the meantime mankind has been suffering great adversity at the hands of the Devil and his agents, but then, after the vindication of God’s word and name, Jehovah God will show to mankind the privilege of obeying righteousness and of receiving great blessings that He has in store for man. God selected the nation of Israel to make of them a model nation and to teach them and through them the way leading to life and happiness. That people had their religious services; and the Devil turned the clergymen of Israel away from God, so that when Jesus came these men claimed to represent God but in fact represented the Devil and deceived the people. To them Jesus said: “If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” —John 8:42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a true Christianity, and there is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">false, so-called “Christianity”. This organization, so-called “Christianity”, is also called “Christendom”. True followers of Christ believe the truth and delight to tell God’s truth to others. False or so-called “Christians” yield to the influence of Satan, deceive many, and lead the people away from God. Numerous instances of this kind could be cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You will admit that Bishop Gore and Bishop Barnes, two of the most distinguished clergymen of England, are good samples of what the clergymen are doing. In the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font10"> of September 19, 1927, appears a speech made by Bishop Gore at Grosvenor Chapel, Mayfair, London. He denied the credibility of the Bible and said of the writers of the Bible that “they are masters of story-telling”. Here are some of his words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We are nourishing a vain hope if we suppose that the early chapters of Genesis or the stories about Daniel and Enoch are ever going to be accepted as history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘‘They have none of the characteristics of history as real science has learned to detect them, and it is no good kicking against facts. We will merely delay</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the necessary adjustment of Christianity to the new world of ideas by going on murmuring, and perplexing the minds of our children, instead of being perfectly frank with our own minds and with others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Westminster Gazette,</span><span class="font10"> of London, on Monday, September </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">26,</span><span class="font10">1927, reports the speech of the Reverend Doctor Barnes, bishop of Birmingham, England. This is what he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In this age of social and moral confusion, of intellectual progress and unrest, the turmoil was so great that few landmarks seemed safe, and the religious beliefs and traditions of our forefathers were sharply challenged,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Were they to cling to the old faith? He would rather say: “Welcome new discoveries with an open mind and reverence the great men who made them. But let them remember that, behind all the new knowledge, the fundamental issues of life would remain veiled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Today,” he continued, “there is, among competent men of science, unanimous agreement that man has been evolved from an ape-like stock. He arose, possibly a million years ago, from a tangle of apes which began to vary in different directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“As a result the stories of the creation of Adam and Eve, of their primal innocence and of their fall, have become for us folklore. But by the men who built up Catholic theology they were accepted as solid fact. Man’s special creation was one of the primary assumptions of the Catholic system. In it the fall explained the sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Darwin’s triumph has destroyed the whole theological scheme. Man is not a being who has fallen from an ideal state of perfect innocence: he is an animal slowly gaining spiritual understanding and, with the gain, rising far above his distant ancestors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In America the major portion of the clergymen hold exactly the same views as expressed by the two bishops above mentioned. Such men are not safe advisers of the people. They are the counterparts of the Jewish Pharisees. They have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof, even as the apostle Paul said they would.—2 Timothy 3:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The clergy as a class claim to be followers of Jesus Christ, and make the people believe that they are. The Scriptures designate Jesus Christ as “The Prince of Peace”. When He was on earth He repeatedly declared the law which His followers must obey: “Thou shalt not kill.” Anyone who is a true follower of Jesus Christ must be obedient to this command. Anyone claiming to be a follower of Christ and who at the same time urges men to kill each other is a hypocrite and party to the crime of the killing. There might be some excuse or extenuating circumstances for men who know nothing about the Bible to engage in war, but there is no excuse or extenuating circumstance in favor of Christ’s followers’ voluntarily engaging in war or urging others to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the world war of 1914 to 1918 the clergymen advocated war, urged young men to go to war to kill their fellow men, used their church buildings for recruiting stations, and denounced and persecuted everyone who expressed conscientious scruples against killing. Everybody knows this statement to be true. They went even further than that. Many of the clergymen told young men that if they would go to war and die upon the battlefield, their blood would be counted in with that of Jesus and their souls would immediately be winged off to glory. They should have known better; because war is murder and no murderer has eternal life. So say the sacred Scriptures. (1 John 3:15) If these men, contrary to the Word of the Lord, advocate the killing of their fellow men and at the same time claim to be followers of Christ, they are both hypocrites and unsafe advisers of the people. The evidence is too voluminous to cite all of it; but here you have some, naming the clergymen who are guilty of duplicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was never any danger of Germany’s invading America. Every sensible man knew that that was impossible. And yet some of the most zealous advocates of America’s entering the war were the clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Reverend S. Parkes Cadman, an Englishman who resides in America and who is expresident of the organization called the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, just before the war and while answering questions before the Bedford branch of the Y.M.C.A. in Brooklyn passionately exclaimed: “Prepare! Prepare ! Prepare for war!” When he was asked his opinion of students who refused to engage in military training he replied: “They are parasites, suckers, and rubbish. The teacher that teaches them they have no right to bear arms for the state should be fired out of his position.” Doctor Cadman, with others, boasted of the fighting rector Doctor Reiland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Massachusetts Clerical Association was one of the first to vote for America to enter the war, and a delegation of the prominent clergy visited Washington to combat the “unchristian influence” of pacifists. They made it their business to use their church buildings for the preaching of war sermons. When the government enacted the conscription law and inserted a section making it possible for a Christian to decline active military service, nearly every clergyman in the land opposed those who tool: advantage of this provision of the law. They spoke of such men as ‘‘poor pussy-foot pacifists”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Doctor S. E. Young, of the Presbyterian church, called them cowards and traitors because they expressed their belief in God and in Christ and insisted on obeying God rather than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bishop Kinsolving, of Texas, declared that “such men should be driven not only from the country, but from the earth&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Reverend Howard Ganster, of Waukegan, Ill., “advocated the organization of a society for the committing of murder of persons who do not stand up or who leave the building when the 'Star Spangled Banner’ is played.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Henry Van Dyke delivered a so-called “sermon”, and referring to a gentleman who was candidate for mayor in New York, and who was against America’s entering the war, said: “I would hang every one, whether or not he be a candidate for mayor, who lifts his voice against America’s entering the war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend Gillis, a Catholic, said: “Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace, but Pontius Pilate was the Prince of Pacifists.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bishop Cooke advocated that those who desire to take advantage of the law for noncombatant service should “be deprived ... of all political and social and civil rights”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Doctor Eaton was made chairman of the National Service Section of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, and performed the duty of delivering fight-talks in the shipyards. He said: “When a spy comes sneaking around with a bomb don't say, ‘Let us pray,’ but take him out there on the marsh and tie him down and place the bomb on his chest. Light it and stand off and watch him blow to his kaiser, to hell! Be regular he-men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Evidently Eaton’s conscience hurt him so much after the war that he got himself elected to Congress from New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Reverend AV. W. Bustard, John D. Rockefeller's loyal servant, from his pulpit exclaimed: “To hell with the kaiser!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of such an array of facts, can any right-minded person do otherwise than agree that “Christendom’s” religious leaders are not followers of Christ but are blind leaders of the blind? Can they be relied upon to-lead the people in the way that guides to sure prosperity?</span></p>
