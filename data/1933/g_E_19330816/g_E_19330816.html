<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Lecturing in Front of Machine Guns</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">H</span><span class="font8">AVING no honest employment to occupy their time, the priests of the Roman Catholic church are busily engaged in the destruction of all that goes to make up American life. Their aim is to produce another Spain or Mexico, where their “church” can be supreme, and nothing that criticizes it will be allowed to survive. They do not stop at instigating murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are sure that there are some true Americans whose hearts will burn with indignation when they learn of what is going on at Plain-field, and of the latest outrage, where at a peaceable Christian meeting Judge Rutherford was surrounded on every side by police officers, detectives, plain clothes men and thugs armed with machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, automatic revolvers and like implements of war, all no doubt waiting for an agreed-upon signal to take his life. That is what happened July 30, 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those who read our issue of July 19 are familiar with what happened June 4 at Plainfield, when fifty-six men and women were arrested and thrown into prison for preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. They know that its chief of police is responsible for thrusting twenty-nine women into three cells, each intended for the accommodation of one prisoner. Only twelve could sit down throughout the night; the other seventeen were forced to stand, or to lie down on the bare concrete, between the feet of those that stood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though the night was suffocatingly hot, not so much as a drink of water was extended to these suffering women. We invite the American people to consider what would have been the outcome if twenty-nine Roman Catholic nuns had been thus treated in an American city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trial which followed the first night in prison was as brutal as the imprisonment itself. Details of this have been published in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font8"> The priests back of these outrages, and the men that committed the outrages, are not fit to live. They are enemies of Jehovah, the true and living God, and the Scriptures say of such, “For, lo, thine enemies, O [Jehovah], for, lo, thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.”—Psalm 92: 9.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Lecture Announced for Plainfield</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">Before his return from Europe Judge Rutherford announced that on July 30, at the Strand theater, at Plainfield, a religious meeting would be held for the benefit of the people of the city, at which the question would be answered, “Religious Intolerance: Why Practiced Now.” This address we are delighted to present in full to our readers, in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The police, as such, were not invited to attend this lecture. They were welcome as citizens, the same as any other citizens, but there was no need for them to be present in their official capacity. As it was, they swarmed all over the place. The huge guns in every doorway made the place look like an arsenal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same sinister influences that operated to cause the arrests on June 4 resulted in seventeen more arrests on July 29. The local press refused to carry an advertisement of the meeting, so handbills were taken around to the homes inviting the people to attend, and those arrested were accused of this “crime” of extending the invitations in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among those locked up on July 29 was a man, formerly a Roman Catholic, who first heard of the truth when those arrested on June 4 were brought into prison. After becoming convinced, as a result of several conversations, that it really is the truth, he said, “If I ever get into prison again, it will be as one of Jehovah’s witnesses”; and it came true. Thus quickly, in these days, does the division between the sheep and goats take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After these second arrests occurred, sixty automobiles traversed the streets of Plainfield and Summit, Saturday afternoon and evening, and Sunday forenoon, each bearing huge banners on either side inviting the people to come and hear Judge Rutherford free at the Strand theater. No two of these cars were adjacent to each other; there was no parade; it was bettor than a parade. By three o’clock every scat in the theater was filled and some were standing. The capacity of the theater is 1,800. It was apparent that it was an audience of exceptionally intelligent, thoughtful people.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Strand Theater an Arsenal</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">Long before the hour for calling the meeting to order, the police, though not invited to do so, came in and took it upon themselves to brandish weapons in every corner of the theater. Two machine guns behind him could have killed Judge Rutherford instantly and turned the place into a shambles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Officers bristling with weapons were at every exit and all over the house. It was reported that more than half of the total police force of sixty-four were in the theater, either in uniform or as plain clothes men. Judge Rutherford, serious but gentle, looked like a sheep in the midst of wolves. The show of weapons looked very much out of place, and was out of place. They would not have done it in a Catholic church, nor even in a Protestant one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not an untoward incident of any kind occurred, and Jehovah's witnesses knew full well there would not. Judge Rutherford was at his best. His clear, kindly voice could be heard in the remotest corner of the gallery. The speech was broadcast over WBBR, WODA and WCAU, and thus covered all of New Jersey and several adjacent states. It was a grand witness for the truth, and a telling rebuke of bigotry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A feature of the address which was exceptionally clear, and in manifest course of fulfilment that very day, was the division of the sheep and goats now actually taking place in Plainfield. ►Some of the good people of that city are lining up on. the side of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After the lecture one of the officers, who is evidently a good man, said he was not in sympathy with the abuses and injustices that have boon leveled against Jehovah’s witnesses, and had gone along and done as he was bidden to do only for fear of losing his job if he refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people that heard Judge Rutherford’s address liked it. Over and over again they punctuated it with applause. As one listened to it he could hardly refrain from asking himself the question of why the rulers should “take counsel together against [Jehovah]” (Psalm 2:2) and by their acts embarrass the innocent and peaceable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The display of automatic pistols and other artillery so conspicuously in evidence at the Strand theater reminds one of Jesus’ inquiry, “Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves for to take me?” (Matthew 26:55) But no one was taken this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The patrol wagon was waiting at the door while the lecture was going on, but there was no need for it; it went away empty. The day had a happy ending. Nevertheless, on Judge Rutherford’s account and on account of others of Jehovah’s witnesses, and of the American people as a whole, we take this occasion to protest vigorously against this unwarranted and illegal intrusion of armed men into a religious meeting. We lay this directly to the priests and believe they sought to use the “strong-arm squad” under their control to do away with a man whom they have come to hate and fear because he tells the people the truth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Some Messages of Encouragement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font7">UST before the erisis at Plainfield, the Seattle company workers, by their director, sent Judge Rutherford the following encouraging message:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘■Workers here gathered today after field service voted to send you a message expressing continued loyalty and heart sympathy, and assuring you of their prayers in your behalf for the task Jehovah has assigned to you for next Sunday at Plainfield.” H. G. B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the lecture was delivered, the following messages were received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hazleton, Pa. “Lecture clear-cut. More power to message. Jehovah be praised.” A. K. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Baltimore, Md. “Your Plainfield speech heard in Baltimore perfectly. Praise Jehovah for such courageous words.” C. F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hollis, N. Y. “About seventy people listened in at Masonic Temple, Brooklyn, to Brother Rutherford's wonderful lecture broadcast through WBBR from Plainfield, New Jersey. We all join in congratulating him and look forward with utmost joy to overthrow of Satan’s organization and full establishment of Jehovah’s kingdom on earth. Your fellow witnesses, Brooklyn company of Jehovah’s witness</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">es.” T. M. B.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Religious Intolerance: Why</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Personally delivered at Plainfield, N. J., and simultaneously broadcast, by Judge Rutherford, Sunday, July 30, 1933</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HIS SPEECH is not made for the purpose of holding up to ridicule or denouncing men for their misconduct and wickedness, even though there are those in this community who justly deserve much castigation. Jehovah God will inflict punishment in His due time. My work is that of one of His witnesses to tell the facts. We have reached the time of greatest crisis in the history of man, and it is of vital importance that everyone know the facts and the reason for the existence of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This speech is not made for the unfaithful clergy, nor for their blind dupes who attempt to hide behind the law and shield themselves in the performance of their wrongful acts. It is made for the benefit of the people who desire righteousness and fair-dealing and who are anxious to follow<sup>7</sup> out that course. Men claiming to be law-abiding citizens of New Jersey have tried to prevent the holding of this meeting and to thereby prevent you from hearing the truth. Even the chief of police of this city has asked the owner of this theater to cancel his contract for the use thereof on this occasion, and that after the full rental price had been paid. The owner preferred to honorably stand by his contract rather than to yield to sinister influence. I ask you to calmly and dispassionately follow my speech to the end, and I hope that you may receive benefit therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is necessary for me to briefly refer to certain events that have recently come to pass in this vicinity. A few weeks ago in the city of Plainfield more than fifty good citizens, and known to the officials to be harmless, were arrested without warrant or cause and thrown into prison. Twenty-nine of these prisoners were good, honest and faithful women. At the time the weather was exceedingly hot and yet these twenty-nine women were crowded into three small cells, each made for one person, and most of them compelled to stand up all night. The next morning they were fingerprinted as though they were desperate criminals. In gross violation of the fundamental law of the land, and in utter disregard of the rights of other persons, those arrested were then brought before the so-called “court”, unlawfully compelled to testify against themselves, prevented from making their own defense, and were summarily convicted in the absence of law or evidence and immediately incarcerated in prison. Their only offense was going from house to house on Sunday and preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, for the aid and comfort of the people. A more complete statement of the facts and proceedings of that mock trial is set forth in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font8">magazine under date of July 19, 1933, a copy of which magazine you may have only for the asking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I quote the words of the magistrate before whom this farce trial was had in which he referred to the ordinance which he claims had been broken, to wit: “That law is made to protect your and my family from impostors who go around and rob men.” The magistrate knew that all the defendants were Christian men and women and that they could not properly be classed as “impostors and robbers”, and in proof of this I quote further his words from the record, to wit: “I think your intentions are all right and that you are good Christian people.” If he was sincere in this latter statement his other words and conduct in connection with the case were wholly out of order. It is manifest that there w<sup>7</sup>as exercised by priests and clergymen some cruel and malicious influence which caused these inoffensive, innocent and devout Christian people, without just cause or excuse, to be incarcerated in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many good citizens of this land are asking why such outrageous things are possible in this country, where the fundamental law of the land provides that every person shall worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. In this time of greatest stress and suffering of the people these good Christian men and women, who earn their bread by daily labor, employ their days of rest, and particularly Sundays, in going from house to house to comfort and encourage the people and to point out to them that the hope of relief and blessing for mankind rests entirely upon Jehovah God’s kingdom. The real persecutors of these humble men and women are known to be prominent leaders in the religious world. The people are entitled to know why this religious intolerance is practiced in this day of enlightenment, and I shall submit to you the conclusive answer to that question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible or Holy Scriptures contains Jehovah God’s Word of truth. The clergy are compelled to admit that. Court officials lay their</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">hand upon the Bible and solemnly swear by it to tell the truth. All such are therefore precluded from gainsaying the Bible as true, and they tacitly admit that they must be bound by the teachings of the Bible. By the Bible, and it alone, I shall answer the question why religious intolerance is practiced now in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Creator of heaven and earth is the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah. The name “Jehovah” means the Eternal One and His purposes toward His creatures. There is a mimic god who opposes Jehovah God and who is man’s worst enemy, and the name of that mimic god is Satan the Devil. He is otherwise known as Serpent and Dragon. Centuries ago the Devil challenged Jehovah to place men on earth who would remain true and faithful to God under all conditions, the Devil claiming that he could turn all men away from and against Jehovah. That challenge raised the issue of Who is supreme? Jehovah could have killed the Devil immediately, but had He done so the Devil would have been denied the opportunity to make proof of his challenge and all creation would have been denied the opportunity to choose voluntarily to serve either God or the Devil. Jehovah grants to every man the privilege of exercising freely his own will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God accepted the Devil’s challenge, and fixed a time limit, during which time the Devil should have full opportunity to prove his boasted challenge. Therefore Jehovah said to the Devil, as is recorded in the Scriptures: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font8"> This means that in due time Jehovah would have His name declared in all the earth by His witnesses that the people might have the opportunity to choose as to whether they would serve Jehovah God or whether they would continue to serve the Devil. That time has now come; and that is the reason why the question for consideration today is of such great importance to you, regardless of what previous religious convictions you may have hold. It is to your interest to have the truth even though the truth proves all religions to be false. It is only by the truth that we shall be made free and learn the way to eternal life. ■—John 8: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the very beginning the Devil attempted to destroy every one who was faithful to God. He caused Abel to be murdered, and is therefore designated a “murderer from the beginning”. (John 8: 44) Early in the age of man the Devil organized religion and used it as a means of deception to turn the people away from Jehovah. In the name of religion the greatest amount of intolerance has been practiced amongst men. Intolerance is never employed by Jehovah or by His faithful servants, but it is used by and is limited entirely to Satan and to his servants. The religions which the Devil has employed to turn men away from Jehovah God appear at different times under different names, but the general Bible name therefor is Baalism. The word “Baal” is derived from the word meaning Devil; and therefore every religion, regardless of name, and which the Devil has employed to turn men away from Jehovah, is properly called Baalism. For centuries the Devil has been the invisible ruler of this world, and as such has constantly blinded men lest they learn the truth. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Long centuries ago Jehovah gave His word that in His due time He would send a righteous ruler who would rule in the stead of Satan and who would destroy the Devil and his organization and who would then give abundant blessings of peace and life to the obedient ones of the human race. God always keeps His promises, and that promise is absolutely certain to be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God organized the Jews, or Israelites, into a nation and gave them the truth. He did not do this because the Jews were naturally better than others, but because He would use them as His typical people by whom He would teach others lessons of great importance, and, especially, that if they would live they must be obedient to Jehovah God. The Jews agreed to obey Jehovah’s law, but later they yielded to the subtle and seductive influence of the Devil, and that nation, with but a few exceptions, turned away from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To His chosen people Jehovah sent His faithful prophets, whom He made His witnesses in the earth to testify His truth to the people. Because these faithful prophets testified to the truth they suffered all manner of persecution at the hands of bigots and intolerant ones in the religious organization. From the Scriptures I quote the following concerning those faithful witnesses of Jehovah, to wit: “And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets; who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions. And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afdicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise.”—Hebrews 11: 32, 33, 36-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who caused the persecution of those faithful prophets? It is obvious that Satan by and through his intolerant religious agents did so. God’s agents would not torture and persecute His own people. God permitted Satan to do his worst against those men, and at the same time afforded an opportunity to them to prove their integrity and faithfulness to God. They proved their faithfulness, sealing their testimony with their lifeblood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then Jehovah God sent to earth His great Prophet and Witness, Jesus, His beloved Son. Today big religionists, public officials and the metropolitan press speak with scorn and ridicule of men and women because they designate themselves Jehovah’s witnesses. In this connection I mention the fact that Jesus Christ was Jehovah’s great Witness, and it is man’s greatest privilege to follow in the footsteps of Jesus and to be a witness to the name of Jehovah. When on earth Jesus bore witness to the name of Jehovah. He was haled before the then great Boman ruler of Palestine, and, in answer to a question of Pilate, He said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.” ■—John 18: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus, the holy and harmless One, never did a wrong, yet was charged with every crime known to the calendar, and time and again men sought to kill Him. Finally He was arrested on the false charge of sedition and was brought before the court and His trial was had, which trial was a farce and mockery from beginning to end. The trial of the fifty witnesses of Jehovah in Plainfield a short time ago forcibly reminds one of the trial of Christ Jesus. Read, if you will, the history of that trial in the book designated </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font8"> and mark the similarity between the two. Jesus was compelled to testify against himself, even as men and women were made to bear witness against themselves in the trial recently had. In both instances such course of action was unlawful. Jesus was convicted without just cause or excuse and was put to an ignominious death, and this was done by a court made up of religionists who claimed to be servants of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus and His apostles did not build houses in which they assembled the people to preach to them, but they went from house to house, to the homes of the people, and taught them the truth, even as Jehovah’s witnesses are doing in this day. (Acts 20:20; Luke 19:5) The apostles of Jesus Christ, because they preached the gospel, were also maltreated, arrested and thrown into prison. These faithful apostles were abused by court officers and ordered to leave the community and to refrain from their work, and to them the apostles replied: “We ought to obey God rather than men,” because “we are his witnesses”. (Acts 5:29,30,32) The faithful apostles continued to bear witness to the name of Jehovah, and their maltreatment and persecution continued and they all died as martyrs, sealing their testimony with their lifeblood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Following the days of the apostles true Christianity continued to grow, and the Roman emperor Constantine, manifestly for a selfish purpose, formed a state religion and labeled it “Christianity” on earth. There is where the Papal system of Rome had its birth. Thereafter followed the most wicked inquisition and persecution of the true followers of Christ Jesus. The fires of torture were kept burning for years in the countries of Italy, Spain, France, Mexico and other places, and millions of people, by such inquisition and torture, were compelled to support the Papal religious system. I am referring to these facts briefly in order to show the constant course of religious intolerance that has existed and persisted for centuries, and then I shall point out from divine prophecy the cause for such unjust and wicked treatment of innocent human creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religious intolerance and persecution maliciously practiced in Europe drove brave men and women to the bleak shores of America, that there they might find a refuge where they could worship God in peace and without interference. It was those brave souls who laid the foundation of the American republic. So completely had religious intolerance been burned into the minds of these early immigrants to America that the framers of the United States Constitution and the constitutions of the various states expressly prohibited by such fundamental law any interference with any person in preaching the gospel and provided that men should be privileged to serve God and preach the gospel according to the dictates of their own conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Selfish and cruel organizations, parading under the name of “Christian”, have steadily and constantly increased in America. They have grown in numbers and grown in power. One of these organizations, to wit, the Papal system, has made every possible attempt to control the United States Government, but up to this hour, thank God, it has never been able to put one of its crowd in the office of president of the United States. The people of America, knowing the history of this system, have resisted every encroachment upon the political affairs, and for this reason the Papal representatives have been the ones who have howled the loudest about bigotry and intolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In these last days, when the faithful followers of Christ Jesus under the clear command of the Almighty God go about to tell the truth to the people in order that the people may be aided and receive comfort, these witnesses are subjected to the most vicious persecution, and this is done upon the pretext of “protecting the people from impostors and robbers”. It is apparent to all that such pretexts or claims are hypocritical and false in the extreme. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Plainfield and vicinity during the past few months has greatly shamed and stunned those who love the principles upon which the American government is founded. The fiasco in the form of a court trial that was enacted in Plainfield recently by men who had sworn to render fair and even-handed justice to its citizens, shocks the sensibilities of every self-respecting American lawyer and causes all honest Americans to hang their heads in shame and to ask, How is it possible for such religious intolerance to be practiced in America now ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">INSTIGATORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that men claim to represent and serve Jehovah God is no evidence that their claim is true. On the contrary, the known facts abundantly show that wicked men and wicked systems parade under the name of God and His Christ who do not have the spirit of Christ but who are cruel in the extreme and who manifest the spirit of Satan the Devil. Those who caused the persecution of Jehovah’s prophets were all religionists. The men who persistently persecuted Jesus, and who caused His death, were the clergymen of that day, and who posed before the people as teachers of God’s Word. The great inquisition practiced for years in Spain and other countries was instigated and carried forward by clergymen of the Papal system. The intolerant persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey and other places in this day is instigated and pushed forward by the clergymen, who pose before the people as preachers and servants of Jehovah God. Jehovah is the God of justice and love and He never persecutes any creature, and no one who is the servant of God could or would persecute any man. Whom, then, do these instigators of religious persecution in modern times represent? Jesus answered that question when He said to the clergymen of His day who were persecuting Him: “Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: . . . Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8: 40,43,44) Jesus authoritatively shows that those men who fraudulently claimed to represent God were in fact the active agents of Satan the Devil. That rule applies at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then turning to His true followers Christ Jesus said to them: “If they [the clergy] have persecuted me, they ■will also persecute you.” (John 15:20) And thus He fixes the responsibility for such persecutions upon the clergy. It was the clergy class that persecuted the apostles of Jesus to death. It is the clergy who have instigated and are pushing forward the intolerant persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey, and upon the authority of the statement made by Jesus these persecutors fraudulently claim to be Christians and to represent God but in fact are the agents and representatives of the Devil and his bidding they will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">END</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now I submit to you the conclusive proof from the Scriptures as to why religious intolerance is practiced in this day; and the specific answer is of vital importance to every human creature, regardless of religious convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God declares in His Word that He permits Satan to go on unhindered in his wicked work until the end of a certain and fixed time and at that time He will destroy Satan and all his agencies. He appointed Christ Jesus to inflict that punishment. When Jesus ascended on high Jehovah said to Him: ‘You must wait until my due time to put down the enemy and destroy him.’ (Psalm 110:1) The Scriptures then show that the year 1914 marks the end of that period of time for waiting and the beginning of the reign of Christ. In His great prophecy recorded in Matthew twenty-four Jesus states that that time would be marked by a world war, followed quickly by famine, pestilence, revolution and distress of nations. All of these things have come to pass since, and which began to have fulfilment in 1914. The Scriptures show that, at the same time, a war was fought in heaven by Jesus and His angels against Satan and his forces and that Satan was ousted from heaven and cast down to the earth. This record is found in the twelfth chapter of Revelation. All of you know that since 1914 the peoples of earth have been in great distress and perplexity. The reason for such suffering and perplexity on the part of the people is made clear by the words of Jesus recorded in Revelation 12:12, which read: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Satan knows that his time is short until the great battle of Armageddon, which will then be decisive as to who is supreme, and at which time Satan's organization shall be destroyed. Before that great battle takes place, however, God commands that His witnesses must go through the land and bear testimony before the rulers and before the people of and concerning Jehovah and His kingdom. (Isaiah 43:10-12; Matthew 24:14) This is done in order that the people may be informed of God’s purpose to destroy the wicked one and to establish a righteous government on earth which will be the means of the complete uplift and blessing of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In obedience to this commandment of Jehovah faithful men and women devoted to God and His kingdom now go from house to house preaching the good news or gospel of the Kingdom. They are not doing such work for commercial gain, but they are doing it at great financial loss to themselves. They work in the shops and in the fields to earn their bread, and then devote their spare time to preaching the gospel according to God’s commandment; and this they do because they love God and have agreed to do His will. In doing this they are but pursuing their divinely given rights of worshiping God according to the dictates of their conscience, and with which rights no municipality, state or other government can properly and rightfully interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the Constitution forbids the enactment of any law or laws interfering with the preaching of the gospel, then why are these faithful witnesses of Jehovah arrested and thrown ndo jail? That question is answered by the Lord, at Revelation 12:17. Jehovah’s testimony is committed primarily to Christ Jesus, and He commits to His faithful followers, who are also Jehovah’s witnesses, the obligation of delivering such testimony. For this reason Satan the Devil seeks to destroy every one who is telling God’s truth. Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth constitute the remnant of God’s organization, which organization is symbolized in this scripture by a woman, and the Lord says concerning these that the Devil is extremely mad at them and goes forth to make war against those who keep the commandments of God and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Revelation 12:17) That scripture is conclusive proof that the Devil is the one who instigates and carries forward the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and that the visible persecutors of these witnesses of Jehovah are acting for and as agents of the Devil. Even though priest, clergymen and other associates in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses claim to be Christian, the facts show that such claims are false, for the reason that God and Christ Jesus do not persecute anyone and certainly God would not have one set of His servants to intolerantly persecute another company of His servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If these fifty or more men and women who were recently persecuted and imprisoned upon the charge of being peddlers and hawkers are in truth and in fact Jehovah’s witnesses and His representatives, and if the charge is false, why then would Jehovah permit them to be thus wrongfully treated and persecuted by men who represent the Devil? The answer is, In order to cause the enemies of God to identify and mark themselves and to afford opportunity for Jehovah’s witnesses to prove their faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptural answer to that question is illuminating and of vital importance. The Scriptures declare that what came to pass upon the Jews, or Israelites, foreshadowed what must come to pass on “organized Christianity” at the end of the world, where we now are. (1 Corinthians 10:11) “Christendom,” or “organized Christianity”, is the antitype of ancient Israel. The Devil overreached the Israelites and turned them away from God. Likewise the Devil has overreached “organized Christianity”, particularly the leaders thereof, and turned such away from God. Because the Jews indulged in Baal religion and persecuted Jehovah’s faithful prophets who were sent to teach them, Jehovah selected Jehu, made him His executioner, and sent him to inflict punishment upon the Baal worshipers of Jewry. On that occasion Jehu was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom God has appointed to execute His judgment against all of His enemies, and particularly against “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehu called a great assembly of the people, and every one of the Baal worshipers assembled at one place. Then Jehu commanded that all the preachers, prophets, clergymen, priests, servants and worshipers of Baal should put on garments by which they would identify themselves as the followers and worshipers of Baal, and this they did. In that manner Jehu caused every one of them to identify himself and to take his stand either on the side of Baal or on the side of Jehovah God. This marvelous picture is set forth in 2 Kings 10:19-28. When the identification and the division were complete, then Jehu directed his soldiers to slay utterly every one of the Baal worshipers, and this was done; and thus ended Baal worship in Palestine at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That graphic identification and the slaying prophetically foretold the identification and destruction of all false religions in the world, and particularly the destruction of all those who defame God's name and persecute His faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The purpose of Jehovah's witnesses in going from house to house in this day and preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom is not to convert the world. The purpose, according to the commandment of God, is to notify the rulers and the people that Jehovah is the God supreme, and that His kingdom is at hand, and that God will now vindicate His name, and that He will now afford the opportunity to all who hear to identify themselves as being either on the side of Jehovah God or on the side of His enemy the Devil. That explains why during the time since the World War Jehovah’s witnesses have been permitted to proclaim the message of His kingdom throughout “Christendom”, and explains why it has been possible in that time to print the message of the Kingdom in fifty-eight different languages and to put in the hands of the people more than 140 million books containing that message. AH this work has been done at God’s commandment to give the people an opportunity to identify themselves as to where they stand. This is God’s work, and no human power can stop it. The intolerant persecutors may throw many of Jehovah’s witnesses into prison and kill others, but that will not stop the witness work. Where one falls in the ranks Jehovah God will raise up others to take his place. He has decreed that the testimony must be given, and it will be given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the gospel of the Kingdom, not for filthy money, but in obedience to God’s commandment, and the only way for men to be faithful to Jehovah and to their covenant is to obey His commandment. Like the early apostles, the witnesses count not their lives dear unto themselves and they are determined to obey God and not man; and for this reason they go on amidst great opposition, bearing testimony to the kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The proof shows that in every instance it has been and is the priests, pastors or clergymen of so-called “organized Christianity” who cause the persecution and ill treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses. Those clergymen are therefore most reprehensible. By their action they have identified themselves as being against God and for His enemy the Devil. The message of the Kingdom in printed form has been supplied to them by Jehovah’s witnesses, and that without charge, and they now without just cause or excuse attempt to hide their wrongful action behind some municipal ordinance, and use this as a shield while they carry on the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus they completely identify and mark themselves. The rulers of “Christendom” have likewise been served with copies of the message of the Kingdom, which affords them an opportunity to take their stand on one side or the other. Police officers, magistrates and judges of the courts are also putting on the garments and thus identifying themselves as to where they stand. Jehovah God therefore permits the persecution of His faithful witnesses now for the very purpose of furnishing opportunity for men to identify and mark themselves and to thus take their stand on one side or on the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the message of the Kingdom must go to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">people,</span><span class="font8"> that they may have an opportunity to identify themselves and to take their stand on one side or the other. The message or gospel of the Kingdom is therefore separating the people into two general classes, and Christ Jesus is the one who is doing that separating work. With which class will you identify yourself? That is a question now which every one who hears must answer. You cannot identify yourself as being on God’s side and at the same time connive at and sympathize with or approve the persecution of Jehovah's witnesses. One of the reasons, therefore, why God permits His witnesses to thus suffer is for your benefit, that you may seo the truth and have the opportunity of identifying yourself with the right side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SHEEP AND GOATS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The last prophetic parable Jesus spoke when on earth was that concerning “the sheep and the goats”, and which prophecy He said would find its fulfilment at the time of His coming for judgment. That time is now here, and the people are thus gathered and by Him made to identify themselves, even as Jehu, the prototype of Jesus, caused the Israelites and Baal worshipers to identify themselves. Jehovah has given the people of the nations of “Christendom” a knowledge of His kingdom, and thus He has gathered them before His Executioner, and who says, as it is written in Matthew 25: “And he shall separate them [the people] ... as a shepherd di-videth </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font8"> sheep from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font8"> goats.” “His sheep” means the class that are on the Lord’s side, while the “goats” represent the class that are against the Lord and on the Devil’s side. Continuing then Jesus said: “And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.” (Matthew 25:33) In this striking prophetic parable Jesus counts His true and faithful followers as though they were Himself, and the people who have been good to His followers He credits as being good unto Himself; and those who have illtreated His brethren or followers He counts as doing evil to Himself. Thus He brings the application of the scripture right down to the present day. He shows that if a person abuses, illtreats or persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses, that person thus identifies himself as an enemy of God and of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of you people have been glad to have Jehovah's witnesses call at your door and tell you the comforting message concerning God’s gracious provision for your blessing. In turn you have given them a cup of refreshing water to drink; and if you found one of them sick you gladly ministered unto that sick one. When the twenty-nine harmless women were crowded into those hot prison cells and required to stand there all night amidst suffering, some of you stood in the streets at midnight and sympathized with them and wished that you might do some good to them. You wanted to comfort them by your presence. The Lord knew your heart condition and your desire and your kind sympathy. He counts that goodness as unto Himself and He likens such who thus sympathize with Him to sheep. To such Jesus says: “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.” (Matthew 25:35,36) On the other hand there is a class of persons pictured by goats because such men are cruel and heartless. Such men are extremely selfish. They have caused innocent men and women to be thrown into prison because they wanted to keep you in ignorance of the goodness of God’s kingdom and to save themselves from being exposed as false teachers and impostors. When men and women assembled in the streets in close proximity to the prison for the purpose of expressing by their presence their sympathy and comfort to the imprisoned ones, and when some tried to make a photograph of the sympathizers and the prisoners, such sympathizers, as well as the prisoners, were illtreated and thrown into prison. Thus the harsh ones, cruel and intolerant persecutors, put themselves in the goat class, and to these billy-goats Jesus now says: “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.” (Matthew 25: 42-45) Thus Jehovah permits cruel and selfish men to intolerantly persecute His faithful witnesses in order that His faithful ones may bear testimony to His name and at the same time cause the persecutors to identify themselves as being against God and His kingdom. Clergymen who pose as your spiritual advisers, and public officials who have sworn to look well to your general interest, have violated their obligation, played the people false, reproached and sneered at and defamed the name of Jehovah God and His Christ, and thus they have put on the garments and have identified themselves as God’s enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, if you will, hear the words of final judgment of Jehovah pronounced by Christ Jesus concerning these two classes who have thus identified themselves. To those who identify themselves as lovers of truth and righteousness, and who are designated under the symbol of harmless sheep and whom the Lord thus places on His right hand of favor, He now says: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Happy is the lot of such!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the cruel, malicious and ruthless persecutors of Jehovah's witnesses and defamers of God’s name, the great Judge, Christ Jesus, now says, as it is written (verses 41 and 46): “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.” Furthermore Jesus said: “Shall not God avenge his own elect [witnesses] ?” Then He answers His own question and says: “I tell you that he will avenge them speedily.”—Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the past two years and more the clergy of this state have persistently and intolerantly persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses, not for doing wrong, but because these faithful men and women, at great financial and physical inconvenience to themselves, have walked in the roads and come to your homes to bring you aid and comfort by bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah and His kingdom. By the intolerance of these priests and clergymen they have thus prevented many honest Catholics and Protestants from hearing the message of God’s kingdom. They have done the people a positive injury and have abused and defamed God’s holy name. It appears to me that by the long and cruel persecution of these faithful men and women God has permitted this day to come that the honest people may hear the truth and have the opportunity to see how they have been grossly deceived by men who should know better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As further proof that God has permitted His faithful witnesses to suffer at the hands of intolerant persecutors in order to cause the persecutors to identify themselves as against Jehovah, note the words of Jesus addressed to His faithful followers, at Mark 13:9: “They [the intolerant persecutors or clergy and their allies] shall deliver you up to [the courts]; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">for a testimony against them,”</span><span class="font8"> that is, against your persecutors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every man must stand before the judgment seat of Christ, and these men who have wrongfully and intolerantly caused the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses will never be heard to make the defense that they did not know they were fighting against God. (2 Corinthians 5:10) They claim to be teachers of the Bible, and they are bound to know what is therein contained. By their course of action they oppose the message of God’s kingdom, and thus they bear testimony against themselves that they are guilty before God. The hypocritical claim that they are punishing Christian men and women in order to “protect the people against impostors and robbers” will be no excuse or defense before the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The faithful witnesses of Jehovah who thus suffer for righteousness’ sake thereby maintain their integrity before God. Filthy prisons will not deter these men and women from continuing to give their testimony. They will rejoice to continue their faithfulness unto God even unto death and to suffer as Christ Jesus suffered. To them therefore the Lord caused these words to be written, at 1 Peter 4:14: “If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But shame upon the priests and clergymen who have connived at and caused the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in order that they might keep the people in ignorance of the truth and thus shield themselves from exposure; shame upon those who have been ready and willing to class Jehovah’s witnesses as selfish peddlers and hawkers in order that they might serve their own selfish ends; shame upon the lawyers who practice upon the bench and before the bar, who because of fear of losing some personal advantage have side-stepped the issue and failed and refused to decide squarely the question as to whether or not men can be prevented from preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom by the enactment and enforcement of municipal ordinances leveled against peddlers and hawkers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reason for this is that we have come to the great crisis foretold by the holy prophets of old. God has placed Christ His King upon His throne and has seated Him in His temple for judgment and commands all men to hear Him. Because of the subtle and wrongful influence of the clergy as Satan’s agents, lawyers, judges and public officials are ashamed of the name of Jesus Christ and of Jehovah and are ashamed to do their duty concerning the construction and enforcement of the law of the land. To such fearful ones Jesus now says (Luke 9: 2G): “For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy angels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world has ended and the Devil must surrender possession. Before he is completely ousted, however, God commands that His testimony concerning the Kingdom must be delivered by His witnesses. Regardless of all opposition these faithful witnesses will proceed to give that testimony; and when that work is done, Jesus declares, there shall immediately follow upon the world the greatest tribulation ever known. (Matthew 24:14-22) That will be the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and not one persecutor of Jehovah’s witnesses shall survive. (Jeremiah 25:34) To the people of good will, and who want to do right and who want to identify themselves as on Jehovah’s side, He now says through His prophet: ‘Before the wrath of God break upon you, seek meekness and righteousness if you would be hidden and taken through that trouble.’ (Zephaniah 2:1-3) Therefore let every one who would live refrain from the intolerant persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, seek meekness and do that which is right. In the language of the Scriptures: ‘If this work be of men it will come to naught; but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it.’—Acts 5:38, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To His faithful witnesses Jehovah by His Word now says: ‘Be of good courage: the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.’ At the hands of religious hypocrites you have suffered much persecution for righteousness’ sake. Our Lord Jesus likewise suffered, and blessed is the man or woman who follows in His steps. (1 Peter 2:21) It is to you as His faithful followers that Jesus now says (Matthew 5:10-12): “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sirs :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just now on my return from Europe I find that in my absence your papers have inaugurated a campaign to prevent the American people from hearing the truth of Jehovah God’s Word which it has been my privilege to tell them for some time. You make me the scapegoat in order to thus deprive the people of the opportunity of learning at this time the very things that they should know, to wit: That Jehovah is the Almighty God; that Christ Jesus is His anointed King; and that the worship of man is an abomination in the sight of God; and that the kingdom of God under Christ is the only remedy for suffering humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This letter I am addressing to you jointly and severally because the charges in your papers are similar and show that you are acting in concert. I have hopes that there may be at least one fair-minded editor among you who will publish this letter that your numerous readers may hear both sides of the case. Your failure to publish this letter will be unfair to the public and may compel me to get this information to the people in another way. Newspapers should publish the truth, if for no other reason than the fact that they accept money from the people for subscriptions upon the implied contract at least that they will publish the truth. The publication of only a small part of the truth is much more unfair than to make no publication at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">EX-CONVICT STORY:</span><span class="font8"> You have attempted to belittle me in the eyes of your readers and thus to do injury to the message I have spoken by charging that I am an “ex-convict”, which charge is untrue. A convict is one who is guilty and is convicted of a crime. When the judgment of a law court is reversed and the case is then dismissed the man against whom the judgment was rendered is exonerated and he is therefore not a convict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Briefly I refer to the facts that you may recall what you should already know: The clergy have hated me for years because I have followed the lead of the Lord Jesus Christ and told the people the truth only as He taught it. A num-her of those men wanted to kill me, and they attempted to find some legal means by which they could accomplish their wicked purpose. The World War seemed to furnish them an opportunity. Shortly after the United States entered the war a convention of clergymen assembled in Philadelphia, laid out a plan of action, and then selected and sent a committee to Washington to carry out their wrongful purpose. They presented a petition to a committee of the United States Senate demanding that the Espionage law be so amended that the trial of alleged offenders must be held before a military court and that the penalty to be inflicted must be death. President Wilson disapproved of their course and the Senate did not amend the law as the clergy desired. A general of the United States army, in the presence of two witnesses besides myself, told me the above facts and then added: “But they are going to get you at any rate.”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">718</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">In the spring of 1918 the clergy and their allies “framed” a case against all the officers of our Society, including myself. I was charged with the publication of an objectionable paragraph in a book which I did not write and which was written and published before the United States entered the war and before the enactment of the Espionage law. Upon this and other illegal testimony, and at the direction of a prejudiced judge, and during the excitement of the war, a jury returned a verdict of guilty and we were sentenced each to eighty years in prison. A Catholic judge denied us the privilege of bail, which the Constitution guarantees we should have, and we were immediately landed in prison. My attorneys prepared a brief setting forth 125 errors in the record of that trial. When the case was presented to a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States upon an application for bail Justice Ilolmes immediately admitted us to bail. The case was then heard by the appellate court, and the judgment reversed and remanded. Because of the gross outrage practiced upon me and my brethren three United States senators and two other prominent American lawyers volunteered to defend me at the next trial. Shortly thereafter the Government dismissed the case and we were thereby exonerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But for the sake of the argument, suppose I were a convict according to your definition. Would that be cause to reject the truth of God’s Word which I am proclaiming? Jesus Christ, Jehovah's greatest witness, was a “convict”, wrongfully charged and convicted of the crime of sedition, and His conviction and death were procured by the clergy of His time; and which wrongdoers find their counterpart in the clergy of the present time. I am delighted to be permitted to follow in the footsteps of Jesus and to be in the same class where the clergy placed Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your papers try to convey to the public the thought that I attempted to hide the fact of this unlawful trial and that you had kept it alive by pigeonholing the facts at the time and now brought it forth. You ought to know better than to try to put over such a falsehood on the people. The clergy thought that court experience above related would finish me for ever. But they were doomed to disappointment. Immediately following my release I visited every large city in America and by full-page advertisements in the largest daily papers invited the public to come and hear. The advertisements amongst other things said: “SENT TO PRISON FOR EIGHTY YEARS BY THE CONSPIRACY OF THE CLERGY —COME AND HEAR THE REASON WHY.” The people crowded out every great hall and theater where I spoke, thousands being turned away. That persecution by the clergy had much to do with advertising our work and enabled me no doubt to write and cause to be placed in the hands of the people more than 140 million books since that time, which books contain the message of God’s kingdom and which are published in 58 different languages. You are welcome to all the satisfaction you can get out of that “ex-convict” story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">RADIO:</span><span class="font8"> Because in a recent radio address </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">stated the plain truth for the benefit of the people, your papers, at the instance of Catholic clergymen, began a vicious campaign to “silence” me. Vigorously you say, “Rutherford must be muzzled; he must be silenced; put him off the air.” With the hope of accomplishing that end you and your associates inaugurated a campaign of coercion against radio stations. You threatened to boycott these stations, to cause building contracts and paint contracts, and many other contracts, to be canceled, and to use every means within your power to injure the stations and their clients financially. AH fair-minded men and women must and do condemn your course of action and your mode of procedure which is entirely un-American and unfair. The people are entitled to know the truth. If </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">have stated falsehoods against your organization, then it is your duty to show the people wherein the statements made by me are untrue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It appears that the Catholic clergymen have no weapon of defense except a gag and a bludgeon. Every man who speaks the truth, which truth does not tingle the ears of the clergy, the Catholic clergy say should be gagged. Every one who publishes the truth contrary to their ideas of what is right the Catholic clergy say should be browbeaten, coerced and clubbed into submission. God and Christ Jesus never employed any such methods, and that of itself is most conclusive proof that men who resort to the gag and bludgeon method do not represent God and Christ. Such methods used to keep the people in ignorance and to blind them to the truth are the ones employed by Satan the Devil. (2 Corinthians 4:4) When a man, whether a clergyman or the editor of a newspaper, resorts to the gag and bludgeon method, whom then does he represent, God or the Devil? Judge ye!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">gag</span><span class="font8"> and bludgeon method employed by you and the clergymen of your organization frightened a few radio stations into submission and caused them to cancel their contracts. Out of the numerous radio stations in the United States used by me to broadcast the truth you succeeded in inducing ten stations to cancel their contracts. That is a rather good record in America for your method of procedure. If you had a Roman Catholic in the office of president of the United States now you would browbeat every radio station in the land into submission. Thank God your intolerant organization has never been able to place one of your organization in the office of president of the United States. The more the American people learn about you and your unjust methods, the more they shun you; and you know that to be true, and that is why you employ the gag and bludgeon. There are millions of good Catholic people who heartily disapprove of your unrighteous methods of suppressing the truth, and of this I have positive knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">SLANDER:</span><span class="font8"> You charge me with attacking men with slanderous speech. That charge is wholly untrue. Never have I delivered a radio speech or other public address in which I have attacked any man. I have called in question the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">doctrines </span><span class="font8">men teach to the people; and if that is not permissible, then the people would be compelled to hear only what your side has to say, regardless of how untrue your statements are. That is another proof of your coercive and bludgeon methods. I have no quarrel with any individual, and no occasion to attack personally any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You claim to believe the Bible and to teach it, and therefore you are bound by what the Bible says. The Bible says that Jehovah is the only true God, and that Christ Jesus His beloved Son is King; that Satan the Devil is the opponent of God, and that the Devil resorts to fraud, deceit, coercion and bludgeon methods to blind the people to the truth. Men are either servants of God or servants of Satan the Devil, and by the fruits or doctrines which they carry to the people it is to be determined whom they represent. It is written in the Scriptures: “Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Romans 6:16) In harmony with this Jesus states: “He that is not with me is against me”; and that is true whether the one be a priest or a layman. (Luke 11:23) Again: “If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.” (Romans 8: 9) Christ never employed coercive, gag or bludgeon methods to accomplish His purposes. When men employ such wrongful methods, contrary to Christ, then they prove that they have not the spirit of Christ, and that they are not His servants but that they are servants of the enemy of God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is true that the “spirit of Christ is love”, but that does not mean that He loved wickedness and that He stood by and saw pious-faced hypocrites proceed to deceive the people and remained silent because He might “offend the sensibilities” of the clergy or some of their allies. Read the twenty-third chapter of Matthew, wherein Jesus denounced the clergy of His day in the most scathing language that has ever been applied to any creatures. He was speaking to men then who posed before the people as the representatives of God, and He plainly told them that they were hypocrites. Love, which is the spirit of Christ, means an unselfish effort put forth to do good to others and to honor Jehovah God. It does not mean to consent to the name of Jehovah God’s being defamed. The mere fact that a man bears the title of clergyman or priest is no evidence that such a man represents God or Christ or that he speaks the truth. In proof of this, note the words of Jesus addressed to the clergymen and priests of His</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">day who denounced Him for telling the truth. He said to them: “Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God. . . . Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">father the devil,</span><span class="font8"> and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speak-eth a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:40-44) The Scriptures then show that exactly a similar condition would exist at the end of the world, where we now are, and that clergymen would boast of their own goodness and greatness and defame God’s name and persecute humble men and women who attempt to tell the truth.—See John 15:19,20; Mark 13:9; 2 Timothy 3:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why should the people be denied the opportunity of learning what God’s Word teaches, merely because those divine truths when uttered “offend the sensibilities” of certain men who are not in harmony with God? I agree that one man has no right to attack another man personally; but when any man brings forth a doctrine relating to God’s dealing with the human race and asks the people to believe that doctrine, then it is the right and duty of others who do not agree to call attention to the fact that such doctrines promulgated do not proceed from God but proceed from God’s enemy the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have nothing against Catholics as men or women. I only take issue with the doctrines which that organization teaches. If the Catholic clergy want to be fair, why don’t they accept my proposition to publicly discuss these questions or doctrines and then let the people determine for themselves which is truth? The gag and bludgeon method can never make any of the people free, but, in the language of Jesus, “the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32) You claim to speak for millions of Catholics; but I tell you that you do not speak for them. There are millions of good people in the Catholic organization who do not believe what you say. Why not let them all have an opportunity to hear both sides of the question discussed and then let them speak for themselves? You are not their guardians except by self-appointment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">THE POPE:</span><span class="font8"> Your papers say that I “slandered the Pope whose integrity is unquestioned by any reputable character”. You cannot cite a single word that I have ever uttered that is a slander of the man who occupies the office of pope of the Catholic organization. I have said nothing whatsoever against him as a man. What I did say is that no man, pope or otherwise, has any authority from God and Christ to declare any year a holy year. Neither Jehovah God nor Christ Jesus ever created the office of pope, and nowhere in the Bible does any such title appear. Neither God nor Christ Jesus ever appointed any man to the position of pope of the Catholic organization, and I call upon you to publish one word from the Holy Scriptures that even tends to prove to the contrary. The title of pope was never applied to any man until more than 300 years after the crucifixion of Christ. (See Volumes 6 and 22, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica; McClintock £ Strong’s Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font8"> Volume 8, page 403.) If God and Christ wanted the pope on earth to tell the people what they shall believe or not believe, then why does not the Bible, which is the Word of God, give some evidence of that fact?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have no personal antipathy to the man who at the present time holds the office of pope of the Catholic church. So far as I know, he may be a good man of the highest integrity, as that term is generally applied. I know nothing about him except that recently when I used a number of radio stations in Europe to broadcast the message of God’s kingdom I was informed that the pope had instructed all Catholics to refuse to listen to what I had to say. They did not obey him, however, because I had many letters of approval and commendation and best wishes from Catholics, which letters came from Holland, France, Austria, Spain, Italy and other places in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that a man occupies the office of pope of the Catholic organization is no evidence that he speaks with divine authority or that he has the approval of God and of Christ. In proof of this I refer you to the historical facts concerning men of the past who have occupied that office. The records of many of these men are too bad to publish here. Some of them were exceedingly immoral and bad men, which proves that they were not servants of God and of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You speak of the pope as “the holy father”, and your sensibilities are shocked when others do not publicly agree with you. You do this in the face of the plain statement by Jesus, to wit: “Call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” (Matthew 23:9) Surely I should be permitted to quote the words of the Lord Jesus without offending honest men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since neither Jehovah God nor Christ created the office of pope and no mention is made thereof in the Word of God, and since God’s Word does not authorize any man or the officer of any organization to declare this a ‘‘holy year”, then </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">ask by what authority any official in any organization can declare this a “holy year”. Is it your desire to mislead the people and to induce them to believe that a man has the authority and power to make any year holy &quot;? When this year is past and the people look back upon the great amount of suffering they have endured, and upon the great amount of wickedness and injustice practiced both inside and outside of the Catholic organization, they will well know that this is not a holy year, regardless of all proclamations concerning the same. There are millions of people on earth who do not believe that the pope has the authority or power to declare this or any other year a holy year, and other millions of people have the right to hear the evidence, that they too may determine for themselves what they want to believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I suggest to you that no court or tribunal in America has ever yet decided (and I hope never will) that a man can be prevented from calling in question the doctrines or teachings of other men or organizations. If such a coercive rule as you advocate &quot;were adopted and enforced, then it would mean that the political party in power could successfully prevent the other parties out of power from calling attention to actions and policies falsely advocated and practiced upon the people. If you could have your way you would compel the people of America to acknowledge without question the doctrines of the Catholic organization, which doctrines the masses of the people do not believe to be true. Whenever the courts exercise the power to prohibit the criticism of doctrines or teachings of any organization, then the liberties of the American people are gone and the purpose for which the nation was organized has ceased to exist. You, the editors of newspapers, who claim that you are publishing your papers in the interest of the people, by calling upon the radio commission to bar any man from the air because he calls in question the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">doctrines</span><span class="font8"> of your organization, are thereby demanding that the courts or tribunals take away the liberties of the people and keep the people in ignorance of what God’s Word plainly teaches. Whom do you then represent in thus trying to blind the people to the truth of Jehovah God’s Word? (2 Corinthians 4:4) Surely you do not represent Jehovah God; and that being true, you must be the servants of the god of this world whether you know it or not.—Romans 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">OTHER FALSEHOODS:</span><span class="font8"> Almost everything you have published about my radio speeches is false. You charge me with indulging in “vituperation”, which is entirely foreign to the facts. Your statement concerning the radio and its use in Canada is also untrue. There some clergymen, who did not want to hear the truth, protested to the Commission and the Commission stopped the broadcast. You did not publish the further fact, however, that immediately thereafter 406,000 citizens of Canada filed with the Canadian House of Commons a petition asking that my lectures be continued on the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The message which I and my brethren are proclaiming is not the message of any man, but it is Jehovah God’s message concerning His kingdom. You may be able to prevent radio stations from broadcasting the truth and the Lord may not interfere with you for a time, but His arm is not shortened and you will not at all retard the proclamation of His Word. Your opposition has only increased the desire of the people to hear more about God’s kingdom, and Jehovah has provided the ways and means. Already hundreds of transcription machines have been manufactured and placed in the hands of the people, with numerous records of speech, which are daily being delivered to the people and informing them concerning God’s kingdom. Every day the people are learning more and more that opposition such as you offer does not proceed from Jehovah, but that it proceeds from the god of this world, the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You say that these lectures are attacks on Catholics and insulting to Catholics. The people know that such statement by you is untrue. Every statement yet made in any of my lectures is fully supported by the Word of God, which is the truth. (John 17:17) No honest person could be insulted by God’s Word of truth. Thore are many honest persons in the ranks of the Catholic organization who have been held there because they had no opportunity to hear and to learn the truth. But they are learning it now. For keeping the people in ignorance in this manner the pastors and clergymen and priests and their allies are held liable, and God gives His Word that He will punish them for their wrong-doing.-See Ezekiel 34:1-20; Jeremiah 25: 33-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You charge that my words are seditious; and that is wholly false. Never have I uttered a seditious word against the Government. It was the clergymen and priests and their allies that falsely charged Jesus with the crime of sedition ; and hiding behind the judgment of a false and wicked court, they caused His precious blood to be wrongfully shed. You may get my lifeblood and thereby hope to stop the proclamation of the truth; but be assured that the message of God’s kingdom will continue to be proclaimed just the same. I am but one of those of Jehovah’s witnesses who as a “voice in the wilderness” is crying out to the people that the kingdom of heaven is at hand and that this kingdom under Christ is the only hope of mankind. Your gag and bludgeon methods will not in any manner retard the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom, which He is now sending to the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">JUDGMENT:</span><span class="font8"> Jehovah God has written His judgment against Satan and every part of his organization, both visible and invisible, and at the battle of the great day of God Almighty, led by Jesus Christ, that judgment will be executed and every part of the wicked organization shall go down to destruction. Then the Catholic organization as such will be no more; and only those honest Catholics who turn their hearts away from “man worship”, and who turn them wholly to the worship and service of Jehovah God and Christ, will survive. For this reason Jehovah now says to His people through His prophet: “Before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you . . . seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zephaniah 2: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s judgment is written against the pastors and the shepherds and clergymen who have taught and misled the people and who together with the principal of their flocks have coerced radio stations and others to refrain from proclaiming the truth of God’s kingdom. His judgment written shows that such opposers will find no way of escape at the execution of His judgment at Armageddon. Note Jeremiah 25: 34-36: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You complain because I speak the truth concerning “purgatory”. For many years the Catholic organization has taught the people that their dead friends are conscious in a place called “purgatory” and that Catholic priests, who are merely imperfect men, can pray for the dead and benefit them and thereby shorten the duration of their punishment and in time secure their release from “purgatory”. You will not attempt to deny this as one of the doctrines preached by your organization, and this you have done and continue to do in the face of the scriptures which read that ‘all the dead are in the grave’ (John 5: 28); and, “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.” (Psalm 115:17) “The dead </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">know not any thing&quot;;</span><span class="font8"> “there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5,10) You would have the people believe you rather than to believe God’s Word of truth. By your teaching of this false doctrine of “purgatory” you have induced many a poor person to give up his or her money to have prayers said for their dead ones who are supposed to be in “purgatory”. That is obtaining money by taking advantage of the ignorance of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">COMPARISON:</span><span class="font8"> In this letter I would have made no reference to personal deeds committed by men or organizations except for the fact that you have made it necessary. You could have opposed my speech without attacking me personally. In keeping with your fixed policy you have preferred the latter; therefore the comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The best part of my life on earth and all my material substance has been spent in an honest endeavor to teach the people the plain Word of God’s truth and to turn the minds of men away from creature worship and turn them to the faithful worship and service of Jehovah God that they might gain eternal life in endless happiness. In that time you have been able to find but one so-called ‘black spot’ on my record, namely, the fact that I was imprisoned during the World War, and which imprisonment was procured by a cruel conspiracy formed and carried into effect by your organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholic hierarchy has spent more than 1500 years in hiding the truth of God’s Word from the people and in turning the minds of men to the service and worship of creatures instead of the worship and service of Jehovah God. The work of that hierarchy has been and is done by selfish men concerning which the Scriptures say: “Men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain [in numbers of followers and material wealth] is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.” (1 Timothy 6:5) Every page of the history of the Catholic hierarchy is marked with black crime. It has employed the cruel Inquisition to compel the people to follow its doctrines and practices. It has in all those fifteen centuries resorted to coercion to silence everyone who has dared to call in question its doctrines. If your organization held and taught the truth you would welcome criticism and would gladly come forward and discuss the matter in the presence of the people, that they might exercise their own free will and determine for themselves what they wished to believe. Since you have no truth, and since your organization was ‘born in sin and shapen in iniquity’, you resort to cruel and oppressive methods to hide your sins and to deceive the people. Why don’t you hear and teach the truth and encourage others to do likewise? In the language of Jesus the answer is, Because “ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do”.—John 8:43,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although you know that up to this time there is no law in America to prevent the free expression of opinion concerning the doctrines or teachings of others, yet you continue to browbeat, threaten to boycott and otherwise to coerce radio stations to prevent the broadcasting of the truth. You claim that you do this in the interest of common decency and for the good of the people; which claim is hypocritical in the extreme. You cry “intolerance” and “bigotry”, when in fact your organization is the most intolerant and bigoted one in existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because I say to the public that no man, whether he be a pope or otherwise, can make a year holy, for the reason that only God can make things holy, you begin an intolerant campaign against me and my brethren, which campaign you carry on maliciously and without regard for the rights of the people. Simultaneously the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses starts in the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. Did this </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">happen?</span><span class="font8"> or is it the carrying out of an order from the headquarters of your hierarchy? You were the first ones in America to report the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in Bavaria; and this for the very reason that it was incited and carried out by members of your intolerant organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was at the instance of your organization that in June last twenty-nine innocent and faithful women citizens of New Jersey were arrested in Plainfield and thrown into prison, crowded into small and filthy cells, and required to stand up all night, and this because as Jehovah’s witnesses they were calling at the homes of the people in this time of distress, and seeking to comfort them by directing them to the study of God’s Word of truth. The arrest and imprisonment of those good and faithful women was not only intolerant, but was barbaric cruelty, wholly uncalled for in a civilized land. There was a time when the Protestant church organizations resented your oppressive methods; but in this evil day they have ceased to protest, and this makes you ever more bold in your persecution of the true followers of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">APPROACHING STORM:</span><span class="font8"> From every quarter of the earth I see gathering together the hordes of Satan under the leadership of Gog, of which the Catholic hierarchy is the greatest visible part, and all of these marching on with the malicious purpose and intent to accomplish the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses. I know that already your hierarchy is seeking some apparent legal excuse to kill all of Jehovah’s ■witnesses. I would be appalled and faint with sickness because of what I see is shortly coming upon the earth were it not for the fact that Jehovah has given His Word that He will smite the wicked oppressive organization and deliver His faithful people. Jehovah’s witnesses must and will finish the work God has assigned to them. That witness work may be about done for the present; and when completed, then there shall come upon the world, as the Lord Jesus declares, “great tribulation, such as was not [known] since the beginning of the world.”— Matthew 24:14-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergy of the Catholic hierarchy have assumed to be shepherds of the people and call themselves such, but they are not true shepherds; hence Jehovah now says to them: “Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.” (Ezekiel 34:10) Jehovah then says that this shall be the plague wherewith He will smite those that have fought against His organization: “Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.” (Zechariah 14:12) Jehovah God will exercise His power in the interest of the poor and oppressed people: “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.” —Psalm 72:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, gentlemen, I have said nothing here in malice, but have written these lines wholly in the interest of truth and righteousness. I have called your attention to the Scriptures as well as to the facts, and every one who honestly serves God wants to be judged according to the Scriptures and the facts. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.” (2 Corinthians 5:10) You have received notice, and when standing before that judgment seat of Christ, who is the great Judge, you can never be heard to say that you </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ignorantly</span><span class="font8"> opposed the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom which is now being carried to the people by Jehovah’s witnesses. I think you have heretofore received a copy of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom</span><span class="font8"> booklet; but, that there may be no mistake, I am sending each of you a copy, under separate cover, with my compliments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You and other clergymen whom you represent have declined my kind invitation to come forth in the open and discuss the truth, that the people might hear and judge. You have thus prevented them from hearing the truth. You prefer to resort to coercion, gag and bludgeon methods to thus keep them in ignorance. You have received fair notice. Now you must take the responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Respectfully,</span></p><img src="g_E_19330816_files/g_E_19330816-2.png" alt="" style="width:72pt;height:28pt;">

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday School Times,</span><span class="font8"> which, as much as any paper we know of, has resisted and does resist the establishment of God’s kingdom as the one hope of the world, has recently published a series of articles admitting that we are now living in the times of which Jesus spoke in which He said there would be “distress of nations with perplexity”. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> suggests that the word “perplexity” seems to signify “without trade”, and the word does have that significance, but an examination of the word seems to indicate that it also conveys the thought that there is “no way out”; in other words, Armageddon is sure to come, and all hopes of deliverance by any other route are vain. This is in accord with the statement of the prophet, “The shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Jeremiah 25: 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">D</span><span class="font8">URING the three years of the depression, within which three years the great life insurance companies have had much assistance from the federal and the various state governments, the salary of the president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society was increased by $25,000 a year, the salary of the president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company was increased $25,000 a year, the salary of the president of the Mutual Life Insurance Company was increased $25,000 a year, and the salary of the president of the New York Life Insurance Company was increased $25,000 a year. But you will be interested to know that the wages of the clerks and the little fellows generally were cut about 15 percent. The great minds that have got America where she now is must be taken care of, no matter what happens to the common people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE system by which the people of the city of Erie, Pennsylvania, are robbed is that the Erie Lighting Company is owned by the Pennsylvania Electric Company, which is a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Electric Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Associated Electric Company, which is a subsidiary of the Associated Gas and Electric Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Associated Gas and Electric Company. By the time the Erie householder has paid all the rake-offs, his electricity costs him about 70 percent more than is regularly paid by the householder in the near-by town of Ashtabula.</span></p>

Troops have been shifted so as to be instantly available in case of trouble in any of the great centers of population, or mining or industrial areas. The way the shift became known was when the storekeepers in the old army centers found their trade was gone and complained to their congressmen. The new method of distribution of troops is called the “Black” plan. Radicals have been weeded out of the army and if trouble starts anywhere there will be numerous funerals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">C</span><span class="font8">ONCERNING the Nazi revolution in Germany, Frederick T. Birchall, in a wireless dispatch to the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The biggest thing in the recent German happenings has not been the political overturn so skillfully brought about in the election of last March, but the political and social revolution that has been accomplished since. Within six short weeks the entire face of Germany has been wiped clean as with a sponge and new features have been written thereon; the whole social, economic, educational and governmental system has been swept away and a new and untried system administered by new and inexperienced directors has been substituted. Nothing in previous revolutionary history has been quite like it. It has been accomplished with untold hardship and suffering, to which thousands of decent, patriotic citizens bereft of place and employment, thousands of political opponents now penned in barbed-wire concentration camps and condemned to hard labor as a penalty for their opposition, and fewer thousands self-exiled to escape the terrors of the new regime can testify.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">amuel Rothstein, 104 years of age, has run away again. This is the third time that he has collected his things and sneaked out of the Home of Old Israel. Once he was out when the thermometer showed 88 degrees. He went in swimming with some younger boys and had to be pulled out. This last time he was out five hours. He stepped into a synagogue, and the rabbi wormed it out of him that he was a runaway ; and that is how they got him. Samuel is a good boy usually. The only thing about him is that he will run away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HIS year there are just twice as many boy criminals in New York city as last year. “Juvenile delinquency is increasing,” said District Attorney Thomas C. T. Crain. “Youth is the most persistent violator of law. The need for the development in the young of moral fiber was never more urgent than now.” All this talk about moral fiber is so much ballyhoo. Children and grown-ups act upon what they believe. Having wrong, misleading and superstitious ideas presented to them by word and example, it is not surprising that they follow the course they do.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font8"> RATHER comical incident happened in Washington on March 4. Chief Justice Hughes, with hand upraised and ready to administer the oath of office to Mr. Roosevelt, had to wait until the radio announcer Edwin C. Hill had announced to all the world what the chief justice was doing, or rather what he was about to do. It is the first time a chief justice of the Supreme Court and an incoming president, a dictator at that, have had to wait until a radio announcer had finished with his spiel. But so is the world in which we live today. Argentina, Australia and Europe reported clear reception.</span></p>
