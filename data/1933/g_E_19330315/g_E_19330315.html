<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Canada’s Impossible Radio Censor, Hector Charlesworth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font6">UDAS, had he wanted to make the most of his chosen course, might have remained alive and got himself appointed to some place in the Roman government where he could censor the words of Jesus’ followers. Of course we do not know that Hector Charlesworth, Canada’s bigoted radio censor, will ultimately come to the same fate as Judas. That remains to be seen. The Lord alone will judge him, but we can see the direction in which his course is leading him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judas committed suicide and thus cleansed somewhat the atmosphere of the community in which he had lived. We hope that Charlesworth may repent before he finally takes the irrevocable step of complete willful ambushment of those who are committed to the service of the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Judas’ place in history is established almost entirely by his cowardly, treacherous and unprovoked attack upon the One who broke bread with him, so Hector Charlesworth is first noticed in another of the most small-souled acts ever perpetrated by anyone able to frame words into sentences. It is as the editor of the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font6"> that he first draws attention to himself as the defender of the clergy, something, it would seem, that no honest and intelligent man can do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Let Us Get the Setting</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In July, 1927, there gathered in the city of Toronto an audience of 15,000 earnest men and women to listen to an address entitled “Freedom for the Peoples”, by Judge J. F. Rutherford. That address was so important that those men and women and their friends subsequently placed more than fifty million copies of it in the hands of the people everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was so important that for the first time in broadcasting history fifty-three stations, linked together in a coast-to-coast international hookup. broadcast it to millions in many lands. The address centered around the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the Peoples of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The International Bible Students in general convention assembled send greetings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Christians and witnesses to the name of Jehovah God, we deem it our privilege and duty to call your attention to the following vital facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">First: That God made of one blood all peoples and nations of men to dwell on the earth, and granted to all peoples equal rights. There is therefore no just cause or excuse for one nation to make war against another nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Second: That the foremost nations of the earth claim to be Christian nations and, taken collectively, they constitute “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, so called; that the men chiefly responsible for the claim that these are Christian nations are the clergymen of the various religious denominations, who call themselves by the name of Christ but who in fact have denied Him; that their purpose of claiming that these nations are Christian is to induce the peoples to believe that said nations, although military and cruel, are the representatives of God and His Christ on earth; that such claim is fraudulent and false and has turned the minds of millions of honest people away from the true God and from His Christ; that the invisible ruler of the nations of ‘ ‘ Christendom ”, or “ organized Christianity”, so called, is Satan the Devil, who has fathered the scheme of forming “organized Christianity” to deceive the people and to keep them in subjection to himself and his agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the masses of the peoples of the nations are entitled to self-government exercised by the people for the general welfare of all; but instead of enjoying such rights a small minority rules; that the money power of the world has been concentrated into the hands of a few men called high financiers, and these in turn have corrupted the men who make and execute the laws of the nations, and the faithless clergy have voluntarily joined forces with the high financiers and professional politicians, and that said unholy alliance constitutes the governing powers that rule the peoples; that the masses of the peoples, acting under a misapprehension of the true facts, have borne up, carried, supported and maintained “organized Christianity”; and that without the support of the common</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">people the unholy alliance constituting “organized Christianity” could not long exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Third: That for centuries the privileges enjoyed by men have been wholly unequal and unfair. The multitudes have produced the wealth of the world, but have been unjustly deprived of the fruits of their labors. That the leaders of “Christendom”, instead of teaching the children of men the doctrines of Christ, whom they claim to follow, teach them to murder their fellow creatures; and that now the rulers are amalgamating the common people with the military, in order to make all the peoples a part of and subject to their great war machine; that by unjust laws the common people, contrary to their own wishes, have been compelled to go to war against each other, resulting in great sorrow and suffering, multitudes of broken hearts and millions of untimely graves; that “organized Christianity” has turned a deaf ear to the petitions and entreaties of the people for relief, and now the cries of the oppressed people have entered into the ears of Jehovah God, and His time is at hand to give the peoples deliverance and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fourth: That Jehovah is the only true God, the Friend and Benefactor of the peoples. He has now set His beloved Son Christ Jesus upon His throne, and bids all the peoples of earth to hear and to obey Him who is earth’s rightful King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fifth: That the kings and rulers of the earth, to wit, those constituting the said unholy alliance, have been duly notified that God has set His King upon His throne and that His kingdom is at hand; but they refuse to understand or to take heed, and they walk on in darkness. Therefore God has decreed and declared that there shall come upon the world a time of tribulation such as never was known; and that during that trouble “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”, so called, and all of Satan’s organization shall be destroyed; and that Christ Jesus, the righteous King, will assume complete authority and control and will bless the peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sixth : That it must be now apparent to all thoughtful peoples that relief, comfort and blessings so much desired by them can never come from the unrighteous system of “Christendom” or “organized Christianity ’ ’, and that there is no reason to give further support to that hypocritical and oppressive system. In this hour of perplexity Jehovah God bids the peoples to abandon and for ever forsake “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” and to turn completely away from it, because it is the Devil’s organization, and to give it no support whatsoever; and that the peoples give their heart’s devotion and allegiance wholly to Jehovah God and to His King and kingdom and receive full freedom and the blessings God has in store for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seventh: For four thousand years the cherished desire of Jews has been God’s Messianic kingdom. For </span><span class="font5">nineteen centuries that kingdom has been the hope of real Christians. It is now at hand. True to His promise God by and through the reign of Christ will lift the burdens of the peoples, free them from war, fraud and oppression, from sickness, suffering and death and give to them a righteous government and the blessings of everlasting peace, prosperity, life, and happiness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Hard to Match</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">This noble, courageous, true and faithful statement of facts, embodied in the remarkable address given on that occasion by Judge Rutherford, should have awakened a hearty response in every heart in the city in which he was then a guest, and did awaken such response in thousands, yes, millions, then and since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But at that time, Hector Charlesworth was editor-in-chief of the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night. </span><span class="font6">We prefer to let a Canadian tell what he thinks of that periodical, and in this connection readers will find the accompanying communication of Axel Nielsen of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First, though, let us put in the record here the editorial for- which Mr. Charlesworth is responsible, and which he doubtless wrote. It appeared in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font6"> issue of August 6, 1927, on “The Front Page”, and for rare shamelessness it would be hard to match anywhere:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VISITING ORATORS TAKE NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RECENTLY Toronto had the doubtful honor of entertaining once more a heavy-jowled flannel-mouth known as “Judge” J. F. Eutherford, Grand Vizier of the “Russellites” or the International Bible Students’ Association, together with some thousands of his followers. What the said Rutherford is a “Judge” of we do not know,—perhaps of cigars, perhaps of fat swine,—perhaps he is called ‘ ‘ Judge ’ ’ by way of persiflage, just as an elevator man is called ‘ ‘ Cap ’ ’. What we wish to emphasize is that “Judges” and wandering orators of the Rutherford type are unwelcome guests. This is we hope the last occasion on which the Russellite Chieftain and his mob of “students” will be allowed to misuse important civic property like the Canadian National Exhibition Grounds. The average international convention is more than welcome in Toronto but its citizens want no more “Russellite” gatherings here. Such conventions bring small gain, since most of the delegates travel in ‘ ‘ tin lizzies ’ ’ and bring their dough-nuts with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rutherford is no stranger in Toronto. He comes round every once in a while heralded by a slogan of which he is the author: “Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” There is no harm in his cherishing that delusion; but when he violates the law of hospitality by abuse of the British Empire (which he regards as a section of one of the beasts of the Apocalypse); when he traduces every reputable clergyman and every well-to-do citizen in the community, he is going a little too far. It is true that he is equally abusive of fellow citizens in the United States but let him stay on his own soil and hurl his mud there. This same Rutherford spent a term in a detention camp after the United States entered the Great War, and prior to that time the “Russellites” had been in trouble with Canadian authorities because their extensive publishing department had sold out to Bernstorf! and was caught in the act of distributing proGerman propaganda in Canadian towns and cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The war is over and peace-loving people are willing to let by-gones be by-gones, but they do object to wandering blatherskites and professional liars starting the war all over again on Canadian soil. That Rutherford is a lying demagogue is apparent from the text of his addresses, in which he exploits the old fallacy that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor, a condition which is certainly not true of Canada, or any part of the British Empire. Clerical dialecticians may be left to answer his attacks on Christianity and refute the charge that their master is Satan, if they wish. The day that the ‘ ‘ common people ’ ’ yield to his appeal and ‘ ‘ forsake organized Christianity and its clergy as the instruments of the devil” will be a hey-day for Satan if that historic person still happens to be going about like a roaring lion. When the “Judge” indulges in tirades against capital and capitalists as oppressors of the common people, he not only prompts curiosity as to his own bank account, but utters a dangerous falsehood. It is true that there has been a great accumulation of capital in the hands of a comparatively small group, but it is also true, especially in America, that never have conditions been so good for the poor; never at any time in the history of mankind was labor so well rewarded, never was so much practical philanthropy practiced for the care of the weak and needy, never was so much capital freely available for the cate and comfort of the underprivileged. Only a fool or a liar could deny these facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reason this loquacious “Judge” has received so much attention of late is that he managed to bulldoze his way into control of the air during the progress of the Russellite convention of Toronto. He gave credit for this, not to himself, but to “Jehovah, the only true God,” who, he said, had “graciously used the National Broadcasting Company for his divine purposes. ’ ’ The tribal god of the Russellites certainly gained no popularity with users of radio thereby; their deliberations were a nightly nuisance in the air. On the night of July 21st reputable fathers of families anxious to listen in on the progress of the Dempsey-Sharkey prize fight were kept out by the high power oratory at the Toronto Coliseum. On Sunday, July 24th, the religiously inclined were prevented from hearing their favorite message because the leather-lunged Rutherford had the air. Millions now living would rather die than be compelled to listen very often to his discourses.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>“So They Elevated You”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">That full censorship of radio broadcasting throughout the Dominion should be entrusted temporarily to the lace-skirted, reversed-collar fraternity of Canada is, of course, a development to be expected at this time in British Empire activity. But why must the fraternity hire one like Charlesworth? The answer is self-evident. Hand-picked for the job, he is, we presume, one of the few in the country to the north who could and would stoop to do the dirty work prescribed for him by the ecclesiastical frauds, and who would stop at nothing to gain his ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this point we insert a letter from Mr. Axel Nielsen, of Cranberry Portage, Manitoba, Canada, addressed to us, together with a copy of his letter to the Canadian radio commission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">January 23, 1933. The Golden Age, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gentlemen :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have been deprived of Judge Rutherford's broadcasts by the asinine action of the much heralded Radio Commission which was to cure all our many broadcasting ills. However, the personnel was appointed by a reactionary premier, and in Canada Parliament does not censor appointments as in the case of the American Senate, or Hector Charlesworth, editor of a reactionary rag, would never have succeeded to the chairmanship of this important Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hector Charlesworth was for many years editor of Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night,</span><span class="font5"> a weekly whose financial section is dominated by the crowd which is persecuting James Harpel, and the same War Babies who have secured control of Canadian finance, industry and insurance. The editorial portion of this paper, a front page feature, devotes itself zealously to the furtherance of all the forgotten bunk of kings and tyrants, class and privilege. As for the rest, it consists mainly of social chatter, marriages, photos of socially prominent persons, and all the snobs parade of these classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font5"> is a thoroughly wretched paper, but enlightened people do not deny this paper the right to preach their Middle Age doctrines. Still, the trouble with Canada is that the Press is modeled along the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font5"> lines throughout, with mighty few exceptions, the Vancouver </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font5"> being one of the few, if not the only major newspaper to permit Liberalism space in its columns. And now the radio is throttled by public ownership, of all things!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the enclosed letter to Hector Charlesworth, together with this one to explain it further, could be reprinted in your paper I am sure many Canadians would appreciate the publicity which the Radio Commission’s degenerate action deserves, and Americans might learn by our sad experiences and provide proper safeguards when it comes time for them to take over their own radio stations on a public basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yours truly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Axel Nielsen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A LETTER TO THE CANADIAN RADIO COMMISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">January 23, 1933</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hector Charlesworth, Esq.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chairman, Radio Commission, Ottawa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I used to admire you in the way one might admire the Devil for his ingenuity, no matter what I might think otherwise of either you or the Devil, for the hypocritical narratives in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font5"> written or selected by yourself. They must have been hard to write; for such things do not come from the heart, but rather must they spring from a taskmaster like gold, or the degradingly pleasant feeling of going downstream without effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And so they elevated you to the Radio Commission, where your aptitude for being thoroughly reactionary is to shine and adorn the ether; but not on my radio, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I got so fed up with Canadian stations that I forgot they were on the air until Judge Rutherford began to broadcast at convenient hours over the Canadian stations. I do not agree with the judge on all points, but his talks are very interesting, as apart from the bunk fed the Canadian public by men of your type, tutelage and vassalage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The press gave considerable advance publicity to the speech promised Canadians, and to be delivered by His Majesty, George V. But the next time you busy yourself with this sort of thing, which is interesting mainly from the standpoint of conjecture as to just what sort of a mess can be made of it, please be more thoughtful of His Majesty’s subjects. I object to getting up at 8: 00 a.m. to hear George V or anyone else, even including yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real purpose of this letter is to let you know that I object, as a Canadian with a radio license, to a person of your connections and past, or any one person or a dozen persons or a thousand more, depriving me of the opportunity of listening to Judge Rutherford at such hours as happen to suit my convenience, which also happens to be during Canadian broadcasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, I can still hear the judge from across the line, and his talks are sufficiently interesting to move me to some effort in the matter of subjugating my own convenience for the sake of hearing him. But now there remains no incentive whatsoever to listening in on Canadian stations, and I should therefore like my two dollars paid for a radio license refunded, as I am not receiving value for money paid out. I shall expect your remittance by return mail.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>“Of Tremendous Importance”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Since his departure from the sanctum of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night</span><span class="font6"> that paper seems to have materially improved. This is as we would expect, for we cannot imagine a human activity with which Hector Charlesworth could be connected that would not be uplifted somewhat by his departure from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its issue of January 28, 1933, on its “Front Page”, appears the following editorial which at least has the good sense to admit something that the three canine frauds of St. John, N. B., Mr. Charlesworth, and some other Canadians do not understand, namely, that “the question of the censorship of the air is one of tremendous importance, and one which will have to be seriously considered at some time </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in the fairly near future’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RADIO AND CENSORSHIP PROBLEMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FEW Canadians, we imagine, will be greatly distressed at the news that the mellifluous voice of Judge Rutherford will no longer be transmitted from Canadian broadcasting stations until further inquiry has been made into the character of his utterances. The temporary banning of an entirely non-Canadian broadcast, sent out by an organization which has on previous occasions been under grave suspicion of antisocial tendencies, is not a serious matter. It is, however, very important that we should know in whose hands will rest the ultimate decision concerning not only Judge Rutherford but also any other broadcaster whose utterances may incur the disapproval of clergymen, statesmen or other influential persons in particular parts of this Dominion. The question of the censorship of the air is one of tremendous importance, and one which will have to be seriously considered at some time in the fairly near future, and it might well be linked up with the whole question of censorship in other fields of communication, which is in an extremely unsatisfactory condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">» * * •</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Haste of the Pickpocket</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It is quite natural that when a pickpocket has a job he should move with considerable rapidity lest he be caught; but if caught and brought into court, even the proverbial Philadelphia lawyer would hesitate to stand at the bar in his defense and try to solemnly say: “The question of picking the pockets of owners of radio broadcasting stations is one of tremendous importance, and one which will have to be seriously considered at some time </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">in the fairly near future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The time to consider it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">now.</span><span class="font6"> If Mr. Charlesworth wanted to have this matter looked into in an honest, upright way, why did he not have public hearings where all could have their say and Judge Rutherford could have an opportunity to answer his accusers? There has been nothing straightforward about the whole procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A great wrong has been done by this narrowminded censor. Our last issue suggests that he is probably a liar. That is quite reasonable, for anyone that will steal will lie, and in taking away from the owners of Canadian broadcasting stations the privilege of broadcasting Judge Rutherford’s lectures, Hector Charlesworth seems to us to have shown that he is to all intents and purposes a thief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the Canadian stations sent Mr. Charlesworth a telegram stating, in effect, that “while we do not agree fully with Judge Rutherford’s talks, we have failed to find anything of anti-social or communistic nature. The tenor of his broadcast is directed against other forms of religion and extolling his own creed which we would call fundamentalism. We believe we should accept broadcasts of all nature in the interests of free speech as long as they do not conflict with democratic government. In these times </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the loss of revenue is a hardship upon us.”</span><span class="font6"> Supplementing this telegram the station called up Mr. Charlesworth to get permission to continue the broadcast for at least two weeks anyway, and the answer was, “Not a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It thus appears that a man who could write or approve such an article as the one entitled “Visiting Orators Take Notice” has been employed to defend the interests of the Anglican and other clergy of Canada against all comers. They need such a defender, being entirely unable themselves to meet and to answer Judge Rutherford’s challenge that they are the employees of their father the Devil and doing his work in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyhow, Hector Charlesworth is now entitled also to wear a lace skirt and to put his collar on backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Are the Canadian people going to stand for this; and if so, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreclosure Lawyers in Danger</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font6">N A RIOT at Lemars, Iowa, a wealthy foreclosure lawyer came near losing his life at the hands of a gathering of hard-working dirt farmers who felt that he had been too brusque, provocative and contemptuous in his treatment of a farmer who had paid $40,000 on a property, which was more than it was worth, and then finally lost it all because he could not pay the interest on the $33,000 still due. The farmers dragged the fat lawyer backward down eighteen stone steps, overpowered sheriff and deputies, and only the wise counsel of older men prevented a tragedy. Now the state of Iowa is considering the revision of some of the foreclosure laws, which it should have done long ago. Before they get through with it, all the people in the world that have been living selfishly and cruelly are going to regret it. A man who makes his living buying property at delinquent tax sales and foreclosing properties so as to squeeze out hard-working farmers is in the Devil’s own business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But They Would Not Do It Here</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font6">IFTEEN prominent churchmen, representing seven denominations, recently made a nine months’ study of foreign missions. One of the things they recommend is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the changes that are most often referred to by Christian leaders in the several countries as urgently needed if the church is to become an adequate organ of spiritual life, the one that would certainly come first would be a change away from sectarianism, and a narrow dcnominationalism, and in the direction of complete Christian cooperation. Missionaries who are to go out in the future ought to leave all their sectarian baggage behind and go out to work for a unified Christianity and a universal church. But much more than that is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only thing about this recommendation that bothers us is that we now have 213 denominations in this country, and how does it come that only seven of them were represented in an important recommendation like this ? Probably every one of the 213 would have signed up. But abandon their sects here at home? Not on your life.</span></p>

Just what it means to be “anchored within the vail”, where nothing can break in to disturb your slumbers, not even so much as an idea, becomes apparent when one reflects on the full significance of the following letter, which Mr. Mansfield wrote to one of Jehovah’s witnesses who thought to honor Jehovah’s name by leaving in the institute a little information about God’s kingdom, the hope of the world:</span></p>

We are appealed to constantly for this kind of privilege by Bible and missionary societies, professional institutions such as dentists, doctors, lawyers, clothiers, etc., etc. This Institute has consistently fought exploitation of its guests, whether good or bad.

<p><span class="font5">Death of Helen May Oliver, 12 years old, 30-18 Lancaster street, whose parents alleged they were unable to obtain medical assistance from the City hospital, was being investigated yesterday by Dr. Charles W. Myers, superintendent of the institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The parents, Dr. Myers said, apparently did not realize the gravity of the child’s condition. An aunt of the child, Mrs. Elsie Poliquin, 3058 Lancaster street, called the hospital by telephone Tuesday afternoon and was told, she said, that a physician could not be sent until the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">She called again at 6: 30 o’clock and after describing the child’s symptoms, was instructed what treatment to administer and told if no improvement was noted to call again and a physician would be sent, Dr. Myers said. He also declared no other call was received regarding the girl after that until she died at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font5">o’clock yesterday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mrs. Poliquin asserted that she called the hospital early yesterday before the child died and informed the person she talked with that the case had reached an emergency stage. She then called police and when Radio Patrolmen Mangus and Yates arrived the child was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An autopsy by Dr. John E. Wyttenbach, deputy coroner, revealed that the child died of peritonitis which had resulted from appendicitis and a ruptured stomach. The child became ill Monday and it was at first believed that she was suffering an ordinary ‘’stomach ache”. Other members of the family also became ill, it was said, after eating beans with which meat was cooked. The child’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Oliver, and the family depend upon the township trustee for support. Oliver has been without employment for some time. There are four other children, John, 10; Virginia, 5; Junior, 3; and Rosemary, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font5">months old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A visit was made at this home the day following the funeral of this twelve-year-old girl. The only cooking utensil in the home was a perforated aluminum kettle in which the food of this family was prepared. Another of the family nearly died.

I purchased some good graniteware to take the place of the wretched, worn-out kettle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Brooklyn pays double the average rates of more than twenty metropolitan districts. For thirty years Brooklyn Edison Company has enjoyed full 8-percent dividends, panics and depressions included. Brooklyn citizens paid the bill! Ten years ago Edison dividends were $1,400,000 a year.

This Mission does not compel men to work for their meals and bed, and then publish that this service ‘was given’, and then put its hand in the Community Chest; does not park on the street corners under a special begging license for public help, and then appeal to the Community Chest for funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“While thousands of men, women and children in and about Pasadena are in dire need, but respectable citizens, many thousands of dollars are being spent here in Pasadena through charity agencies that do not touch this greatest need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Samples of such expenditures: No. 1. ‘Conducts summer vacation camps at Catalina Island.’ No. 2. ‘Constructive leisure-time activities, especially out-of-doors.’ No. 3. ‘Conducts summer camps in the San Bernardino National Forest.’ No. 4. ‘Training in correct use of leisure time, and conducts camps at Camp Duquesne, Big Pines.’ No. 5. ‘Teaching service to others, and promoting world peace by assisting children to exchange letters and portfolios with children in nineteen other countries.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And yet in the face of what seems to us needless squandering of charity funds the Union Mission, which has been turned down by the Community Chest, has served about 5,000 meals to needy men, women and children in the last 37 days, and 140,000 meals in the past six years. But the Mission is told by the Chest that it does not qualify, while the interests carrying out these wonderful summer frolics, and other nonessentials, qualify. The second-hand charity goods organization also qualifies.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Thou Shalt Not Kill” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Keith B. Phillips</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(This editorial which appeared in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror,</span><span class="font4"> suggests to us that Mr. Phillips has been reading Judge</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Rutherford’s books or at least</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is is an editorial addressed to the young J- man who asked for an opinion of clergy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">men who preached young men into the World War when one of God’s commandments is ‘Thou shalt not kill’. I use the Word of God as my authority in denouncing the clergy, and defy them to get around it in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If the young man will take his Bible and read John 8:44, he will find his answer, for it says, We are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Now are not these same clergy that preached ‘Kill!’ in the World War murderers; were they not pursuing the lusts of their father, who was a murderer from the beginning? And note well that it labels the Devil a liar and the father of it. The clergy of today get up in their pulpits and say ‘There is no death. Death is a continuation of life.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Did not Satan say, ‘Thou shalt not surely die,’ in the very teeth of God’s statement, ‘Thou shalt surely die’? The clergy claim to represent </span><span class="font4">listening to his radio talks.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s kingdom upon earth, but are actually servants of the Devil, as set forth in John 8: 44, as quoted above. Christ charged the clergy of His day as being like ‘whited sepulchres’, and ‘a generation of vipers’. How truly that pictures the clergy of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When God cast Israel from Him and permitted the Gentile nations to rule the earth, many of these nations adopted a religion and called it ‘Christian’. The men who rule the nations today are anything but followers of Christ. Christ Jesus is the ‘Prince of Peace’. He restated His Father’s commandment, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ When the World War came these so-called Christian nations not only indulged in that war, but enacted laws compelling young men to go to war and kill each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the face of these facts, can you believe that God listens to the prayers of these leaders who knelt before going to battle to do the very things He commanded them not to do? I have no doubt that if any of the clergy will answer this they will say ‘It’s a lot of piffle’. But I’ll remind them that they are referring to the Word of God and not to me.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(From </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span><span class="font4"> of October 22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE National Socialists will change all</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">-L that,” a Nazi assured me one day. “They will restore German morality.” I asked how, but the answer was more verbose than factual. I did manage to glean from it, however, that the Nazis stood behind the churches; and indeed it is true that withdrawal from churches in Germany is becoming increasingly difficult. To do so in the town I know entails giving written and spoken reasons not only to one’s pastor but to a committee from the local government and to a responsible individual assigned by this committee to speak with the erring member by appointment. Follows a definite period on which to “think over” the matter, and finally, if the member<sup>-</sup> persists, permission is given, accompanied by release from the necessity of paying compulsory church taxes, but also by refusal to permit the withdrawn member ever to set foot within a church door again, even as a guest at a wedding. From this astonishing piece of compulsion hangs the phenomenon of empty churches all over the land, but a large membership list and wholly satisfactory financial returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(The foregoing is interesting because of the claimed intent of Fascism to spread itself over the world and to take over all government functions. Fascism is anarchy, backed by Big Business and in collusion with the church. It despises constitutions and the laws of the people.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The World like a Powder Magazine</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IN A PUBLIC address in South Wales in October, 1932, Lloyd George said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are more serious misunderstandings of the kind that make wars at this moment in every continent than I can ever recall in the whole of my life, and the organizations that not merely make war, but make for war, are more powerful and more potent than they ever were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were millions of people who faced all the horrors of war with inconceivable courage and fortitude, in July and August, 1914, and yet they could not find two men who had the courage to face the taunts and jeers which would have greeted them if they had tried to make peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I tell you that from my knowledge of the machinery of war it is more terrible than it was in 1914, when it very nearly wrecked civilization. War, always an assassin, has today become a poisoner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are today more quarrels among the nations than anyone can recall in human history. Today the nations are foolishly and feverishly preparing as though war were at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is going on in every country on earth. Great armaments are everywhere. Arsenals are working as though war were at hand and as if one could hear the rumble of the artillery approaching the battlefields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was one of the signatories to the Treaty of Versailles, one of the four framers. We incorporated in that Treaty disarmament proposals for Germany, but we also gave a guarantee to Germany that if she disarmed in accordance with the conditions of the Treaty we should follow her example. We have not done it. It is a shame. When that document was signed the majority of the signatories had no intention of carrying it out. Before the ink was dry they were making arrangements for creating new armies, and they have created them. Germany has the feeling she has been duped. She feels quite frankly that she has been deceived, cheated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League of Nations is today on the point of foundering. Germany demands general disarmament or German re-armament. France will agree to neither. Japan defies the world over Manchuria. Geneva twiddles its thumbs in despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Physical and Climatic Phenomena Characteristic of Southern Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By P. J. de Jager</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">N</span><span class="font6">OW that we are approaching the Zambezi and have the prospect of seeing the famous Victoria falls within less than a fortnight, my mind reverts to a description I read of the general formation of the continent of Africa and the resultant climatic and physical conditions prevailing in certain parts by the late Professor Schwarz of Grahamstown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Africa, for the most part, is a high plateau in the interior with low-lying strips of country along its coasts. The northern part of the continent is an exception. The result is that its rivers, generally, in their descent to the sea, dash down cataracts and waterfalls to get to sea level from their high source levels. Consequently few of them are navigable, and that, for the most part, only for short distances. As the plateau has an escarpment facing the coastline, the mountain ranges generally are different from the “folded” type of Europe. Only the Atlas mountains, in North Africa, prove an exception and belong to the Alpine group or folds, in their comparative neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anyone who has crossed the mountain ranges of South Africa, facing the sea, from the direction of the coast or the reverse direction, will be struck with how the ascent from west, south or east is steep and sharp, with only a slight descent on the opposite side. This is especially marked near Van Rhynsdorp on the west, and the Drakensbergen on the east, which divide Natal and Orange Free State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">South Africa (in the Cape province) has this further distinctive feature, that the ascent from south to north is three distinct terraces of plateaus separated from one another and from the coastal belt by three such escarpments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These mountain escarpments have this effect, viz., that the seasonal north-west and southeast winds beat against their coastal edges and, in rising, deposit most or all of their moisture on the coastal belts. The result is great periods of droughts from time to time in the interior, especially in the Karroo belts of the Cape province (which climatic and physical conditions the clergy of the country ignore when they urge the people to confess special guilt before God, which brought on these “visitations”, while their kinsfolk in the coastal belts, who no doubt are no better or more devoted to the Creator, get their rains in season practically without fail).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now Professor Schwarz maintained that this formation of Africa is responsible for its great deserts and for a general desiccating process which he claimed was in progress. Thus, for instance, he maintained that remnants of past vegetation in the Kalahari prove that it was not always the vast desert it now is. The Zambezi river, among others, gradually encroached on the waters that once flowed via the Kalahari inland lakes into the Orange river, which runs westward into the Atlantic ocean. The Zambezi now conveys them eastward with thunderous roar over the Victoria falls into the Indian ocean. Not only has the Kalahari been “robbed” thereby, but the northwester wind, which passes over the cold waters of the Antarctic Current along the west coast of southern Africa is not laden with overmuch moisture, on account of the low temperature. It deposits hardly any rain on the Namib desert, in southwestern Africa, the land surface being hotter than the air. When it rises to the highlands of southwestern Africa it does, as a rule, deposit some moisture, on account of the colder levels reached. In the days when the Kalahari lake system was bountifully fed by the heavy rains on the high plateau of south-central Africa, the wind in its further course received a fresh supply of moisture, which resulted in beneficent showers for the interior of southern Africa. Livingstone in his day still wrote of Lake Ngami as an inland sea, while now it is no more than a bed of marshy reeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now that the Zambezi has “robbed” these waters to carry them by course eastward, the result is a dry wind all along the way, and great drought periods for the interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Professor Schwarz maintained that by constructing a few comparatively small dams to check this flow of waters from the Kalahari the pristine water courses would again convey their supplies into the “saucer-like” formation of the desert region and neighborhood, with the resultant revival of the former water supplies there and an increase in the rainfall of South Africa. This he maintained would provide homes for the “poor whites” of South Africa and help to solve that problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has also been talk, and still is, among the natives in the neighborhood of Ngami, of opening up the silted water courses once feeding it and restoring the prosperity they knew when water was abundant there; for the Oko-vango river still flows into that region, but dissipates its waters along various channels. In flood seasons it sometimes overflows into the Zambezi. At times it also passes some of its waters into the Botletle river, which flows into the Makari-kari pan, the new center of the Kalahari water system. It sometimes happens, however, that the Makari-kari pan is fed by rivers in flood from the west when the Okovango is low. Then the Botletle becomes an outlet instead. This river, therefore, is an oddity, in that it flows alternately in either direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Closely related to the evident dislocation of the original flow of waters into the Kalahari is another peculiarity of the African continent, according to some recently advanced theories. It is believed that lakes Nyasa, Tanganyika, Edward and Albert, etc., lie in a great rift which is further traceable in what is commonly spoken of as the “Rift Valley'&quot; in Kenya, a crack in the African continent which extends northward through the Red sea and right into the Dead sea and Jordan valley. It has been further advanced that this great crack has caused a subsidence in the crust of the earth in south-central Africa which seriously dislocated the water system of the present Kalahari. Consequently the Chobe river, which it is believed once flowed through the Kalahari region into the Orange river to the south, has now become an important affluent of the Zambezi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No doubt the commission of 1926 considers the dislocation of the original water' system of the Kalahari on account of this probable subsidence mentioned above too serious to allow of an easy restoration of their original course as was believed in by Professor Schwarz.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font6">OGETHER with three other pioneers, I am witnessing in Rhodesia. Since our arrival from the Union, a week ago, we have encountered considerable difficulties. Today we were ordered before the police for trading without a license, and we are still awaiting developments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people here are pro-British and antiAmerican in the extreme, but sometimes I gently inquire where they got the Ford car from!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although I am only eighteen I have been a reader of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> for several years. I want also to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of it. I am confident that it is being used to give a mighty witness to the people. I am very grateful, too, for the health articles. Two of South Africa’s leading physical culturists are subscribers for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Winter has been long in coming this year, but has at last begun to make itself felt. In parts of the Union the natives have been existing almost entirely on prickly pears. They are now anticipating a miserable winter, as the prickly pears are now over. Poor creatures that they are, dirty and ragged, yet they appreciate the message of the Kingdom, showing joy and making humble statements of gratitude. Many are dishonest, but they have innocent hearts nevertheless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some of the Europeans in the villages are starving now and Europeans are being employed in roadmaking. The natives now lose their employment. They cannot understand “why the big white bosses are working in the roads”! To add to their misery they have to pay very unjust taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An American said: “We have a man with a wooden arm, and he’s a champion boxer!” A Britisher said: “Well, we have a man with a wooden leg, and he’s a champion swimmer!” The South African said: “We have a man with a wooden head, and he’s a prime minister!”</span></p>

High-caste Hindus have solemnly pledged themselves to stamp out untouchability in all its forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Clergy Crawl into Their Holes</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font6">HE following article, entitled “A Challenge”, from the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America Bulletin for December, 1932, is really pathetic because of its admission that the most capable ministers in the Anglo-Saxon Federation are afraid to meet Judge Rutherford in a world-wide radio debate as to whether or not the clergy are the clergy of the Devil. The judge insists that they are, and the silence of the big guns among the clergy, and of the organizations with which they are connected, is tacit admission that they know their best and only defense is to crawl into their holes and pull the holes in after them, as is done in the following article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A Challenge</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a shame that the pastors in Israel are not equipped to meet the attacks of Mr. J. F. Rutherford as he denounces them and all governments and rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a paper<sup>1</sup> distributed by his followers a challenge is issued to the clergy of America for debate. Jeremiah 51: 30 is quoted in this circular and applied to the pastors in Israel. But the prophet is here speaking of Babylon. Mr. Rutherford is deliberately misquoting Scripture, or is totally ignorant of the context from which this verse has been lifted. The reference to the Medes in the 28th verse certainly identifies the Babylon in this verse. Neither is there any justification for applying the historical happenings in Babylon to latter day events in Israel. To thus cross wires brings utter confusion. Let the things of Babylon testify of Babylon, but let the things of Israel testify to the happenings among His Kingdom people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This particular chapter of Jeremiah contains valuable information. Let Mr. Rutherford declare what is “the portion of Jacob” and “the rod of His inheritance” of vs. 19. In this same chapter the Lord says of Israel “Thou art my battle ax and weapons of war; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms, etc.” vs. 20-23. Let him show </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">where, when, how and by whom</span><span class="font5"> has all this been accomplished. Without spiritualizing away the plain meaning of God’s Word let him declare the literal fulfillment of these statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ignorant of the whereabouts of the Kingdom people; failing to understand the distinction between Israel and Judah, and the separate prophecies to each with the resulting diversified fulfillments, he and his followers, as well as the organized Church, arc stone blind to nine-tenths of the Scripture. Because of their blindness they are forced to spiritualize what they are unable to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Rutherford declares that his purpose in challenging the clergy of America to debate is that the people may know the truth. He assumes the silence on the part of the ministry is admission of their inability to meet in debate. Shall we assume the same regarding him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We challenge that in his teaching he misrepresents Scripture to attain his end; that he does not know or recognize the Kingdom; and that in his spiritualization of the recorded prophetical and historical facts of Scripture he makes the Bible of no effect in the twisting and turning of its plain meaning into fantastical interpretations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We wonder if he really means he desires that the people shall know the truth, or only his version of that truth? Does he confine his challenge to those whom he knows will not answer? Or will he extend it to others, who will be glad to meet him in debate?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> Number 204, issue of July 13, 1927, we printed a summary of what the Anglo-Israelites believe, and reprint it in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We sought to playfully show that, like the Heinz pickle business, fifty-seven arguments are advanced why it should continue to attract attention. The arguments are as good now as they ever were, but, of course, they never were of any good to anybody that has any common sense. However, they suit the mentality of the clergy very well, and, frankly, we are surprised that they have not more generally fallen for that line of sophistry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Probably they would flock to it by the thousands if they thought they could drag the people along with them, but the common people have too much intelligence to swallow anything that is so palpably foolish and absurd. The British Israel theory belongs to the days of Jack and the Beanstalk, Dante’s Inferno, Little Red Riding Hood, the Trinity doctrine, and Baron Munchausen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WHAT THE ANGLO-ISRAELITES BELIEVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WE HAVE just glanced over some of the recent literature of the Anglo-Israelites, and list some of the items that some of them believe. All of these things look like nonsense, sacrilege or blasphemy to us, but they seem reasonable enough to those who are thoroughly inoculated with idolatry of the British Empire. We present the matter merely as news, and as showing what some people can believe about the most rapacious, most diabolical, most hypocritical, diplomatic government now left standing on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the believers of this theory were or are Queen Victoria; Edward VII; Admiral Lord Beresford; Admiral Lord Fisher; Field-Marshal Earl Roberts; Rt. Hon. W. F. Massey, prime minister of New Zealand; Henry Ford, and thousands of other notables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do not attempt an orderly presentation, because to us an orderly presentation of a disorderly and absurd theory is a waste of time. We state, as nearly as we can understand them, some of the hundreds of claims put forth by adherents of this theory:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. The Anglo-Saxon peoples are, in a large measure, the direct descendants of the apostate ten tribes of Israel. So much the worse for them in some respects!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. There was a tribe of Dan, therefore we can trace the wanderings of that tribe in the following names: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Don, Danube,</span><span class="font5"> Denmark, Dinarie Alps, London, Dardanelles and Scandinavia. True, the other nine tribes may not be thus “identified”, but—what’s the difference? Perhaps they didn’t do so much wandering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. The name Saxon with an “I” in front of it becomes Isaacson. (This proves a lot if you want to make somebody think you are related in some way to Abraham 1)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. The British nation somehow was established at the date of the Exodus and will last for ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. Joseph! The tribe of Joseph became the Getae, the Goths, the Normans, and finally became ruler over the Angles, or Anglo-Saxons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">6. Ephraim! Ephraim was to be a nation and a company of nations; so, of course, that means Great Britain and her self-governing colonies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">7. Manasseh! Manasseh was to be a great people, a second fiddle to Ephraim, so to speak; so, of course, that means the United States, which, for the purposes of this theory, is still a sort of colony of Great Britain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">8. The House of David was imported to Ireland by Jeremiah in the person of Tamar Tephi, the daughter of Zedekiah. While there Tamar married a king of Ireland named Eochiad Heremon, and thence they have a complete list of the line of kings of Ireland, leading through to the Scottish kings, thence to the English kings when James VI of Scotland became James I of England, and, of course, thence to the present day; and now there is only one true Israel, and that is Great Britain and Ireland. (God help the real Jews!)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">9. The present prince of Wales is just exactly the 100th prince in direct succession from King David, and his name happens to be David, too. Could anything be more convincing?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">10. There is nothing in the word Gog that sounds very much like Russia, but still it must be Russia, because in connection with Gog there is mention made of—</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">11. Roseh! That is Russia. Sounds like it, especially if you can imagine the Russian partly tanked up with vodka.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">12. Mesheeh! Well, that is Moscow. There are an M and an S and a C in each word, and that proves it!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">13. Tubal! That is Tobolsk. There happens to be a little town far up in Siberia by that name and, except for the whiskers on the back end of the word, they arc about the same; so that proves </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">14. Gomer! There are a G, an M, an E and an R in Gomer, and there are a G, an E, an R and an M in Germany; and so, of course, Gomer means Germany.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">15. There are the four attributes of God, justice, power, wisdom and love. These are represented by the lion, ox, eagle and man. The lion is the British lion, shown in one way or another ten times on the British eoat of arms.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">16. The ox! Now, don’t laugh. That is John </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. </span><span class="font5">Honest!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">17. The eagle! Modesty almost forbids our mentioning it, but that is the eagle shown on all American coins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">18. The man! Ah! We feel like Lindbergh when they pinned the cross of the Legion of Honor on his chest and kissed him on both cheeks. The man! That’s us. That’s Uncle Sam. And our kiss? What about that? Oh, we got that Judas kiss in the spring of 1917. It was Britain that got us into the World War.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">19. The unicorn of Ephraim? That is the identical unicorn shown on the British seal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">20. Young lions are mentioned in Bible prophecy. Well, those are the United States and Scandinavia. We don’t know why it is so; but it is so, anyway.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">21. The original symbol of the Christian Church (of the House of Dagon) was a fish. That is why the fish is shown on the Union Jack. Poor fish!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">22. The British flag is the banner of the King of kings. See the cross on it. (What a blasphemy!)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">23. David’s throne is the English throne. (Another horrible blasphemy.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">24. Christ will literally reign over the earth seated, in a body of flesh, on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">British</span><span class="font5"> throne. (Can you beat it?)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">25. The Coronation Stone upon which every British king is crowned is the same identical one on which King David sat when he was crowned. There couldn’t be any mistake about this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">26. “The strong man armed who keepeth his house ” is the great war power, Great Britain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">27. ‘‘ The Isles shall wait for his law. ’ ’ What isles ? British Isles, of course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">28. “Declare it in the Isles afar off.” What isles? Ditto.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">29. The missing “H” in Shibboleth is the reason why the Cockneys drop their H’s. Honest! Don’t smile! See the Bible, Judges 12: 6, and be convinced.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">30. Why were there thirteen tribes of Israel? The answer is that there were thirteen colonies in the original United States.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">31. But wait; here’s another thirteen. President Wilson was reelected in 1916 by the thirteen votes of California. Almost forgot that was in the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">32. It was on Good Friday that President Wilson declared war on Germany. That proves that God loves the ten lost tribes! And yet, Germany, or part of it, was one of those tribes. But, oh well—</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">33. The Great Pyramid shows the precise day that Britain entered the World War!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">34. ‘The hour, the day, the month and the year.’ That is 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month, 1918, when Britain got out of her tightest corner and the armistice was declared. Of course the day is missing in the Sinaitic text, and the year is missing in the explanation, but what are a few broken cogs between true Britishers?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">35. The British Government is ‘the stone cut out of the mountain without hands’ which breaks in pieces her enemies, Russia, Germany, China, Persia, and the whole Mohammedan world in Asia and Africa.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">36. The “stone” kingdom smote the military image in 1914-1918. (And there has been no evidence of militarism on earth since!)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">37. General Allenby took Jerusalem on Christmas Day. Another proof that God loves the greatest disturber of the world’s peace ever on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">38. The drying up of the Euphrates means the drying up of the Turkish Empire by Britain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">39. The Court of St. James is the Court of St. Jacob, if you translate it into Hebrew, which shows again that somehow or other the British Government is related to Abraham.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">40. When Jacob crossed his hands in blessing Ephraim and Manasseh that proves that both Ephraim (Britain) and Manasseh (United States) are true Christians—if it docs. Does it? Who says it does? It proves </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">something,</span><span class="font5"> anyway.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">41. “The drunkards of Ephraim.” (Isaiah 28:1) That refers to those who are overfond of British beer and Scotch and Irish whiskey. Why not?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">42. Israel was to be superabundantly blessed with gold, silver, oil, etc. That is why the great financiers of “Ephraim” and “Manasseh” are grabbing everything in sight in every corner of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">43. ‘ ‘ Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. ’ ’ That explains why Britain has Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, Singapore, and a hundred other gates controlling the world’s commerce; and why Uncle Sam has Panama, Hawaii, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">44. Israel must not take usury from brethren. That is why Uncle Sam should let Britain have money at a low rate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">45. Israel was to lend and not borrow. That is why Britain and the United States have the whole world by the throat, as money lenders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">46. Israel was to “push the people together to the ends of the earth”. That is why Britain and the United States are cruel and imperialistic. (Not so bad. If all the arguments were as good as this one we would be stumped. But then, if Britain is Christ’s kingdom—oh well, we give it up.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">47. Israel was to spread to the north (Canada), and to the south (Australia and South Africa), to the east (India) and to the west (the United States). That’s that.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">48. After a little bit there will be another World War, in which Europe in general will line up under a supreme ruler, the Antichrist; and then the two pious and godly nations will unite and clean them all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font5"> the map.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">49. When the final scrimmage comes on between Britain and Russia, God will destroy the Russians with hailstones, fire and brimestone (if the Britishers themselves don’t do it with poison gas, microbes and bombs).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">50. The Great Pyramid shows that the great and final battle of Armageddon will start on May 29-30, 1928. (The prophet slipped a cog.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">51. The Pyramid Inch is the British Inch. Of course the British inch is a little off; but why worry about the thousandth part of an inch when you are trying to prove something that is impossible to prove ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">52. The coffer in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid is four times greater than the British wheat quarter. That proves that, Great Britain, her stock exchange and all, is of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">53. Any criticism of Britain is Bolshevism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">54. The British Empire is eight times that of the Persian Empire under Darius; seven times that of the Roman Empire under Augustus; three times that of China; twice that of Russia, and three and one-half times that of all Europe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">55. Free Masonry is all in line with all of this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">56. The British flag flies from three-fourths of all the vessels in the world, and three-fourths of all the mail is addressed in English. Does not that prove something? We don't know what it proves, but it proves it anyway.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">57. Finally, English-speaking missionaries are ninety percent of the total, and English-speaking peoples supply ninety-five percent of the missionary funds to teach the natives of subjugated races that their ancestors have gone to hell, there to roast for ever and ever.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">These are some of the principal reasons assigned to prove that the British people are the true Israel of God. If these arguments do not prove it, nothing will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AND NOTHING </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">WILL!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>In Only Two Years</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Two years is a very short time in the history of the British Government, but let us tell you some of the things that are chargeable to it in that period, which all must acknowledge to have been one of the most humane and enlightened and kind in all its history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In that period, in Kenya, British East Africa, 11,000 men were forced to work 108,000 days without pay. This forced labor was exacted as a tax. A tax for what? The natives live right where they have lived for centuries. The only difference for them now is that all their best lands have been taken from them. They can live only where the whites say they must, but if gold is found in the territory reserved for them, then the white man takes the land anyway, and the native is moved to another place, if there is such a place. Anyway, he is moved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That is in British East Africa. In British West Africa (Nigeria) a native who does not take off his hat when he meets a British official has it knocked off. In British Central Africa (Northern Rhodesia), where his fathers lived as freemen, the native is now a tenant and must do as he is told, under penalty of feeling the sting of the dreaded whip made of rhinoceros hide. In British South Africa a native must have a pass to live with his wife, and dare not be off his reservation without it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the Gold Coast the native chiefs have besought the British Government to keep out the rum which is ruining the people, but, as the dignitaries in the Church of England are among the heaviest stockholders in Britain’s distilleries, there is nothing doing in the way of cuttingdown on the importations of rum. Does a miserable heathen, and a black man at that, suppose that a Christian distiller is going to have his profits reduced? The same crowd, by the same method, destroyed the aborigines of Tasmania.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>In Samoa, Australia, India and Palestine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In western Samoa a civilized and cultured population of 40,000 of fine physical and mental development has been hunted and harried like wild beasts by Britishers from New Zealand, culminating in the cold-blooded shooting of their chiefs after an administration replete with tyranny, persecution and callous brutality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 60,000 aborigines left in Australia, instead of being lifted up by their conquerors, have been reduced to the most pitiful poverty imaginable. Their best lands having been taken, they live on anything they can pick up, from wild honey to snakes. When cut off from their elaborately organized tribal life and employed by the imported Anglo-Israelites they are entirely helpless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The average British official in India despises all Hindus, bullies, beats, flogs and mutilates them, curses them on the roads, berates them obscenely in shops and public places, drinks heavily, gambles, makes love to other men’s wives, and boasts of the outrageous abuse which he heaps upon the inhabitants. To take an Indian’s part in India is to bring down on one’s own head suspicion, ostracism and official rebuke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In India at the moment there are 50,000 political prisoners, and the British army in India has been brought up to its full strength of 68,900 white officers and men, and 155,300 Indian troops and officers. In the British equipment in India there are eleven armored-car companies each of which is equipped with twenty armored cars of the latest type. The Hindu people have to bear all this vast and intolerable burden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After some college students had shouted “Cowards!” at police in Calcutta who were beating participants in a peaceful procession, an English officer, accompanied by a squad of police, entered the classrooms and beat the students indiscriminately until the Avails were spattered with blood. A similar scene took place at Lahore, Avhere a teacher also Avas beaten. At Meerut a leading lawyer was the chief speaker at a dispersed meeting. While under arrest he was beaten, and was shot at close range by a policeman, so that his right arm had to be amputated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The promise was made by Mr. Balfour that the Jews should have Palestine as their own homeland. Within the past two years this promise was repudiated and all the principal Jewish leaders of Zionism resigned in discouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Land of Ephraim (?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England itself the so-called Mole’ is the only thing that stands between 2,714,359 English men and women and starvation. In Wallasey 68 men cast lots to see which should have the privilege of two jobs that opened up in an electric power station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 100,000 British railway workers that receive less than $12.50 per week, but that is probably all O.K. with the Anglo-Israelites so long as their king and the prince of Wales each receive some $40,000 to $50,000 a week. At Merthyr, Wales, 25 percent of the school children remain away from school in midwinter because they have no shoes; 170 families of the city live in cellars, and 900 occupy houses that were condemned long ago as unfit for human habitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Britain still imprisons the poor for debt; imprisonment for debt has been abolished only for the well-to-do. Britain also jails others of the innocent. In recent years 8,000 men and women, many of them scarcely more than boys and girls, were detained in Britain, pending trial, only to be discharged by juries, free of blame or reproach. Meantime they sometimes spent as much as two months in prison before their cases were called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Though Britain is the biggest toad at every peace conference, everybody knows that she will no more give up Egypt, Palestine or India than the United States will give up the West Indies or Central America. She signs every peace pact and has air craft that are armored and fly 120 miles an hour equipped with torpedoes and machine guns of the most approved Anglo-Israelitish construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Great Britain, in a single year, there were 209,014 vivisections in which dumb animals were tortured by the most refined and excruciating methods that educated men could devise. British insane asylums are centers of physical and verbal filth and greed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a land where more than 2,000,000 are employed there are more than 12,000,000 acres of arable land held out of use because the most approved Anglo-Israelites hold title to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are thousands of farmers in England today that have to give a tenth of all their produce to Anglo-Israelitish persons who have never done anything for them or for anybody else, and whose only excuse foi’ reception of it is that it comes to them as a result of an order made four hundred years ago by England’s often-married monarch, Henry VIII.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>In the Land of Manasseh (?)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In New York city we can show you the most wonderful sky line in the world, and you can’t get to a railroad train without being stopped several times on the way by starving men who have learned to hope that a man with a satchel may possibly have an extra nickel in his pocket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We can show you bridges unequaled in the world, 100 bread lines, and suicides running into the thousands. We have a transportation system which enables one to get all over this huge city for a nickel, and we often have people die of starvation in this show-place of Anglo-Saxondom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In other cities we can take you to hundreds of beautiful homes, beautifully furnished, where the head of the home has not done a stroke of work in three years, the home and all it contains is lost, and the family is on relief and allowed to remain on because to put somebody else in the home would make no change in the conditions. In seventeen calls in one city, recently, practically every home in two blocks was in this condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We don't want to boast, but we have everything here that any Anglo-Saxon could want. We have billionaires, and we have little girls fainting from weakness while trying to reach a schoolhouse where milk is doled out; we have families trying to live on berries; we have babies three or four years old that have never known what it is to have enough to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We would have you understand that in this land of billion-dollar deficits we have millions of men out of work, but we think nothing of having six or seven hundred war planes flying around over the country at a daily expense of a fabulous sum, and if money for another war were wanted the big financiers could supply it over night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that we have the worst murder rate in the world. In Memphis there are more than ten times as many murders per thousand of population as there are in Moscow, but the Anglo-Israelite looks forward hopefully to the time when the pure-blooded Anglo-Saxons of Tennessee will destroy the Muscovites and exalt their own standard of the Union Jack to fly in every corner of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meantime, in that same Tennessee, in one of the state prisons, we still handcuff women and hang them from pegs. If the thing happened in Russia we Anglo-Saxons would arise </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">en masse </span><span class="font6">to put an end to such barbarities; but, it happening here in The land of Manasseh’, and at the hands of the purest Anglo-Saxons we have in the United States, we don’t want anything said about it; not a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kingdom of the Devil</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing are some of the cruel, hideous and wicked things practiced by the rulers of the British Empire, which claims to be the kingdom of God ruling by divine right. It is that same great power of which America forms a part that claims to teach the Bible and represent God’s Word and calls itself “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy of denominations, including the Anglo-Saxon Federation, supports with approval that empire and serves it. Every sane person who believes in what is right well knows that such cruelty, injustice and wickedness does not proceed from Jehovah God, but is truly the product of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergy claim to be servants of Jehovah God, and so pose before the people. Judge Rutherford charges that they serve the Devil, and offers to prove it in a national radio debate. The clergy decline to accept the challenge. It is patent on the face of the facts that the British Empire is the chief nation of the world and is a part of the world, and that the Devil is its god, as stated in 2 Corinthians 4: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil has certainly blinded its clergymen as well as those of the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America or Anglo-Israelites. It is easy for the people to see that the clergy do not represent Jehovah God and that they do represent the Devil; therefore let the people forsake the devilish thing and give their allegiance to Jehovah and His kingdom under Christ, which is the only hope of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Anglo-Israelites or Anglo-Saxon Federation of America deny that Jesus Christ is the Son of Jehovah God, the Redeemer of mankind, Jehovah’s Chief Executive Officer, the King of kings, and that His kingdom will deliver the human race from oppression and give the obedient ones life. That they are instruments of the Devil there cannot be the slightest doubt; hence a debate with them would be a waste of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Unscientific Medical Science </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By E. Neal (Alberta)</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font6">N THE fall of 1930 my daughter, aged nine years, took ill after a throat operation for tonsils. She had a high fever and complained of pains in her legs. When she tried to walk, after being confined to bed about a month, she had a peculiar limp in her walk. I was then informed that she had infantile paralysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I got in touch with the university hospital and was promised a bed for her as soon as there was a vacant one. We waited only seven months before we got one. She was put in a cast and lay in bed nine months, when she was allowed to return home with her leg in irons and straps, for a period of three months, with a list of don’ts and instructions. At the end of three months I took her back for an examination. The report was not favorable, but I was told to try another three months’ rest at home. At the end of that time I again took her to be examined by specialists at the university and was told they did not understand why she was gradually getting worse, as she was getting a curve in the spine and the shoulders were dropping. All they could do was to operate (experiment) and find out what was causing the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I refused to have the muscles cut as they wished, and came home feeling pretty blue. As a child of our heavenly King I took my troubles to Him in prayer, because I know He loves to answer. Not many days passed before I took her to an osteopath. His examination revealed that her hip was out of place and had paralyzed the muscles. After a few treatments she was able to return to school, and the limp is gradually disappearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I cannot understand why the medical men refuse to investigate and to make use of modern methods of mechano-therapy, when it would save so much of human life and happiness, and be of such advantage to all concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience Brings Help in Time of Need</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font6">T CAN be set down as certain that nobody will ever be granted the boon of everlasting life until he has finally come to the place where he submits, and wishes to submit, to the will of Jehovah God. When he gets to that place he may still make slips, this way and that, and he will make them as long as he is in the flesh and the powers of evil are still rampant, but he thenceforth has an unfailing fountain of wisdom, justice, love and power with which he is vitally connected, and upon which he may draw with implicit confidence that it will never run dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We consider today some of the experiences in the life of a man who occasionally got himself into tight corners. We bring most of our difficulties upon ourselves, through failure to understand, or to remember, or to apply the principles set down for us in the Scriptures. This man was like that, but because at heart he was obedient to God, and desired to know and do His will, he was granted some of the most remarkable deliverances on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now it may be that you never make any errors such as the good king Jehoshaphat made, and if so, you need not consider this subject any further, but if you are like most of the rest of us you can well afford to take a little time pondering the experiences of this man, and noting what he did and what happened to him when he got into several tight places.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>The Right Kind of King</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Before we consider any of Jehoshaphat’s foibles let us get acquainted with some of his official acts, which show his devotion to the doing of God’s will, for those are the spectacles through which the events of his life are to be seen if we wish to draw from them the great lesson they contain. At the very outset of his career as king it says of him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And [Jehovah] was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; but sought to [Jehovah] God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. Therefore [Jehovah] stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. And his heart was lifted up in the ways of [Jehovah] : moreover, he took away the high places and groves out of Judah. ALso, in the third year of his reign, he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of [Jehovah] with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.—2 Chron. 17: 3-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, isn’t that pretty good? Here is a king that sought Jehovah God, and walked in His commandments, and had the joy of Jehovah in his heart, and saw to it that the most important and influential men in the realm should get out from city to city, and from town to town, and probably from house to house, with the Word of God, so that the people would know what was right and what was wrong, and be able to shape their lives accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It almost makes us feel that we wish we had somebody like that at Washington, doesn’t it? Jehoshaphat was not trying to find out what the princes wanted, or what he could do to curry favor with the Levites and the priests. He made the whole outfit pack their kits and get out in the service work, whether they liked it or didn’t like it. Their job was not merely to draw their salaries with their breath and ride around on the backs of the common people, trying to figure out some way by which they could have things come more easily for themselves, while all the time it was getting harder for the common people. Their business was to serve Jehovah God, and the way they should do it was to get around from door to door and teach the people the truth. Actually, though at first they may not have realized it, the big fellows in the realm got a bigger kick out of life doing the right thing than they would have doing the reverse. When it says of Jehoshaphat that because of these things “his heart was lifted up in the ways of [Jehovah]” it means just what it says. He was happy from the inside out, the kind of happiness that invigorates the whole heart, mind, soul and body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Obedience Then Brought Earthly Prosperity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In those days, under the law covenant then in force, earthly prosperity also accompanied obedience and the succeeding verses go on to tell how Jehoshaphat was prospered. We can pass briefly over that, noting briefly that there was peace with surrounding nations; they gave him tribute; castles and storehouses were multi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">plied; there was &quot;much business in the cities of Judah” (2 Chron. 17:13), and the roster of the army showed that on short notice 1,160,000 mighty men of valor were ready to take the field. In this interval of careful attention to the Word of the Lord, the account says, &quot;Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly.”—Verse 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It often happens that prosperity is a greater test than adversity, and it seems to have been so with Jehoshaphat, for it was not long before he came under the blandishments of Ahab, king of Israel, and was persuaded to join troops with him in a campaign against the Syrians. Jehoshaphat was guileless, but Ahab was as crooked as Ivar Kreuger, and no doubt had in mind to get Jehoshaphat killed and then make himself king over both nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ahab “Framed” Jehoshaphat</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The account telling of Ahab’s duplicity is interesting to us now, however, not only because of the very palpable fraud which he practiced upon his trusting friend, but because of what happened to Jehoshaphat in his hour of peril, and what happened, reversely, to the traitor himself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went to the battle. Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and [Jehovah] helped him; and God moved them to depart from him. For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him. And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the sun going down he died. And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. — 2 Chron. 18:29-34; 19:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ahab tried to get Jehoshaphat killed, but got killed himself, while Jehoshaphat escaped without a scratch. It was a remarkable deliverance, and it came, we can be sure of it, because of that cry. It is not at all likely that a group of armed men bent on conquest and seeking the most conspicuous figure on the battlefield would turn back because the one they had surrounded asked them not to harm him. His presence on the battlefield was an advertisement that he was there to kill or to be killed, or both.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>The Cry for Help</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The story is in very condensed form. It does not tell of what his cry consisted, but the effect of the cry was that Jehovah God helped Jehoshaphat and moved his attackers to desist. The cry, because of its effect, we know to have been a prayer to Jehovah God, and so received at the throne of heavenly grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehoshaphat, when he realized that he had made a mistake, and that the blessing of the Lord was not on his enterprise with Ahab, cried out for help and for forgiveness, and received both. Quite likely those who pursued him were given such optical impressions as to convince them that he was not the man they desired. His speedy deliverance followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jehoshaphat returned he was given some authentic information, straight from headquarters, and turned it to good account forthwith :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Jehu, the son of Hanani the seer, went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate [Jehovah] ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before [Jehovah]. Nevertheless, there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>More Steps in Good Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people, from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto [Jehovah] God of their fathers. And he set judges in the land, throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city. And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for [Jehovah], who is with you in the judgment. Wherefore now, let the fear of [Jehovah] be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with [Jehovah] our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. Moreover, in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of [Jehovah], and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of [Jehovah], faithfully, and with a perfect heart. And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against [Jehovah], and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass. And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of [Jehovah]; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and [Jehovah] shall be with the good.—2 Chron. 19: 2-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God pursues with His creatures a course of liberty, instruction, opportunity, warning and judgment, and in his reign Jehoshaphat seems to have followed the divine program. After the people had for years been doing about as they pleased, there came the campaign of instruction which we have before noted; then followed years of opportunity, followed up by this campaign of warning and judgment which has so endeared Jehoshaphat to all students of the Scriptures and of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not in our own time, and not in any other time, have members of the judiciary, both the lower branches and the supreme court, been inaugurated into office more solemnly, or with sounder words of warning and encouragement than Jehoshaphat used in the language above quoted. Even the provincial judges were reminded that they were judging for Jehovah God, with whom there is no injustice, nor respect of persons, nor acceptance of bribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this point we mention that the name “Jehoshaphat” means “Jehovah-judged, i.e., vindicated”, and the thought at once arises in the mind that his experiences were intended to be of special value to us in this day when this vindication is proclaimed and is confidently expected shortly to occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Appeal to Elisha</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A second tight corner in Jehoshaphat’s career came in the reign of Jehoram, son of Ahab, about four years after the disastrous battle with the Syrians. The Moabites had rebelled against paying tribute to Ahab’s descendants, and so Jehoram, wanting to invade their country, proposed another joint military campaign; and Jehoshaphat, having learned nothing by experience, fell in with the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following their plan, the armies of Jehoram and Jehoshaphat moved upon Moab via the land of Edom, at the south end of the Dead sea, a most forbidding country to travel in, but at that time tributary to Jehoshaphat. The armies got into a district where they were seven days without water and all were likely to die. At the critical moment Jehoshaphat learned of the presence of Elisha in the neighborhood and went to him for help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word of Jehovah came to Elisha, assuring them of abundance of water, and of a subsequent victory, all of which came true, and further, Elisha gave Jehoram, the son of Ahab, the following straight-from-the-shoulder message as to just why the deliverance would occur:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. . . . As [Jehovah] of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.—2 Ki. 3:13,14.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Moabites Sought Revenge</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The third tight corner into which Jehoshaphat came was about five years after this last-mentioned event, and this time the shoe was on the other foot. It was not Jehoshaphat’s army that was cooperating in the invasion of another land, but it was his own land that was invaded by the very people he had last joined to attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Moabites, wanting vengeance, induced their kindred, the Ammonites, to join them, obtained auxiliaries from the Syrians, and drew over the Edomites, so that the strength of all the neighboring nations was united in one great enterprise. The allied forces entered the land of Judah and encamped at Engedi, near the western border of the Dead sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And because there is no language more beautiful than that of the Scriptures, we give the rest of the story just as it occurs in Holy Writ:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek [Jehovah], and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of [Jehovah]; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek [Jehovah], And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of [Jehovah], before the new court, and said:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Jehoshaphat’s Model Prayer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">0 [Jehovah] God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever? And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help. And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. 0 our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And all Judah stood before [Jehovah], with their little ones, their wives, and their children. Then upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the spirit of [Jehovah] in the midst of the congregation; and he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat; Thus saith [Jehovah] unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of [Jehovah] with you, 0 Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them; for [Jehovah] will be with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Jehoshaphat bowed his head, with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before [Jehovah], worshipping [Jehovah] . And the Levites of the children of the Kohath-ites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise [Jehovah] God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, 0 Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in [Jehovah] your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>“The Battle Is Not Yours”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto [Jehovah], and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise [Jehovah]; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, [Jehovah] set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah [blessing, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin]; </span><span class="font5">for there they blessed [Jehovah] : therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day. Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for [Jehovah] had made them to rejoice over their enemies. And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets, unto the house of [Jehovah]. And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that [Jehovah] fought against the enemies of Israel. So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about. —2 Chron. 20:3-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus we see how in the life of this obedient man, the king Jehoshaphat, he got into serious trouble on three different occasions and on each one of them obtained help in his time of need because he knew to come to the throne of heavenly grace and ask for it. He had a welcome there because he was obedient, and he had help there because infinite power is back of the humblest child of God who is wholly obedient, wholly desirous of having God’s will done in all of his own affairs and in all of the affairs of His organization in the earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>Encouragement for the Remnant</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">There is great encouragement for the remnant of God’s faithful people on earth as they consider the experiences of Jehoshaphat. Like him they have covenanted to be obedient. Like him they are carrying on the work of going from door to door, and over the radio and otherwise are giving the people instruction in the Law of God, which the people must have if they are to survive Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like Jehoshaphat, the people of God sometimes get into tight corners. Some of the time it is their own fault, and some of the time it isn’t; but as Jehoshaphat was framed up by Ahab and went scot-free while Ahab himself was killed, so the Haman class, the clergy and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">their allies, now seek the destruction of God’s true witnesses in the earth, but the remnant know that they will be delivered and Haman will hang on his own gallows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like Jehoshaphat, it is possible to get into a campaign and to wage it for a time without a supply of water (truth), but the time comes when all the faithful need to come to Elisha and get what Elisha has for them, streams that are full to the brim, right in a land where drouth is everywhere. Jehoshaphat knew to depend on Elisha because he well knew that Elisha was a prophet of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And finally, the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth are confronted with a conspiracy something like that which sought to overwhelm Jehoshaphat and his people toward the close of his career, but which conspiracy utterly failed and the result was a complete vindication of God’s name in all that region. “The fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they heard that [Jehovah] fought against the enemies of Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shall we say that Jehoshaphat’s strength was in his obedience or in his prayers? It was in both. The prayers without the obedience would not have been received and would not have been answered. Obedience without the prayers would not have been sufficient. “Ye have not, because ye ask not.” The combination of the two is irresistible. ‘Ye shall ask what ye [the obedient ones] will, and it shall be done unto you.’ “If two of you [obedient ones] shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them.” But if not obedient, don’t bother to ask.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">OURTEEN years ago Patrick Conway, attendant in a Cleveland hospital, beat an aged man to death. the other day he gave himself up, but the police, though he admitted the murder, decided they could not prove it against him, and let him go free. About the same time that Conway committed this crime, Thomas Mooney, of San Francisco, was locked up for life for a crime which he has always insisted he did not commit, and which all the evidence shows he could not have committed. Conway goes free but Mooney stays in prison. It’s a great world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OR </span><span class="font5">more than a hundred years America has stood in the very foremost rank of the governments of the earth. . . . When the nation was young many of her statesmen were patriots, because they loved their fellow men and honestly and valiantly contended for a just government. Today there is no true patriotism among the rulers of the nation. It is now impossible for the people to elect men to public office and to expect them to enact just laws and to administer the affairs of the government for the general welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three visible elements of men that rule the nation are, to wit, the commercial, the political, and the religious, and of these three the commercial is the most powerful. Among the earlier statesmen of America there were some God-fearing men who foresaw the advance of a mighty and selfish power and gave warning that the greedy would some day destroy the liberties of the people. That warning was unheeded, and the selfish, commercial element, which is otherwise called “Big Business”, has stealthily and constantly moved forward to its goal. With grasping arms like the tentacles of a mighty octopus it has laid hold upon practically all of the visible wealth of the nation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font5">the same time the men who by laborious efforts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">developed the country and produced the wealth of the land have been unjustly treated and robbed, and today they are crying for bread, and that in a land of boundless plenty. Many Americans in sorrowful tones are now asking the question: Can the nation of America long endure while such unjust conditions exist?</span></p>
