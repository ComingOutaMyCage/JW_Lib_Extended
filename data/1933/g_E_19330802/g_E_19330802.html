<p><span class="font13">Stabilizing the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Broadcast from Hilversum, The Netherlands, by Judge Rutherford, Sunday, June 25, 1933</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HIS is not a political speech, but it pertains to the best government the world will ever know, hence a perfect government. The purpose of this speech is to enable the people to see what is the source of all blessings of peace, prosperity and happiness provided for those who do right. The people have been too prone to listen to and follow imperfect human guides. A sure and safe guide is needed. The Word of Jehovah God, as contained in the Holy Scriptures, furnishes that complete guide. The Scriptures were written for the aid and comfort of the people who are now on the earth and who are in great distress and perplexity. They disclose the only remedy for the establishment of the world in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A brief review of the history of man will enable you to more readily see and to appreciate the necessity of giving heed to the Word of Jehovah. There are in the universe two mighty powers unseen by human eyes; one is the true and almighty God of righteousness; the other is the false or mimic god of wickedness. The righteous One is named Jehovah; the wicked one is named Satan the Devil. The great question now before all creation and which must be for ever settled is, Who is supreme and by whom shall the people be guided and the world ruled ? The people must now have a knowledge of the truth to enable them to choose the wise and proper course to take. For that reason Jehovah God has made special provision in this time of distress for the people to hear and to learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When God created perfect man and put him on the earth He installed as man’s overlord Lucifer, a creature of light and pow’er. Because of his covetous desire to be equal to Jehovah God Lucifer rebelled against God and defied Him to put on earth men that would remain true and faithful to righteousness. Because of his wickedness the name of Lucifer was then changed by the Lord, and he is known as Satan the Devil. Ever since he has opposed God and deceived mankind. To give Satan full opportunity to prove his challenge Jehovah permitted him to go on in wickedness for a limited period of time; but that time limit has now come to an end. The great crisis has arrived. Man followed after Satan and was justly sentenced to death, and for that reason sickness and death have been upon the human race for many centuries. (Romans 5:12) That period of suffering and death, however, is also near an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You recall that the Scriptures declare that “&quot;the love of money is the root of all evil”. (1 Timothy G: 10) The reason for that is that Satan has commercialized everything in the world and planted in the heart of man greed for material gain at any cost. Satan began his wickedness by commercializing the human race to use them for a selfish purpose. Then he established a false religion for the very purpose of turning the people away from Jehovah God, and he has commercialized all religions to make religion a more effective part of his organization. The announced purpose of all organized religions is to gain something for creatures, and never to magnify the name of the Creator. Satan has gained control of “organized Christianity” and made commercial giants the principal men therein. He has commercialized politics and has caused everything to be used for selfish purposes. He has commercialized the food supply and all other necessities of life. There is plenty on earth for everyone, but selfish greed, the result of unrighteous merchandise, makes it impossible for millions to have the necessities of life. With these facts before us we can begin to understand the words of Jehovah God ad-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">dressed to Satan as set forth in Ezekiel 28: 1G, 18: “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore 1 will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of tire. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The elimination of Satan and his wicked organization is absolutely essential to the peace and well-being of the people. Only the Lord can accomplish that great work. His positive promise is that in His due time He will destroy that wicked organization. It is written, in 1 John 5:19, that the whole world lies under the control of the wicked one Satan, who blinds the people to the truth and turns them away from God. The only exception to this is those who give diligence to learn and to obey God’s Word of truth. The crucial hour has arrived, and now the question of supremacy must be settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How has Satan gained control of the world? Imperfect men organized governments and, they being selfish, the subtle and wily Satan easily influenced and got control of them. Satan has induced men to organize many false religions, and their teachers under his influence have blinded the people to the truth. This Satan has done lest the truth should shine into the minds of men and they learn of God and Christ and obey righteousness and live. (2 Corinthians 4:4) The most subtle and deceptive of all religions is that known as “organized Christianity”, for the reason that it operates under the name of Christ Jesus but denies Him and His kingdom as the only means of establishing the world in righteousness. When Christ Jesus was on earth He established the true worship of Jehovah, and His faithful apostles promulgated that truth. Soon after their death ambitious men got control of the organization, and under the blinding influence of Satan they have used that religion to turn the people away from God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Could not God have prevented the Devil from thus deceiving the people and gaining control of the world? To be sure, He could have done so; but by so doing there would have been no opportunity to prove Satan a boastful liar, no opportunity for other creatures to prove their faithfulness under severe tests, and for God’s name to he wholly vindicated. In harmony with this Jehovah caused to be written in the Bible of and concerning the Devil (Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Lee-see)</span><span class="font10"> : “[And in very deed] for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” This proves that in due time Jehovah’s name must be declared throughout the earth that the people might know the truth. That due time has now come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The wicked challenge by Satan, and his subsequent action, has brought great reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. The vindication of that righteous name is the all-important thing, because from Jehovah every good thing proceeds and He is the source of life and happiness. Jehovah has bided His own good time to give creation an opportunity to know His name and to take their stand on His side and thereby choose the way to life or to remain on Satan’s side and be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Long centuries ago Jehovah purposed to redeem the human race from death and then, in due time, to establish His righteous government on earth that all who would show their preference for righteousness might obey and live and enjoy the blessings of life. God’s promise was that He would raise up a seed through which all the families of the earth shall be blessed. That seed is the Christ -whose blood redeemed the world. Having purposed to do this God is certain to do it, because He so states. —Isaiah 46:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To accomplish His purpose Jehovah sent His beloved Son Jesus to earth, who laid down His perfect life in the place and stead of sinful man in order that mankind might be redeemed and live. (John 3:16) God raised up Jesus out of death as the divine One and clothed Him with all power in heaven and in earth and appointed Him to be the Vindicator of Jehovah’s holy name. When Jesus ascended into heaven He did not immediately begin the work of vindicating His Father’s name, because it was not then the due time. Jehovah said to Jesus, “Wait until my due time to put the enemy under thy feet.’ (Psalm 110:1) That due time began in 1914. How may we know that that marks ’the correct time? The Scriptures give the answer. When Jesus was on earth He laid great stress upon the importance of the kingdom of God. He taught His followers to pray for that Kingdom, lie promised that He would return and set up that Kingdom. When His disciples inquired of Him how it would be known when the wicked world would end, the time of waiting end, and when He would come, Jesus declared that the first evidence would be the world war, to be quickly followed by famine and pestilence. All men bear witness to the fact that these prophetic sayings of Jesus began to come to pass in 1914. Jesus said that the further evidence of this great time would be that the nations of earth would come into great distress and perplexity. That is exactly the condition that is in existence in all the nations today.—Luke 21: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Lord then pointed out that between the beginning of the events marking the end of the world and the beginning of the great battle of Armageddon Jehovah would give the people a clear understanding of His purpose and cause a wide witness to be given concerning the kingdom of God. Then He stated that after this witness work is finished there would come upon the world a time of trouble such as never before was known and that would be the end of all trouble.—Matthew 24:14, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the past ten years and in obedience to the commandment of the Lord men and women devoted to Him have been going throughout the land telling the people of and concerning the kingdom of God, and this they are doing in absolute obedience to the commandment of the Lord, and not for any selfish reason. Naturally, who would oppose the message of good cheer concerning the Kingdom and attempt to prevent the people from hearing it ? Satan the Devil, of course; and he does oppose it for the purpose of keeping the people in ignorance of what God has in reservation for them. Satan, seeing that he has failed to turn all men away from Jehovah, is now determined to cause the destruction of mankind rather than to see any more serve Jehovah God. Hence he causes his agents, and particularly his blinded religious representatives on earth, to keep the people in ignorance of the truth as contained in the Bible. These religious teachers, in “Christendom” particularly, indulge in form worship instead of teaching the people the plain truth. It is such agents or teachers that interfere with the people’s knowing the truth. This is exactly what the Lord foretold would come to pass in these last days, as it is written, in 2 Timothy three: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, . . . ; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For instance, Great Britain is the seventh world power and Satan is the invisible god or ruler of that world power. It is the most powerful empire that has ever been on earth. Its religion is called “Christianity”, but the most prominent men or leaders thereof do not believe the Bible, but call themselves “higher critics”. Today Great Britain will not permit radio stations to be used to broadcast the message of truth concerning God's kingdom. Canada has followed in the lead of her home country and likewise prevents the message of Jehovah’s kingdom from being broadcast. The arm of Jehovah is not shortened. He has provided other ways and means to permit the people of these countries to hear the truth. Faithful men and women are going throughout the land there, even as they do in this country, with the printed message to inform the people. Machines are being used for the proclamation of the message of truth. All this is done that the people might be informed and know what is the proper course to take for their own preservation. When that work of bearing testimony to the people is done, and it will soon be done, then will follow the battle of the great day of God Almighty, or Armageddon. In that battle Satan and his entire organization will be destroyed. Then immediately will follow the complete establishment of everlasting peace and righteousness on the earth. For that reason Jehovah God now gives commandment to His faithful witnesses to speak to the people these words (Psalm 96:10,13): ‘Say among the nations that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. For [the Lord] eometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.’ Here is the positive promise that Jehovah God will establish or stabilize the world in righteousness and that it will be forever ruled in righteousness by His King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everybody today sees that the commercial systems of the world are broken down. Alen are resorting to every possible known means among them to repair the broken-down machine and to start the world again in the way of prosperity. Regardless of their good intentions, and of their combined efforts, they are certain to fail, for the reason that Jehovah’s time has come to end Satan’s wicked, commercial, oppressive rule. Satan knows that the end is near and that he must fight, and he is doing what he can to prepare for it; hence the great preparation for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It will be conceded by all that religious leaders of the world now are telling the people that their suffering and distress has come upon them because of their unfaithfulness to their church organizations and hence God has sent this distress upon them as a punishment. Such claim or teaching is not only false, but a great defamation of Jehovah’s name. The twelfth chapter of Revelation shows that Christ Jesus began His reign in 1914, that immediately there followed in heaven a Avar between Christ and Satan and that Satan was cast down to the earth. Then the scripture reads (12:12): “Woe to the in-habiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” This is positive proof that the present distress upon the peoples of the world is due to Satan’s efforts to destroy them that they may not know and obey God and live. For this reason Jehovah will destroy Satan and his organization that the world may be established in righteousness and all the people have opportunity to learn the truth and live. In further proof of this, Jehovah now says to those who have faith in Him (Zephaniah 3:8,9); “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.” The kingdom of Got! under Christ is the only possible means of lifting up and blessing the peoples of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now the time has come when you must choose between God and the Devil. This you will do by taking your stand clearly and positively on one side or the other. For this reason Jehovah is sending His witnesses throughout the land to bring to your attention the truth, that you may be enabled to choose the right way. What advantage will there be to those who now make the choice to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom? The Lord answers that question, in Zephaniah 2: 2, 3, that all who do thus seek meekness and righteousness before the beginning of the great battle may be hid in that time of war and trouble. Those who are thus taken through the great trouble will be the first ones to receive the blessings of the government of righteousness. When that great battle of Armageddon is done “Christendom” will be completely done and destroyed. Then the world will be established in righteousness, that all men who love righteousness may seek after the Lord. All who do so and serve Him in spirit and in truth shall live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As Satan for centuries has been the invisible ruler of this wicked world, so Christ Jesus, the righteous One, becomes the ruler of the world, and His rule will be a righteous one and the people will he blessed. The Scriptures say (Proverbs 29: 2,14): “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Who will be the visible rulers of the nations of earth, seeing that Jesus will ever be invisible to human eyes </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font10"> The Scriptures answer that perfect men will rule in righteousness. There are now no perfect men on the earth; but Jehovah God can instantly put perfect men on earth, and will do so. In the eleventh chapter of Hebrews it is recorded that from Abel to John, the forerunner of Christ, there were a few men who maintained their integrity with God under the most severe test and received God’s approval. They all died living witnesses to the cause of righteousness and God provided a place for them in His kingdom under Christ. These faithful men died before the first coming of the Lord Jesus. The man Jesus was a descendant of these men, and hence they were called His fathers; but when resurrected as perfect men they will receive life through Christ and become His children, and in Psalm 45:16 it is so stated, and that they shall be the rulers in all the earth. Furthermore it is written (Isaiah 32:1): “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” This is Jehovah's means of establishing perfect rulers on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah's government under Christ shall bring everlasting peace, prosperity and life, because it is written, in Isaiah 9: 6, 7: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.” Then there shall never be another war, but everlasting peace shall abide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Men have set aside this and called it a holy year with the hope of bringing about peace and prosperity again to the world; but they are doomed to disappointment, and their efforts to complete failure, because God will first destroy the present wicked rule and then establish the world in righteousness. There is no other way of accomplishing this great thing. The prayers of all religious institutions cannot hold together this wicked world. It must perish that the righteous government under Christ may quickly follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In that kingdom or government of Christ the people who are obedient will be restored to health and strength. Sickness and suffering will pass away and all those who continue to obey the Lord will live for ever on the earth. Now the people suffer by reason of poverty, sickness and death, crime and oppression, but under God’s government all such evils will cease. It is written in God's Word (Isaiah 25: 6-9): “And in this mountain [kingdom] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will destroy in this mountain [kingdom] the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your dead loved ones are not in purgatory, or torment, consciously suffering anywhere, as you have been wrongfully taught. They are dead, unconscious, and in the graves. Jesus is authority for the statement that they are all in their graves and that they shall all be brought out of their graves and the obedient ones thereafter shall live and not die.—John 5: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The place for the everlasting home and blessings of the people will be here on the earth. It is stated in the Scriptures that God made the earth for man and man for the earth, that the earth abideth for ever. (Isaiah 45:12,18; Ecclesiastes 1:4) Upon this earth God through Christ will conduct the righteous government for the welfare of the people, and that government will continue for ever for the blessing of mankind. That will be complete proof that Jehovah is the Giver of all things good, that He is the Supreme One, that His Word is true, and that His ways are always right, and His name worthy of all praise. It will be a complete vindication of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why have those great truths not been known to the people long before this time? Because Satan has kept the people in ignorance of the truth by employing and using false religious teachers and it has not been God’s due time before to interfere and to bring the truth to the attention of the people. God’s due time has now come for the people to have an opportunity to know the truth, and for this reason He is sending 1 lis witnesses to you to inform you. It is of the greatest importance for you to learn the truth and then to take a course in harmony with the truth. You do not need to join some institution. You need only to know what is right and true and then do right by obeying God's righteous laws. Books are now published in almost all languages setting out at length these great truths and citing and quoting the Scriptural proof in every instance so that you may sit in your own home and take these books, together with your Bible, and learn what is the truth, that you may decide for yourselves what to do. It is to your best interest that you get these books to gain a knowledge of the truth and thus learn what God’s purpose is and how He will establish the world in righteousness and bring everlasting peace and blessings of life to all who obey. Remember Jesus said, ‘This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.’ My earnest request, therefore, to you is that you learn the truth of and concerning God and His kingdom. If you do this and take your stand on His side you will find the way to everlasting life, to peace, prosperity and endless joy. The source of all these blessings is the great God of the universe, whose name alone is JEHOVAH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Sacrosanct Clergy of Canada </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Axel Nielsen (Manitoba)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Two Parts —</span><span class="font10"> Part 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TT IS not my purpose to offend the religious J- susceptibilities of my neighbors. They are sensitive about their religious beliefs. Often they find fault with what they are supposed to believe, but resent criticism by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have knowm men who no longer practice their creed in public, and scarcely subscribe to the Word of God in any form, yet somehow, like a brook trout rising to a Green Bay fly, such men bristle with resentment whenever the creed into which they were born is criticized or belittled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The clergy have proved themselves false toward God and man; while men have failed to fortify themselves against the hypocrisy and treachery of religious leaders throughout organized “Christendom”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Immunity from Exposure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Canadian clergy, particularly the Anglican and Catholic priests, enjoy the confidence of corrupted governments and Big Business alike. Some people still smile in a supercilious manner when they see references to Big Business, believing that agitators have created a Big Business myth. But recent developments in the United States and elsewhere have shaken the public faith in these “captains of industry”, while events yet to come will prove conclusively that the crimes of Big Business are a fiendish reality. Everywhere can be noted a conscienceless cooperation among Big Business, government, and clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Particularly is this true in Canada, where the alliance has been knit into physical facts, as this article will prove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Premier Taschereau is virtual dictator of Quebec province, and his position is secured through the active support of the Catholic clergy and Big Business alike. The situation in Quebec closely resembles that obtaining in Spain before the Revolution, except that in Quebec a so-called “elective” government takes the place of a monarchy. But a straight election is not possible in Quebec, because the combined pressure of clergy and money power always forces the French Canadians to surrender their franchise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a significant fact that the Canadian clergy have enjoyed immunity from exposure, as the press closes its columns to justifiable, and even necessary criticisms. Thus the Canadian clergy, particularly the Anglican and Catholic priests, have been set on a pedestal, while propaganda maintains a myth concerning their probity. They are the sacrosanct of Canada, utterly inviolable, and above suspicion, no matter what they do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Sorrows of Church Orphanage Kiddies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">My knowledge of clergymen dates back to my childhood, when I w’as left to their merciless misdirection in a church orphanage. Of all barbaric institutions, a church orphanage is the most heartless and stupid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">People donated money to this particular orphanage most generously, and to such a liberal degree that notices had to be inserted in the papers declaring that no further donations w’ere needed. Yet the orphans were fed and clothed at a minimum of expense. We had all we could eat, but were fed separated milk from cows we boys ourselves milked, while the cream and butter were sold. On Sundays w’e had butter, but on week days we were fed lard. We did not starve, but the management was careful not to include little things that mean so much to children, although there was plenty of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Visitors were a trial, for then we paraded in our Sunday best, and had to emulate all the saints or pay the penalty afterward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sanctimonious, sour and vindictive Sunday school spinsters were much in evidence, and I remember once how close one of these came to getting a dinner plate broken over her officious nose:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Why, they even have sugar on the table! What an extravagance!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another one, seeing us drawn up in serge pants, black stockings, polished boots and white shirts, exclaimed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The idea! They're dressed just like other children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She was disappointed, no doubt expecting to see us in stripes or spots of some description.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Discredited Hell Mongers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The dictionary term for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">missionary</span><span class="font10"> follows: “A person sent to teach religion and do charitable work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Orphanage superintendents and matrons are missionaries too, for they are usually under the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">clergy, and the missionaries of “organized religion” are a frightful class. A clergyman’s creed in respect to children other than his very own can be summarized as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Spare the rod and spoil the child.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Teach 'em Hell and give ’em hell.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Fear is the best educator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Humility before clergymen is essential.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">5. An absolute mininum of worldly comforts for all charity cases must obtain in order to promote humility.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Money can be wasted without reserve, just so long as the recipients of charity do not benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have found that clergymen, who control the governing boards of church institutions like orphanages, hospitals, etc., are utterly incapable, devoid of practical common sense, and often ignorant in many respects. These clergymen pick the superintendents, matrons, and even janitors, applying the test of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">creed,</span><span class="font10"> together with outward demonstrations of church loyalty. Those in control of unfortunate orphans, of Indian missions and other church property, are never chosen for their honesty, humanity, tolerance and ability.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>How to Locate Hypocrites</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">A man can give plenty of lip service to his church, lead the Sunday school class, be a pillar in his church, and yet he can be, and often is, like a devil incarnate! I know, because as a child I was farmed out to these superficial ‘‘Christians” and saw them take the mask off on week days. Appointees of the clergy are almost always unsuited by temperament, training or inclination to receive the grave responsibilities to which they are called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The orphanage I attended is typical of all such institutions. An orphanage is a nightmare at any time, for the herding of little children into disciplinary camps fosters atrocities and grave injustices. Orphanages may be necessary, but I sincerely doubt it; for the children cry out in their miseries, while nobody listens. ‘‘You can’t believe a child,” and the superintendents in charge are such “proven Christians”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In any event, no clergyman has a right to enter a charitable institution, or to pick those responsible for the conduct of its affairs; for no clergyman can be what he is and at the same time be endowed with the tolerance, charity and sincerity which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">must go</span><span class="font10"> hand in hand with the grave responsibilities of caring for orphans and other unfortunate persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We had with us at the orphanage a superintendent whose name was H. K. Anderson. How we loved him! He was fair and just. Patience was his middle name. He had a sense of humor, and we trusted him. But sometimes he did not go to church. And he was even seen taking a glass of beer once! He was one of the few Christians that I have met in my time; but he was not fanatical about it, and that was too much for the clergy, who demanded his expulsion.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Typical Church Orphanage Superintendent</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Anderson’s successor was a religious fanatic of the most violent sort. He had a boy who was just about my own age, and I was delegated to show this boy around before the new superintendent had taken his hat off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Bet you’re scared of my father,” said the new’ boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I’m scared of nobody,” I replied. The son and heir made haste to report the matter, and I was dragged down to the river front, forced to cut a willow stick, and “justice” w<sup>T</sup>as administered. I refused to cry, or it wouldn’t have lasted so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fanatical superintendent always struck first and thought afterwards. Sometimes he prayed to God for His forgiveness, and took an hour or so to do this, while we had to listen respectfully, even if the dinner got cold or the milking hour had come. If we were clumsy at our work, he dropped to his knees and prayed God to give us sense. It is a nauseating chapter in my life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Below the Average of Human Decency</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I have never entertained illusions about clergymen. There is nothing sacrosanct about them. I always look for hypocrisy, and almost always it can be found in a clergyman. Weakness is another attribute, although this characteristic is not so general as hypocrisy. Most of them are selfish, while practically all of them are intolerant. Others are very ambitious, while some are dishonest. I can, of course, speak only about those whom I have met, and must admit that a few of the best were no better nor worse than the average carpenter. One or hvo ■were sincere and unselfish as individuals, but always spoiled the effect, and did much damage, by upholding false creeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A clergyman is almost always impractical, although he loves to meddle with things that do not concern him. He is therefore a mischief maker. To be sure, we should not expect perfection in a clergyman, for he is only human after all, “with the exception of the pope, of course.” But if clergymen as a class have a right to pull in their skirts while passing the common herd, they ought to give just cause for this attitude. Yet they are, as a class, far below the average of human decency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The clergy have stolen the respect which people originally intended for God, while there is nothing to support the popular belief that they are deserving of popular respect as a class, even though a few may be doing their duty as they see it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Subsidized Purveyors of Sorrow</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In addition to their criminal mismanagement of orphanages and like institutions and their championship of false political and social standards, the clergy have proved themselves particularly unworthy in the field of mission work, where the gentlemen are hidden away from more intelligent persons, and are therefore free to muddle along with their shortcomings quite unchallenged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I firmly believe that mission societies, and missionaries in particular, are a positive nuisance and do far more harm than good. This is certainly true of Indian missions, and is probably equally true of foreign missions in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An English schoolboy was asked to write an essay on “Empire Building”, and this is what he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“First a missionary is sent out to preach religion. He gets the natives down on their knees, and when the natives aren’t looking somebody runs up the Union Jack, and thus the Empire was built.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What a lot of truth there is in the above, after all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have traded among the Canadian Indians for more than twelve years, and in that time have come to know what a missionary is. As champions of truth and the Word of God, these men are a dismal failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A bad feature is the fact that a blind government subsidizes Anglican and Catholic priests in the Indian country, leaving the “education” of Indian children in the hands of incapable missionaries, while the health and morals of Indians are neglected by both the missions and the government.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>At Montreal Lake, Saskatchewan</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">It was at Montreal Lake, Saskatchewan, while managing a post for Revillon Freres, that I once more came face to face with clerical ineptitude, in the fall of 1918. Until that time I had studiously avoided organized religion as I would any plague, content to let the other fellow live in a fool’s paradise without me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Anglican missionary at Montreal Lake was a half-breed by the name of John Settee, who was incidentally the government school teacher, without any qualifications other than his Anglican appointment as preacher. Mr. Settee and the church were subsidized as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Indian Department paid Mr. Settee a teacher’s salary; furnished his living quarters and a schoolhouse, which was incidentally the church as well; furnished light, fuel and sufficient provisions to give each child of school age one square meal for each school day in the year, and paid Mrs. Settee a small salary for cooking the meals.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>A Twice-paid Total Fake</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Anglican church paid their missionary, Mr. Settee, $5 a month, while the collections received from the Indians far exceeded this sum, and the mission was therefore money to the good, had free use of government property, and managed to have the missionary appointed to a job for which he was entirely unfitted. The Anglicans raise money both in England and Canada to carry on this sort of business, and a gullible public pays the cost of a soft-salaried overhead gang!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For sixteen years Mr. Settee had “taught school” in Montreal Lake. I found grown men and women who were supposed to have “graduated” from his “school”. Yet not one of them could write his own name, nor speak a word of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I happened to take an interest in a half-breed boy whose father had been killed overseas. This youngster could not speak a word of English, and I insisted upon his going to school. That was how I discovered Mr. Settee’s school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Settee did not teach school a total of 24 days between November 15, 1918, and August 31,1919, by actual count.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Knew Only How to Collect</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">But he collected full rations for giving each child one meal a day, collected his own pay, while his wife collected pay for cooking meals which were never cooked. Furthermore, one could buy bacon and other articles from Mr. Settee, while it lasted, at half the going price, while the church wardens got their share for nothing, and the children went unfed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Settee, next to preaching, was very fond of freighting; he was always for hire, and did considerable work for the traders freighting to Lac la Rouge and Prince Albert. He tried to be back over Sunday whenever possible. As for the school, it was a complete farce and scarcely existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The boy referred to went to school as ordered, but always came back, because Mr. Settee had a headache, or a bellyache, or had gone for a load of hay, to Prince Albert, or some other place. 1 checked up on the boy, scarcely believing that Mr. Settee could draw his pay and do anything but teach school, and found out for myself that the boy was not lying. This sort of subsidized connivance between church and government is typical of Canada.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Honest Complaints Unheeded</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In February of 1919 the Indian Department sent up a nurse, as the influenza scare was then at its height. This nurse investigated health conditions, and found Mr. Settee’s house among the worst. She also discovered just how the school was run, waxed extremely indignant, admitted being an Anglican, yet promised that Mr. Settee would be out of there within two months. She was wrong; for Mr. Settee stayed for another four or five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then in June of the same year, 1919, Montreal Lake Indians were “honored” by a visit from the Anglican “bishop” Newman, who was in charge of the Prince Albert diocese. Newman arrived late Saturday, stayed over Sunday, and early Monday morning, just before leaving, came to me for a donation, which I gave him as only a 20-year-old disrespectful young enthusiast can give a white-haired old skinflint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I’ll have you know that Mr. Settee is a Christian gentleman,” replied the “bishop”, “and the school children are doing very well, considering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The old fraud never saw the school in session. “Considering” is the veiled excuse of all missionaries, who give a false impression concerning the mentality of Indian children, and would have you believe that the natives are uncommonly stupid. But the imprint can’t be better than the stamp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few weeks later I got a letter from the Indian Department, with which I had been corresponding :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“. . . in view, therefore, of Bishop Newman’s position and reputation, we must accept his report as to the condition of Mr. Settee’s school, and must refuse to entertain your complaints further.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That is typical of the conspiracy between governments and the sacrosanct clergy in Canada. Montreal Lake was only one instance in many, although I doubt if other missions were quite that bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Bishop” Newman retired three or four years later, and I read about his well-deserved trip to England, where he would spend his declining years in peace and rest. If he spent those years with a clear conscience he was happily insane.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>A Bishop Who Was Sincere</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I believe that “Bishop” Lloyd was Newman’s immediate successor. You get men like Lloyd, even in the Anglican church, men who try to reform from within, but usually they are a drop of white paint in a black pot, and count for very little once the mixture is stirred up. How “Bishop” Lloyd ever came to be a church dignitary would be an interesting story, for he is not the sort of man who gets places by flattery, wheedling, or the prostitution of his convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Be that as it may, Lloyd cleaned up the Montreal Lake mess in short order, and Mr. Settee found himself out of a job, temporarily at least,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lloyd did not alter the principle of government subsidies for missions. In fact, he is reputed to have secured even better terms. But he at least believed in keeping straight a rotten system, a difficult matter, especially in remote parts. He was sincere, which in some respects is half the battle, but he was in mighty bad company, and championed a most unworthy principle: that of subsidizing missions with government moneys.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>No Waters from Dry Wells</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">In September of 1919 I took charge of Prairie Lake Post, north of Grouard, Alberta. Between Prairie Lake and the Buffalo Head hills the Indians were mostly pagan, although there was an Anglican mission school at Whitefish Lake, which was only 40 miles east of Prairie Lake, while in Grouard were both Catholic and Anglican institutions, all heavily subsidized by the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The '“Rev.” White was in charge at Whitefish Lake school. He was a harmless curate, and got himself laughed out of Prairie Lake, and he never returned, for fear the Indians would scalp him. His school was a pitiful example of clerical incompetence in regard to all matters beyond the muttered rigmarole of his creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To say that he taught the children anything they did not know would be conceding him a measure of intelligence which he did not possess, for the man was entirely wrapped up in his creed, and hardly breathed the common air of every-day life. The North gets people, and missionaries fall the hardest, while the dangerous feature of this fact lies in the sacrosanct halo which surrounds the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was also a “Father” Petour, a Belgian Catholic priest, who traveled about the country trying to convert Anglicans and pagans alike. He managed to attach a few Anglican heathens, but the pagans barely tolerated him, while sometimes they jeered him openly, although the young Belgian was patient and sincere.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Oblate and Obtuse</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Catholic church is the mother of applied psychology and shrewd sociology. She doesn’t send a bumptious tyrant around the country when there is pleading to be done; and neither does she employ earnest, honest young men where a big bluff, a snarling driver, or a shrewd money grubber will do the best work, and pay bigger dividends. Intelligent priests are slated for advanced communities, and the hell-fire ignoramus circulates among the poor. The church displays a cunning which amply betrays the identity of her master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most of the Catholic missionaries among the Indians belong to the Oblate order. These priests are usually given a minimum education, and take the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience. They receive no salary, and are permitted no luxuries, nor do they question their superiors when orders are given. In actual practice, the Oblate “fathers” are well fed, warmly clothed and comfortably housed. They are not permitted to keep personal bank accounts, but their lot is far above that of those to whom they “minister”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the Oblate “fathers” are intensely ignorant. That is only natural, for it must take a weak head, or a poorly developed intelligence, to work for nothing while their masters get the best of everything, and good salaries besides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the Oblate “fathers” served God instead of the church, something could be said in their favor. But, while they do not seek money for themselves, they do extort money for the church, and from a people that can ill afford the outlay, and the pious camouflage is thereby entirely dispelled.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Hcdf-crazy Fanatics</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians have even less income today than formerly, and the missions have to depend in greater measure upon government subsidies of various sorts and descriptions. But some of the missions paid good money on their own account in years gone by; for traders have ways of knowing such things, and I have seen with my own eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Oblate “fathers” are sometimes fanatical, slaving for their church, and going half insane with the absurdity of their efforts. This has always been a matter of grave concern to those who would consider the welfare of Canada’s Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Traders and trappers sometimes go mildly insane, or become “bushed”, as the Northern term describes it, but rarely injure others thereby. A half-crazy, fanatical clergyman, claiming divine powers, subsidized and recognized by the government, can do and does great harm among the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians called Petour O-sow-o-ka-sees, with a slight accent on the “sow”, although the term means Red Fox. The priest had a red beard, and the pagan Indians said he was very cunning:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“He approaches ns with kindness, and a meek voice,” they said. “Bnt we have cousins in the Grouard missions. There the priests are fierce and merciless.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Subsidized to Teach Torture</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians spoke the truth. The clergymen made converts, and were immediately subsidized by the government for this 'good work’ among the Indians, for the pagans are an independent lot. The doctrine of hell-fire subjugated the Indians where strong-arm police failed. A baptized Indian then surrendered his children to the church schools, which are subsidized by the governments, and usually pay good dividends to the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Petour was sincere, as an individual. I talked with the Red Fox one night until daybreak, and we discussed many things besides religion. He sincerely believed that his church and God were one and the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In his little chapel hung an enormous paintingin bright colors. This painting depicted “hell’s fiery inferno”. A grinning red devil stood at the edge of a flame-belching red-mouthed pit. The devil had horns, red tusks, a spiked tail and cloven hoofs. He was sexless and naked. In his hands was a trident, with which he shoved hapless sinners into the depths of hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Leading to this pleasant destination was a broad highway, upon which danced merry sinners. Various indiscretions were depicted in the course of commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A narrow path led straight to heaven’s shimmering hosts, and upon this path walked a priest, leading the faithful to heaven. The artist cut a private passage for Martin Luther, for the reformer’s special benefit. Luther had no doubt started out right in the beginning, but the artist depicted Martin Luther with one foot on the hell passage, and the other foot lifting off the special short-cut which connected the straight and narrow with the sinful highway.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Teaching Pagans to Hate God</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">There were similar short-cuts to hell made and provided for other reformers as well, although Martin Luther was given greater prominence. The priests go into great detail when this picture is explained to the Indians. The picture itself seems to leave little to be said, but the priests put the artist to shame with their oral descriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This terrible picture hangs in every mission throughout the Indian North, and illustrates in vivid colors just what religion means to the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Catholic church issues a deluge of printed material, which is circulated among the Indians. This stuff is written in syllabic, and reads more like anarchy than any communistic material in print. White men are monsters and liars, according to this literature, unless they happen to be priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians have lost their backbone and sacrificed their manhood through the infiltration of bad habits, superstitious fears and shattered self-respect, or this sort of literature would certainly stir the Indians to violence. Most of this junk conies from the Jesuit college in Edmonton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Petour explained the hell-fire picture to me. The Indians were savages, he said, incapable of understanding love, divine justice, or unselfish acts of any sort. The Indians did understand fear, hate and punishment. The savages must therefore be scared into accepting the Christian religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then perhaps the second or third generation would absorb the better side of Christianity. Thus, the missionary spirit applied among the Indians was the same as that which was practiced upon me in the orphanage: Scare ’em. Give ’em hell!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Devil’s Poor Reward</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I once saw Petour humiliated in the Buffalo Head hills, and at the time my sympathies were entirely with the Red Fox. The priest tried to say mass for the pagans, who disregarded him utterly, beating their tom-toms louder and louder, while the young men jeered loudly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Petour took refuge in Banepowahow’s tepee, where he found the old Indian and his woman quite alone. Again the priest started saying mass, which was a foolish sort of persistence really, as no man has a right to force his religion on a foreign race. The young Indians crowded into the tepee with their tom-toms, and Petour at last gave up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the Red Fox asked the old Indian for a skin. The priest had come a long way, and had gone to great expense. I wondered what the old Indian would say to that, for the beaver and lynx skins which hung far above the smoldering teepee fire really belonged to me. Yet the Indians were queer in some ways, for I have known them to give things to a beggar, even though they despised and hated the beggar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Give the devil a skin,” said the old Indian to his woman, who reached up and brought down a worthless rabbit skin, which she handed to the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rabbit skins are now worth a few cents each, but in those days they were of no value, except as used by the Indians for mattresses and bedding. “Father” Petour was a martyr in his own eyes, but even as I pitied him as an individual, and expressed my indignation because a white man had been treated thus, a leather-faced old Indian told me to shut up, and I did shut up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“A hundred devil priests in many places have avenged what we have done to this man, and the score is far from paid. If only a few more of the devils would come this way: if only certain ones would come this way!” said the old Indian. I could name a few priests whose lives would not have been worth much in the Buffalo Head hills. “Father&quot;’ Petour was hounded out of camp, for the Indians followed with their tomtoms, and did not return until nightfall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There were apparent advantages in joining the church, for the Indian Department, besides subsidizing the missions in various ways, also entrusted government rations to the missionaries, and pagan Indians were therefore ignored. The church and the Indian Department worked as a unit, while the pagans had plenty of justification for hating both.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Pagans More Honest than '‘Christians&quot;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">As a trader I learned to trust an Indian according to the inverse ratio of Christian devotion which he professed. A “good Christian” was often the biggest crook, and the pagans were usually honest, provided a fair understanding had been reached between Indian and trader. The pagan eared little about ‘white man’s law’, and conducted himself according to moral codes alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Returned half-breed soldiers flooded the Buffalo Head hills,, bringing home-brew contraptions, playing cards and other tools of vice along with them. The pagan Indians were impotent against the lure of fire-water and cards. As a result, my books were cluttered with bad debts. Then the flu epidemic ravaged the country, and the post was closed out, for the Indians buried their dead and moved away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even so, with the company gone out of business in that section of the country, the pagan Indians journeyed to Fort Vermilion, where they sought out the Revillon manager and voluntarily paid their just debts. These accounts had been written off, and the Fort Vermilion manager had to write out to Edmonton for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the pagans paid a five-hundred-dollar debt, an obligation incurred when rats were selling at five dollars, and other furs in proportion. It took the Indians seven years to pay up, for the price of fur had dropped far below the inflation period following the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This Indian, and all the other pagan Indians, knew very well that they were under no legal obligation to pay. The returned soldiers had spread that knowledge from the beginning, just as they told the pagans that tribal marriages were not legal either.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the pagan Indians paid their just debts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Paying Just Debts by “Confessions&quot;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">As for the “Christian” Indian, confession is the commodity with which he pays his debt in most cases. It would perhaps be idle to assume too much, and say that the priests teach this doctrine literally, but the Indians believe in the forgiveness of debts, and the priests and missionaries do not discourage this belief, unless the church is the creditor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Father” Guilloux, of Pelican Narrows, even went so far as to write indignant letters to traders in which he explained that Indians were minors within the law, and therefore did not have to pay their accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That was perfectly true. But the Indians had contracted a moral obligation, and it hardly seems a clergyman’s place to argue the abandonment of a moral obligation, unless circumstances were such as to make him believe that the Indians were being swindled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Traders have been dishonest, but there were times when Guilloux took a fiendish delight in assisting the Indians, by giving moral support, to default their entire account. Where a trader outfits an Indian to the tune of five hundred dollars, and does not get one penny in return, there can be no doubt as to which is the dishonest party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Pelican Narrows Indians at one time developed the practice of paying all or nothing, until traders developed a parallel habit of giving the Indians nothing! The Indians believed in the confession and the forgiveness of sin, including nonpayment of just debts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Teaching Orphans to Hate Their Creator</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I was placed in a church orphanage at the age of eight years, and before that time had no definite knowledge of hell, as my mother did not subscribe to a physical hell, and guarded me from such false doctrines. But in the orphanage I found ‘hell’ on earth, except for a brief respite when II. K. Anderson was in control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The cruelty of teaching a burning hell to little children varies with the individual child, for not all children are equally susceptible to mental torture. I was an impressionable youngster, and suffered unspeakable torture, for Anderson’s successor was a religious fanatic of the most violent type, shouting hell fire and heavenly wrath before meals and after meals, at morning prayer and evening prayer, and any time in between, for the man brooded over such things at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It took quite a long time to convince me, for even as a child I reasoned that no man, let alone God himself, could torture a human creature in all eternity, whatever the sinner might have done to earn it. The punishment was bad enough even if a creature could be found who deserved it, but the executioner, in my opinion, would be even worse than the victim ever could have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A child is a child, and constant repetition, repeated whippings, and the fact that God permitted such a man to control the lives of orphans at last convinced me that God would actually torment sinners in all eternity.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Hell Is the Torchlight</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Hell is the torchlight of missionary work among the Indians. There would be few “Christian'’ Indians without the doctrine of a fiery hell, for the Indians could never reconcile the gospel of Christ with the injustices they have been made to suffer at the hands of white men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the Indians understand fear, and therefore “understood’’ the doctrine of hell, and accept Christianity for that reason. It is remarkable how well the missionaries have understood Indian psychology in this regard, while these same missionaries have failed to understand the Indian in every other respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The confession and forgiveness of sins are the Indian’s only solace. The Catholic church is by far the most successful among the Indians because the confession box is a physical “evidence” of actual forgiveness. Protestant Indians are taught to confess privately, and such Indians believe in complete forgiveness merely for the asking, even though an occasional missionary does explain the principle of sincerity that must go with a silent confession. Still, the Indians put their own literal interpretation to many statements, and believe what they believe, missionaries to the contrary notwithstanding.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Proper Self-Respect Destroyed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians, particularly the Catholics, regard the form rather than the spirit of confession. They are terribly concerned when someone is thought to be dying, and will travel hundreds of miles for a priest, who will travel those hundreds of miles back with the Indians, to give the Devil his due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many such Indians have been given the last sacrament half a dozen times, over and over again, through several months or even years of sickness, while more than one Indian has died of fright as he viewed with terror-stricken eyes the paraphernalia of the sacraments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All Catholic priests teach the Indians that non-Catholies go to hell, and many of the Protestant missionaries return the compliment with gusto. Villages divide according to creed, and families split up with undying hatred when creeds intermarry. Incidentally, the Catholics always gain, numerically at least, by such marriages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Crees are, for the most part, a degenerate race, for their blood is badly mixed with white scum, venereal diseases and tuberculosis, while two centuries of harsh subjugation at the hands of “gentlemen” adventurers and their successors have destroyed the self-respect of all but a few scattered bands, and a few scattered individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The priest in Pelican Narrows, like the priests in every Northern mission, conducted daily catechism classes for the children, and his pupils ranged in age from three upward. The church bell was forever ringing, like a Spanish monastery, what with morning mass, catechisms, noon hour, evening hour, evening prayer, vesper bell, confession bell, and I don’t know what else. Sunday or week day, there didn’t seem to be much difference.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Poor Little Indian Kiddie</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I remember one little Indian boy, a youngster of six years, who expressed great concern for the safety of my soul because I did not attend his church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“You will go to hell,” he announced, and then he proceeded to describe hell in vivid Cree phrases:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It is a big fire, a forest fire; and it never goes out. It is like a red-hot stove, only so much bigger, and they put you right inside the red-hot stove, and you can’t get out! You get awfully thirsty too, and when your mother sees you there she just laughs! ‘Why didn’t you obey the priest ?’ she asks you, and then she laughs some more. Your owm mother laughs at you ! Then if you ask her for some water, she laughs again, laughs, laughs. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the boy burst out crying, and I comforted him; for I could remember when I was put through the same torture. Indian children are not all sensitive to mental suggestion, but this little chap was one of those who were. Many of the Indian children took a philosophical view of such matters, deciding to obey the priest, and depend upon the church for redemption. That is just what the clergymen scream over the radio every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Incidentally, the Cree name for hell is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Mitch-eskicateic',</span><span class="font10"> or 'evil lire’. The Cree word for the chief fireman is </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">M it chi-man'i-tou,</span><span class="font10"> or ‘evil god’. You should hear the Indians describe hell and the Devil in their own language, and see their eyes bulge!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Church Discipline</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The priests are petty tyrants, once they have convinced the Indians that hell is a most uncomfortable destination. In Pelican Narrows, for instance, it was against the dictates of “Father” Guilloux for a Catholic Indian, especially a woman, to attend a harmless square dance, on pain of excommunication. Everyone knows that a priest does not possess such powers, but the fakes are sufficient unto themselves up north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The priests always singled out the women for excommunication. The procedure in Pelican Narrows was very cruel, for the Indian women always attended church to the last soul, and the “guilty” ones were therefore sure to be there. Instead of notifying these women beforehand that their presence in church was not desired, the priest chose to denounce them in open congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The names of the women were called out one by one, and summary sentence imposed of thirty days to three months, during which time the “guilty” women could not enter the church, nor receive “benefit of clergy” in any way. Then the church wardens escorted the weeping women bodily to the door, while neither husbands nor fathers, sweethearts nor brothers, made any objections whatsoever.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Innocent Pastimes Tabooed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Protestant Indians were not restrained from dancing the square dance, and if fault could be found with the Pelican Narrows Indian dances it lay in the well-founded and sometimes belligerent complaints of Protestant bucks, who objected to Catholic Indian bucks’ joining the dance without bringing female escorts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In other words, the Protestants supplied the women, the dance and the music, while the Catholics sneaked in without their women folk, although once in a while three or four of their females took the Devil by the horns and braved public disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">subsidized a Catholic woman to break up the practice of excommunications, and in due time this woman was also excommunicated. She had a come-back, as the bargain called for that much, and this woman told the priest in public that he could keep his fool church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She kept her word, and the priest begged her to return, which at last she did with the understanding that she danced or she did not dance, according to her own inclination. She was forty, and quite capable of looking after herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But this did not stop the priest from excommunicating the weaker women, as I had hoped it would. The Indians appealed to “Bishop” Charlebois, who, although he would not denounce Guilloux, openly declared that the priest had no right to chase their women folk out of church. But I broke up the practice little by little, as the priest permitted the Indians to dance in the daytime to start the thing going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then I refused to donate toward weddings and other celebrations unless the Indians held their dances in defiance of the priest, which at last they did, and the excommunications became a thing of the past.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Minding Other People’s Business</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The fear of hell-lire is the Indian religion, although certain forms and rituals also appeal to him. The fear of hell is deep-rooted, and explains entirely the power which missionaries, especially Catholic priests, exercise over the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Church attendance is nearly 100-pereent effective with such Indians as happen to be in town. The priests are particularly watchful in this respect, and will publicly denounce their delinquent flock as a whole, and then single out the offender by name. In this way relatives and friends assume responsibility for the attendance of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Discipline, particularly among the Catholics, takes absurd form at times, such as prohibiting sleeveless garments, taboos on bobbed hair, even denunciation of a V-neck blouse, and positive orders stipulating that a woman’s skirt must drag in the dirt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Man and woman must never converse together in public, nor be seen together except in groups, and more of the like. It would be a waste of time to give all the facts, for a modern world would refuse to believe.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>The Terrors of Superstition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">John Cusiter, a seventeen-year-old Indian boy, was dying of consumption. He was a Birch</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Portage Indian, and the time was in March of 1929. His father, together with two uncles and another male relative, journeyed to Flin Flon to fetch a preacher, for the Pelican Narrows district did not boast a resident Anglican preacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians arrived in Flin Flon with a pony toboggan, and sent the “Kev.” Fraser of The Pas an urgent wire, which was answered in person. Meanwhile, a preliminary March thaw had set in, and the streets of Flin Flon were running water from melting snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians knew that the thaw would last but a day or two, and everything would freeze up tight again. But they could not convince the clergyman, who was afraid to make the journey, although the Indians pleaded with him and promised Mr. Fraser that he would not even get his feet wet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There has never been a time when I could not travel, break-up or not, although I would not expect others to follow me. But it was absurd to expect break-up in March. Today is the 21st of April, and we still have two feet of snow in Cranberry, in spite of the usual March thaw v hich took part of the snow off, as it did in 1929, and always does. Just out of Flin Flon, which is thirty miles north of here, the snow is probably three feet deep today. The lakes are still solid today, and will be solid for another two weeks at the very least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sadly disappointed, the Indians returned without their clergyman. I saw the Indians at Birch Portage, and tried to comfort the sick boy, who raved about the fiery hell which “Rev.” Fraser himself had taught the Indian youth. Mr. Fraser spoke Cree fluently, unlike most Anglican missionaries, having learned the language during his childhood, and John Cusiter was doubtless given a vivid impression of what “hell” was like. I could not comfort the sick Indian; for when I tried to disabuse him of mistaken beliefs in hell-fire and torment, the youth took me to be the Devil himself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Dying Boy Made a Raving Maniac</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">I went on my way to Flin Flon, returned to Birch Portage a few days later, and then traveled back to Pelican Narrows. After that I journeyed the three hundred miles from Pelican Narrows to Lac du Brochet, and back-tracked the same distance to Pelican Narrows again, where I rested my dogs for a day, and then started for Flin Flon with a three-hundred-pound load of furs on my sleigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was no snow on the portages, as it was the end of April, but the ice was good except in the rivers. Six weeks had passed since the “Rev.” Fraser had insisted that the 35-mile journey to Birch Portage was too dangerous. Yet I had traveled some 900 miles by dog team since that time, and was still traveling, without four husky Indians to guarantee that I wouldn’t get wet, or pull me out of the drink should the sleigh go through at that late date, while I had a precious cargo of furs which had to be kept dry and be portaged on my back across the sandy jackpine stretches where the sleigh buried itself in the ground and the dogs could not budge the load.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On my way to Flin Flon I passed through Birch Portage again and found that the boy had become a raving maniac. I suggested that the Indians send for “Father” Guilloux, in spite of creed, but the Indians were indignant. To them it was like sending for the Devil himself. Meanwhile the young Indian suffered untold mental torture, and I hit the trail once more, arrived in Flin Flon safelv, and took mv fur on to The Pas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I got back to Pelican Narrows about the middle of May, crawling over ice floes to do so, and a day latei’ the Birch Portage Indians arrived with John Cusiter’s body. They too crawled over ice floes and risked their lives, all for the sake of burying John Cusiter in consecrated ground. But the clergy who teach such things, hell and consecration, are afraid of a March thaw.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Why Traders Support Missions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The missions prosper with the connivance of governments, while the traders also lend moral support to the missions, in addition to financial assistance, for the missions are a stabilizing economic influence among the nomad Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many traders once found themselves abandoned as the Indians followed the caribou trail, or migrated to better trapping grounds, or vacated the country following an epidemic during which they lost relatives and friends to the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Traders support the missions for selfish reasons, which makes it harder still for the Indian to get a square deal. The Indians are extremely superstitious, and then<sup>-</sup> churches have become an anchorage to which they cling no mattei' how barren the country may prove of everything but tickets to heaven, according to their belief in priestly powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Both fur and game migrate, and in former days the Indians followed the fur and game supply. But today the Indians stay with the church, starving their families rather than leaving the one thing which 'stands between them and a fiery hell’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Pelican Narrows and elsewhere the Anglican missionaries make but a few calls annually, outside of the summer months when sometimes a student stays over if the government can be persuaded to subsidize a missionaryschool-teacher, the Indian Department paying the salary while the church takes the credit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Unreliable Prophets of Evil</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Anglicans usually tried to visit Pelican Narrows twice during the winter: just after Christmas, and just before Easter. The date of their coming was usually advertised in advance. But there was no telling as to whether they would come or not, nor would they always arrive on the advertised date; for none of the ihis-sionaries wanted the trip, although the roads were very good between The Pas and Pelican Narrows. Dogs were sometimes used, or a driving team, but in any event the trails were open, as northern travel became more concentrated the farther south one traveled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians came in for more than a hundred miles around, men, women and children, abandoning trap lines and fish nets, all for the sake of a single church service. Sometimes the Indians found either Mr. Fraser, of The Pas, or Mr. Fisher, of Cumberland House, on hand to mumble a few things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “Rev.” Fisher spoke no Cree whatever, but read a rigmarole from a phonetically spelled Cree hokus-pocus compilation, and doubtless didn’t know what he was saying, nor did the Indians. But he was a clergyman, and “possessed the key to heaven”, and could shield the Indians from the “fiery furnace”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Both Indians and Traders Ruined</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The missionaries never stayed longer than a day or two. The Indians and traders paid the expenses in any event, with sometimes a bit to spare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At best the Indians found a clergyman on deck as described above. But sometimes the Indians arrived to find that the clergyman had come and gone, a week ahead of schedule. Other times again the clergyman was late, and nobody knew when he would arrive, or if he would arrive at all. Then it was that traders wished that something would shrivel the missions completely, for their Indian customers demanded dog feed while they waited, together with provisions for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The traders usually met these demands, for the intricacies of Northern trading are many, and it would take chapters of illogical apologies to explain them. The delays cost the traders plenty, and the pilgrimage cost the Indians a great deal in terms of spoiled furs and lost time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It took the Indians from two to seven days to get in, for a caravan travels slowly, unlike the brisk trader who chases down the elusive mink skin in competition with others. Besides, the Indian had to lay up dog feed and what not, while preparations as a whole took a week on the average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the irresponsible missionaries were a week late about a third of the time, and sometimes did not show up at all, while the Indians waited just as long as the traders would stand for it, the Indians lost a month, on the average, twice in a winter, or almost a third of the trapping season ; all for the sake of being absolved from the rigors of hell by a clergyman who read out of a phonetic rigmarole which didn’t make sense either to himself or to the Indians 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The missionaries only proved how impractical clergymen are as a class, for no sane person would deliberately keep a hundred Indians waiting while they argued the question of what to do, especially after advertising what they </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font10"> do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Greedy Dogs That Never Have Enough</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Nor did the missionaries ever make a mistake as to the most comfortable place in town, which in Pelican Narrows happened to be our place. I got so fed up at last that I told one or two of them quite plainly that some one of the other traders might share the responsibility of feeding missionaries and their entourage, besides having native church wardens barging in for conferences and similar demonstrations. The church wardens were always the biggest crooks, and I would much rather have thrown them out, instead of sticking them for the sake of a missionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A missionary’s chief concern is always his salary, speaking of Protestants. I never saw one who wouldn’t talk at great length on the subject, making invidious comparisons, while none of them should be paid, in my opinion. Take money out of Christianity and there would be some hope for the Indian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Catholic Indians had a full-time padre in Pelican Narrows, with sometimes one or two spares as well. Christmas and Easter were big church days, although “holy” days rained down as in a Spanish calendar in pre-Revolutionary times. The Indians often used these minor “holy” days as an excuse to neglect their traps and drive to town. But the Christmas and Easter pilgrimages were positively compulsory, while great distances or sickness were not allowed to interfere with strict observance under a consecrated roof.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Widespread and Terrible Cruelty</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians made the trip with half-starved dogs and miserable camp equipment. I have camped with them on the trails in winter, out in the open, sitting before blazing fires which burned on three sides if the winds permitted, while great columns of white mist raced upward as the heat struck the “fifty below” of a Northern night. Little children whimpered all night long with the intense cold, while sometimes the men kept the fires going if the wind sprang up and made the cold unbearable. Then the sparks would fly over the scant bedding, and the whole night through was a vigil to keep alive against the rigors of winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And I have tracked the Indians, too; for the trails were an open book, and were littered with starved pups and frozen train dogs, and dogs that died in harness under a shower of blows. The trails were strewn with the sticks and bludgeons with which the Indians beat their dogs, as the Indians must get there on time ‘for the sake of their black souls’!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Easter trip is not so cold, but in some respects more cruel; for Easter sometimes falls in April, when the snow is going and water runs everywhere. I have seen women and children wade into water and slush above their knees, without any footgeai' other than moose-skin moccasins. The water stays on top of the ice until it seeps through, about the first of May, while the women and children trudge through miles and miles of it, a hundred miles into town and a hundred back to camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Epidemics often result from exposure of this sort, and expectant mothers sometimes go temporarily insane, while the sick Indians leave unpaid bills.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Priest Issued the Rations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">One of the mission grafts was the handling of government rations. Woe be unto the disobedient Indian! for he did not partake of bacon and beans very often. At Pelican Narrows the distribution of rations was a particularly vicious process, as “Father” Guilloux was a petty demagogue in a backyard principality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This priest went so far as to snatch converts from the absent Anglicans with government rations, which sometimes amused me, and sometimes got my goat, for Catholic Indians learn to crawl on their bellies in the wrong places, and are more fanatical than the Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My employer, Arthur Jan, was justice of the peace at the time. As a trader he did not like to interfere, but sometimes the priest went too far, and then Mr. Jan demanded investigations by the ‘mounties’ (mounted police).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I uncovered a rotten mess at South End myself. There the priest had delegated the issuing of rations to a councilor, who was also a church pillar, while said councilor and his friends consumed the government rations, leaving the widows and sick Indians with nothing. The mounty was himself a Catholic, and was loath to investigate. In duty bound, he caught the councilor red-handed, for the councilor’s wife openly admitted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Of course we keep the bacon and (lour for ourselves. What for is my husband a councilor? And first man in the church besides!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Government cases and bags were in the house, and nothing could be plainer theft, with bold admission besides. I don’t know how the matter was reported, but I do know that nothing was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What caused me to report the matter in the first place was the poverty of two women, one of them a gray-haired old great-grandmother of 70, the other one a widow with four children. These two women begged so often that I got tired of it, knowing, as I did, that sufficient rations were left by the Indian Agent to take care of their needs. I made inquiries at the time, and relatives of the councilor openly admitted that the destitute women got nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Sometimes we give them meat,” these men declared.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>“First Man in the Church”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Indians have much less respect for the mounties since that time, for the councilor got up in plain view of the Indian agent and declared :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“There was a redcoat who poked his nose into things that were not his affairs. You all know that he has gone from the country. I made him run. Your councilor does not tolerate interference. The next redcoat will behave himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a matter of fact, the mounty in question was moved because his three-year term was over, but the Indian agent was there, did not object to what the councilor said (perhaps he did not understand Cree) and did not publicly condemn the councilor because the Indian quoted the priest as his authority to convert government rations to personal use. This same councilor was the man who adopted a ten-year-old Indian girl and took her along on the trap line. The girl gave birth to a child at the age of 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mounties were often dissatisfied with the way Indian rations were handled, but they had to go easy, and be able to prove their complaints to the hilt and beyond where missionaries were concerned, for the sacrosanct clergy of Canada are entirely above suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The mounties, with Mr. Jan’s official support, and moral support from myself and others, corrected the more flagrant cases of blunt injustices, and sometimes got bawled out for their fairness, while neither heaven nor earth could move a moribund Indian Department to correct abuses at the source, and take relief matters away from a crazy clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But “Father” Guilloux at last went completely berserk, and the mounties were then empowered to issue orders on local stores if the priest refused to deliver the rations which were in his keeping. But the priest was not forced to give up the handling of regular rations, in spite of proven incompetence and unfairness. The clergy of Canada are the sacrosanct tools of the government.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Government Rations as a Weapon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">“Father” Guilloux was determined, to quote only one case, that a certain Edward Sewap should get no rations. The old Indian was over sixty, a Protestant, and suffered recurring attacks of paralysis. His wife was in the hospital, two hundred miles away, in a critical condition with frightful burns. The woman left four small children with the old man, besides an idiot son who could not be depended upon to look after the sick Indian father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But someone had overheard somebody say that another somebody had seen Edward Sewap carry an armful of wood into his teepee. The whole village knew that Edward Sewap took fits daily, and never knew when the paralytic strokes would overcome him. He therefore could not fish, limit or trap, and was plainly a destitute case. But “Father” Guilloux saw in the old man’s plight an opportunity to make a belated convert to the Catholic faith by using government rations as a weapon, for the old man had many relatives, and his conversion would lead to more conversions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The priest reckoned without the mounties, who found in Edward Sewap a clear-cut case, and the old Indian received rations from other sources in spite of the priest. Scarcely a month later the old Indian was taken with paralysis as he sat before the tepee fire. The helpless man slumped into the fire, and the children found their father lying with his head buried in the burning coals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I was notified, and wired for a ’plane, as the mounty was out of town. Edward Sewap was taken to The Pas, where he died in a few hours. It was a remarkable coincidence that man and wife should lie close together in a hospital ward, both of them suffering from burns.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Catholic Institutions of Atrocity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The old Indian did not recover consciousness, and thus he died a Protestant; for the hospital was a Catholic institution, and the contemptible priests would have worked over the old Indian and secured his “conversion” in order to gain possession of his children, had the Indian been conscious. Church institutions do not manage hospitals for love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The woman recovered, and although she stayed in the hospital for more than a year, and was repeatedly told that the Catholic church was caring for her, the woman would not change her religion. The hospital authorities were well paid for their trouble, through the Indian Department, hut lies are the essence of “Christianity” today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some ambitious friend of “Father” Guilloux took the Sewap children to a Catholic boarding school, and the woman had to fight for her offspring. She would have got nowhere by her own efforts, but the Anglicans were interested, and the children were released through the efforts of “Rev.” Fraser.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">He barks out the number of coins in a purse, when even the owner himself does not know; or the number of cards in a stack, the number of diamonds in a ring, the number of cigarettes in a case, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The curious look in the eye of this highly intelligent dog plainly reveals that the power there manifest is not natural wisdom; it is the “wisdom” of the unclean ones that besought the privilege of entering into the swine; the “wisdom” of the clairvoyant, astrologer and spirit medium.</span></p>

If these statements are correct it helps one to become reconciled to the overrunning of the country by the Japanese, as it seems they<sup>7</sup> are unquestionably determined to do. In the year 1932, in the one city of Shanghai alone, 33,616 bodies of infants were found in the streets, alley's and on the river and creek banks, most of them victims of infanticides. Also 3,088 adults were found.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The whole financial system of the world today, in all its immense complexity, stands completely upon the claim that money at its point of origin establishes for its manufacturers a valid title to real wealth. Put your finger if you can upon any item of real wealth the Money Power parted with to lend us. You cannot: no such atom of anything real was ever there at all. All that the war loan represented as we received it in the first instance from the Money Power was a book entry of credit carried into account as an advance of credit. At the root of the whole trouble is the accountancy trick by which the Money Power claims that the issue of new money is an advance of credit against the value of the goods which will ultimately (low from the activities in which the community is at the moment engaged. All our finance procedure is based on that perversion in accountancy. For it is only by perversion in accountancy that the trick is achieved. Maintaining the national credit simply means giving the Money Power a feeling of such confidence in our keeping on doing this as will induce the money-manipulators to keep on lending us the use of our own activities at the same price.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">General conditions in Canada would be much easier if the spread between what the farmer receives for his products and tire prices charged for the goods manufactured from those products were considerably narrowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This phase of the present situation in Canada ought to be thoroughly and speedily investigated as suggested in the House of Commons recently by Robert McKenzie, M. P. for Assiniboia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. McKenzie pointed out that wool was selling at from four to four and a half cents a pound, but for the same wool manufactured into underwear the people had to pay between $2 and $4 per pound. Another farmer bought a tin cup, tin float and three small rubber rings for his separator, lie sent $1 with his order, not knowing the price, and when the parcel arrived he had to pay C.O.D. an additional charge of $2.91. In other words, the eight ounces of tin he received cost him 800 pounds of wheat, or 1,600 pounds of barley, or 1,700 pounds of oats, or 40 dozen eggs, or 3316 pounds of butter. A man would have to sell 30 cowhides at present prices to pay for a pair of cowhide boots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. H. Butcher, M.P. for Last Mountain, who seconded Mr. McKenzie’s resolution, said one farmer received $30.86 for 3,710 pounds of beef and he was offered $2.50 for a pig which, when slaughtered, yielded 80 pounds of lard and 325 pounds of pork.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Parliament once again has clothed the prime minister with the power of a dictator such as he exercised during the World War. The excuse for asking for such power was that it was necessary in order to assure stability within Canada in the maintenance of national affairs. When the matter was up for discussion Premier Bennett and lit. lion. W. L. Mackenzie King crossed swords over the “peace, order and good government” clause, which the Liberal leader said was planned to meet a crisis “so imaginary it cannot be named in this parliament”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I think my right honorable friend is making a mistake,” Mr. King warned sharply, criticizing modern tendencies to dictatorship. “Let the pendulum swing in one direction and it will go just as far in the other. If parliament places absolute power in the hands of one man, then I can see the C.C.F. group at the next election telling the people that they had better choose a dictator representing themselves, rather than a dictator representing a class to which they are opposed.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>Not on a Gold Basis</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The following very misleading item concerning the soundness of Canadian banks appeared in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Mail and Empire</span><span class="font10"> recently:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Witbin five days nearly 1,000 queries have, arrived in Ottawa asking for information as to why thousands of United States banks fail each year while no Canadian bank has dosed its doors in more than twelve years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The situation is predicated, of course, upon the fact that today thirty states of the United States had restricted their banking facilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The answer is three-fold, but first and foremost it is that security of the depositor is paramount. Secondarily, it is that the double liability of shareholders makes them doubly cautious; and thirdly, that the types of securities in which Canadian banks may invest outlaw many of the frozen factors in the United States situation, including mortgages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Premier Bennett put the matter to the. House, of Commons two years ago when he said that the money that banks had to loan was that of depositors. And because Canadian banks have not made speculative loans, no Canadian bank is in distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is the answer to the 1,000 inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The truth of the matter is that the Canadian banks are not on a gold basis. If they were called upon to pay their notes in gold, as banks in the United States are, they too would require to close their doors.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>An Impossible Offer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The generosity of mortgage companies in Canada is well pictured in the following from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Saskatoon Star-Phoenix:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Proposals made by lending institutions for the adjustment of mortgage debts in Saskatchewan are such that no farmer can live up to them, if the calculations made by an agricultural scientist here are correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mortgage companies offered to grant an extension provided the mortgagor would enter into an agreement to deliver one-third of all the crops grown on the mortgaged lands to the companies, to be applied on the mortgage accounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The example is taken of a typical wheat-growing farm witli ISO acres of wheat and 60 acres of oats. A 16-bushel crop of wheat would amount to 2,880 bushels ; and a 20-bushel crop of oats, to 1,200 bushels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The proceeds of one-third of the wheat at 25 cents a bushel would amount to $240; and one-third of the oats, at 8 cents, to $32. This would make $272 to be deducted from the amount received for the grain the farmer would sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Me could not sell more than 2,700 bushels of wheat, as he would require to retain one bushel per acre for seed. The balance of his oats would be required for feed. His gross sales would therefore be 2,700 bushels at 25 cents, or $675.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From this would be deducted the $272 for the mortgage company, $213 for threshing the wheat and a portion of the oats, and, say $175, for taxes. This would leave the farmer the sum of $15 for machinery and equipment maintenance and the year’s wages for operating the farm with 240 acres of crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The authority quoted considered that it would be a mistake for any farmer to enter into such an agreement, which he could not possibly fulfil.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>Worshiping the God Usury</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Under the captions “The Bankers See a Crisis Coming” and “ ‘Slash, Slash, Slash’—for the Farmers” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Fudoiv</span><span class="font10"> gives us the following very interesting editorials:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Canada is heading for a financial crisis. The bankers, financiers and financial papers are sounding the alarm. A crisis is around the corner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the past three years thousands of unemployed have been near starvation, thousands of farmers, their wives and children, have been going without, patching their old clothes, letting the tin lizzie stand in the garage to save the license fee and gas, getting by on old machinery that is fit only for the scrap heap, working longer hours to save the wages of a hired man, burning flax straw and willows to save coal. But in the eyes of the bankers these things do not make a crisis. These are “necessary adjustments,’’ “natural remedies,’’ “evidence of the thrift and fortitude of the people of Canada.’’ That is the way the poverty of the toiling masses has been described at shareholders’ meetings. That is the way the Speech from the Throne has covered up the shoeless children, the lack of underwear and the semi-starvation of thousands. But now the pocketbook's of the bankers are in danger. That is a crisis! The bankers do not have to go without their interest collections as the farmers have gone without suits: their pocketbooks are menaced— that is a crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In periods of “prosperity’’ Canadian industiy depended on outside capital to keep the wheels of industry turning, to pay the interest on foreign borrowings, to pay the insurance premiums and ocean freights to the British shipping magnates who owned the ships that carried Canadian goods over the ocean. Even as late as 1930, no less than two hundred and thirty-eight million dollars of British and foreign capital came into Canada that year. This capital came into Canada, not for the benefit of the workers and farmers, but seeking the higher interest rates that are paid in young and developing countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now the situation has changed. No more foreign capital is coming into Canada. In 1931 $30,000,000 of foreign capital was withdrawn from Canada; in 1932 $50,000,000 was taken from the country. Foreign investments in Canada now total six billions of dollars. To the bankers, financiers and plutocrats this is a serious situation. The national income has been reduced. Production has fallen until one-half of the workers of Canada are unemployed. The prices of the basic commodities of Canada, wheat, pulp and paper, copper, asbestos, have shrunk almost to a vanishing point. But out of this reduced production at reduced values, the interest on foreign investments, insurance premiums and shipping charges must be paid. This was never done before. Never, even in the best years, were the surplus values sufficient to meet these charges. Now they must be met from a reduced national income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The financiers look around for a place where savings can be made. They see the government deficits and the mounting debts of federal, provincial and municipal governments. This debt is mountain high. The combined federal, provincial and municipal debts total $6,111,010,146. Taxes now swallow up one-quarter of the annual value of production in Canada. Something must be done, say the financiers, to keep these debts from piling up higher; something must be done to lower the burden of taxes. If they could just cut those taxes, they might be able to stagger through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The bankers and financiers look over the budgets of past years. They see the toll of interest. They see more than half of the total taxation going to pay interest, but they do not suggest a cut there. Of course not! That would be one way, but they would be cutting their own incomes, and bankers always look out for themselves! And the banks hold $860,000,000 of government securities, provincial and municipal loans. What the financiers sec is the $10,000,000 a year in old age pensions, the $11,000,000 spent on wheat bonuses, the $38,000,000 on unemployment and farm relief. These are the items they want cut.</span></p>

To make sure that no mistake is made in their policy, they point out the economies that could have been effected in 1931. Here is their list: 1, Spent half as much on unemployment relief; 2, Paid out no wheat bonus; 3, Cut salaries 20% ; 4, Granted no Old Age Pensions; 5, Closed out the National Research Council and abolished grants to scientific institutions.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>The Failure of Humanity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning motor accidents and their cause the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ottawa Journal</span><span class="font10"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The motor vehicles branch of the Ontario department of highways has been collecting detailed statistics of traffic accidents since September, 1930. It has for study the records of 21,758 serious accidents which have occurred since that time, involving 1,303 deaths, injuries to 19,559 persons, property damage to the extent of many millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The conclusion reached by the department makes a point which should not be lost. This is it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Contrary to the opinion held by too many motorists and pedestrians, motor vehicle accidents are not, in the majority of cases, due to the influence of liquor; nor the result of high speeds; nor of defective brakes, tires, glaring headlights or slippery roadways. The»e are all important factors, but the fundamental causes of the great w’astc of life and property rest almost entirely upon the drivers and the pedestrians. Poor judgment, inattention and lack of knowledge as to the proper and safe methods of driving or walking, are the causes of most motor vehicle accidents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not liquor, not high speed, not defective mechanism, not slippery pavements—although all of these are contributing factors—but in the main the failure of the human element in the entity of car and driver. Far too many people arc driving automobiles of great engine power who should be entrusted with nothing more complicated or dangerous than a wheelbarrow, who could not be trusted to wheel a baby carriage; far too many pedestrians go about with a cheerful disregard of their own safety, which may be a sturdy assertion of independence but has little regard for practieal conditions.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>Child Reactions to an Insane Civilization</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The following terrible experience of a young boy of five is reported in the Toronto </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Inspired by the exploits of a character in “penny dreadfuls”, three boys aged 14, 12 and 9 years, respectively, strung Jack, five-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Ivan Pritchard, over a beam in an old chicken coop, lighted a fire under him and reduced him to a condition of hysteria, the child’s father, secretary of the Chatham public utilities commission, revealed today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Shanghaied” by the trio, Jack was bound and taken crying into the hen coop. A rope was thrown over a beam and tied around his body under the arms, then he was hauled clear of the ground. Sticks and paper were piled under him. Telling the child that they would do to him what the villian in their stories did to his victims and that he would never see his mother and father again, the young torturers lighted the papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rescue came when an adult noticed the blaze before Jack was physically injured, but not before he had become hysterical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No charges were laid, he said, and punishment for the perpetrators was arranged privately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The parents promised to see that they were severely chastised. He declined to reveal the name of the adult who had come to the rescue or the names of the boys.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>Effort to Sidetrack Idealism</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">College students in this land have been expressing themselves pretty freely as being opposed to war. The University of Manitoba Debating Union, with many members, and a crowd of non-students have gone on record as opposed to war, and will refuse to “fight for king and country” in the event of a clash of arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Follotving a debate on the subject, such a policy was favored by a four-to-one student vote, and a poll taken of non-students present endorsed the motion by a similar margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Conducted by the University Debating Union, more than 600 persons, attracted by the storm of controversy which similar debates have aroused in Great Britain and eastern Canada, were in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That sueli a sentiment is not pleasing to the authorities in this “Christian” country is revealed in the following item taken from the Victoria </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Influenced by the great interest now being shown over the student world on the subject of war and the strong stand being taken by young intellectuals against fighting, students of Victoria College have been drawing up plans for the wider discussion of a resolution that under “no circumstances would they fight for king and country.” Latest word on this interesting proposal is to the effect that the students have been instructed by the faculty not to draw up the resolution for debate, and in all probability their sentiment will not be recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the Oxford Union let the world know recently about its attitude toward fighting for king and country in world wars, the famous resolution has been passed by students at the universities of Manchester, Glasgow, Toronto and Manitoba, and several in the United States. In addition, the U. S. division of the Student Anti-war Congress, which is nation-wide in its scope, recently sent delegates to a European conference and is supported by some of the republic’s greatest writers and public men. Undoubtedly, after what is happening in the universities of Canada, an attempt will be made to extend the activities of the Congress into Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Too Much Arsenic on the Apples </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Miss Amy Weldon (Scotland)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font10">VERY word you write in regard to your article in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> telling us of the arsenic sprayed upon fruit, is perfectly true. And the gentleman whose letter to you is published in this week’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> wherein he tries to vindicate the use of poisoning all the fruit is ten thousand times worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For till we read his hair-raising account, assuring you that fruit is sprayed as many times as fifteen, with poison, during the season (and condemning your want of knowledge in not knowing this) we had no way of guessing how many sudden deaths were caused by eating sprayed fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In one of the English papers I read that a boy had died after eating four apples, and the cause was proved to be due to the arsenic in the apples, or on the apples. It was but a poor consolation that the editor of the English paper could give readers; all he could suggest is that no one should eat near the core and should cut off all the outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some apples come to table here so filled with a blue-green powder (arsenate of lead) sticking in the hollow, where the stems were, and the apples are so bitter to the taste, due to this fact, that I wrote to the controller of the Health Department here and mentioned the fact. But what could he do ? He was powerless, apparently, for he could but reply that it was not the fault of the fruiterer here, for he would not even know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Could not a law be passed to prevent fruit spraying? Most of our fruit comes, I believe, from America, as being the best. I can only surmise that fruit growers have the choice either of pests’ destroying all their fruits or that their own continued spraying of the fruit may poison those who partake of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(We find others distressed by the information that fruit is so generally sprayed with arsenic compounds. A gentleman who once lived in the apple-growing belt, and who still lives in the state of Washington, wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ ‘ Arsenic in slight amounts has a tonic effect. ’ Who wants to always be taking a tonic? Almost everybody that lives there will tell you to peel your apples before eating; but who wants to eat a peeled apple? I went there with my family and we were all sick for a week from eating sprayed apples and had an awful diarrheea for three days. We learned to wash and dry our own apples. I very seldom eat over two apples at any one time, so the quantity of fruit did not make me sick. To help those that are using sprayed apples: The stem end of the apple collects most of the arsenic, on account of the hollow in that end. As it hangs on the tree, that will fill up and will hold whatever arsenic gets in there; so it is safer to pare away this part of the apple than it is to eat it. The blossom end should also be pared away. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another subscriber comes at this problem from an entirely different angle. The position is taken that in Eden everything was in perfect balance. The birds disposed of the worms. Adam did not have to go around and spray the fruit with arsenate of lead before he dared eat it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And here is a suggestion, from Dr. Arlie Pottle, which approaches the problem from a still different angle:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some ten years ago I was a student of Lindlahr College at Chicago, and in talking to Dr. Lindlahr at his Elmhurst sanitarium, ho told me that his orchard when he took it over was filled with bugs and insects and the crop was absolutely negligible, in fact, hardly worth picking. He conceived the idea that these insects and bugs came there to devour the filth and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the abnormal ingredients of the trees and fruits and that if these things were normal and were supplied with the proper nourishment from the air and soil the bugs would not prevail. Just the same as the human body, it is a known fact that many bacilli and cocci come as a result of diseased conditions rather Hum the producing factor in disease and that by raising the vitality of the body those germs are expelled without use of drugs. Ho worked on his orchard on the same principle, believing that if he supplied a higher vitality to the trees through proper nourishment of the soil and fertilized deeply this could be overcome. Within two yeais be proved his theory to be a fact. He had a splendid crop, never sprayed his trees, and never was bothered with bugs and germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just a suggestion, while the arsenates are still used. A good way to eat an apple is to remove a cone-shaped section from each end. Then bisect the apple crosswise and again remove a cone-shaped section from each half; this will remove both halves of the core. What is left is the eatable portion of the apple, the stem and blossom and core having been removed; the valuable minerals in the skin remain. If the apple was well washed in the first place, wc would not be afraid to eat a peck of them, and would not be concerned whether they had been sprayed or not.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sure Way to Stop Gasoline Leaks </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By T. R.</span><span class="font10"> TITcA’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font10">SIMPLE sure way to stop gasoline-leaking connections on automobiles is as follows: For each connection figure about two inches of common string. Soak this string in a few drops of mucilage. Turn off packing nut, and wind around inside a couple inches of this string, then tighten, and it’s O.K.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have used this method for years, and it’s good. Gasoline will not dissolve mucilage; and a little common string, as a body for the mucilage, permanently stops gasoline leaks. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font10">thought </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Aye</span><span class="font10"> readers might save themselves money by knowing this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">THE VITAL IMPORTANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of a righteous government is being increasingly appreciated by people in all walks of life. The efforts of human governments to establish peace and bring about conditions that will minister to the good of the people continue to fail. The need of light is more and more apparent as men continue to grope in darkness for some remedy, some means of preservation, while the nations continue to slip irresistibly toward destruction. Facing a time of trouble ‘such as was not since there was a nation’ the people must look for preservation to a higher power than that which resides in man. Jehovah is the Preserver of them that trust Him. It is His life-giving truth that is set forth in the following books by Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
