THE COLPORTEUR WORK. 

God has been pleased to specially use and bless the colporteur 
branch of the service. Very largely through this instrumentality 
nearly a million copies of the various volumes of 
MILLENNIAL DAWN series are now scattered throughout this land 
of freedom and intelligence: and these are constantly coming to 
the attention of new readers, here and abroad. 

"THE HARVEST IS GREAT, BUT THE LABORERS ARE FEW." 

"HE THAT REAPETH RECEIVETH WAGES AND GATHERETH FRUIT UNTO 

ETERNAL LIFE." 

This testimony is true now, as it was in the Jewish "harvest;" 



and hence we urge all who are so situated that they can 

engage in this work, to do so. It is one of the best opportunities 

we know of for preaching the true gospel: going from house 

to house all are reached— not only those who attend church services, 

but also those who do not; the latter class including some 

of the true "wheat" who absent themselves because they cannot 

there obtain the spiritual nourishment for which they hunger 

and thirst. 

Do not think of this as a "book business;" for it is no such 
thing. It is "preaching," "evangelizing," "teaching" in the 
truest and best sense of those terms. The Colporteur is one 
with the books and tracts which he circulates, and their teaching 
is associately his teaching. 

This work is open to both brethren and sisters who are not 
hampered by family obligations. It is not merely for those who 
are out of employment and know of nothing more profitable; it is 
specially for those who have talents and employment and who 
desire to sacrifice something for the privilege of being co-workers 
with God in the greatest and grandest work men or angels were 
ever privileged to engage in. "He that is ashamed of me and 
my word, of him will I also be ashamed," said our Savior.

"IF GOD BE FOR US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?" 

-ROMANS 8:31.- 

WHAT wonderful thoughts these words arouse! 
God for us! God on our side! It means almighty 
wisdom enlisted in our interest, almighty power 
to be exerted on our behalf, almighty love and infinite 
goodness watching over us and caring for and helping 
us. What immeasureable lengths and breadths, 
heights and depths of infinite grace are here so forcibly 
and so concisely set before the mind! 

But, we notice a limitation: The Apostle's suggestion 
is not that God is for every one, but for "us." 
To whom does he refer by this word "us?" Is it possible 
that divine love and energy, wisdom and power 
are not being exerted on behalf of the world, but only 
on behalf of the Church in this present time? 

Christian people are divided in their opinion respecting 
this matter. Our Methodist friends and generally 
Universalists and Unitarians hold that God is 

R2376 : page 315 

not for us, the Church, specially; but that he is for 
everybody, everywhere. They hold that he is today 
trying to save everybody, and that he has been so trying 
for the past six thousand years. They must of 
course admit, when making such a claim, that thus far 



the divine plan has failed of success for six thousand 

years; because, men are not saved, and only a small 

proportion have yet had the necessary opportunity for 

salvation; namely, a knowledge of the only "name given 

under heaven or amongst men whereby we must be 

saved." They must realize that the logic of facts is 

against their contention, and against all hope that by 

present methods and arrangements the world would 

ever be converted; for, they are aware that while it is 

claimed in a general way that nearly a million heathen 

have been converted during the last century (and it is 

safe to say that a very large proportion of these are 

not as thoroughly converted as might be desired— that 

comparatively few of them could be termed "saints"), 

yet, during the same time it is estimated that the numbers 

of the heathen have increased, in a natural way, 

to the enormous sum of two hundred millions. How 

long would it require at this rate, at this ratio of conversion, 

one million converts to two hundred million 

births, to convert the world? All can see that such 

hopes are quite illogical. Nevertheless, we can sympathize 

with and greatly appreciate the warmth of 

heart on the part of many of these whose theology we 

now criticise. Many of them— at least the founders 

of the systems— were forced to such conclusions (namely, 

that God is doing the best he can do for the world), 

in opposition to the doctrine of election and foreordination, 

as it has heretofore been misunderstood. 

On the other hand, the great majority of Christian 
people, namely, the various branches of the Presbyterian, 
the Episcopal, the Lutheran, the Baptist and the 
Congregationalist churches deny the theory that God 
has been trying to save the world for the past six 
thousand years and has failed of his purpose. They 
hold, to the contrary, that his purpose has been to select 
or elect out of the world a Church and that this 
work of election has been progressing and will finally 
be consummated; and that thus God's Word through 
the prophets shall be fulfilled, "My Word that goeth 
forth out of my mouth shall not return unto me void; 
but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall 
prosper in the thing whereto I sent it." (Isa. 55:11.) 
They hold that, since all of God's purposes shall be 
accomplished, it can not have been his purpose either 
to have converted the world, or to have brought 
every creature to a knowledge of Christ during the 
past six thousand years; because neither thing has 
been accomplished, therefore neither thing could have 
been purposed. 

We were about to say that we agree with the last 

R2376 : page 316 

mentioned numerous families of Christians in reference 
to the doctrine of election; but we cannot make so 
broad a statement. While we find in the Scriptures 



the declaration that an election is in progress during 
this age especially, and to some extent during all the 
past, yet it is not the kind of election to which such 
large numbers of our Christian friends hold. Their view 
of divine foreordination implies not only the election 
of a Church, but the damnation of all who are not 
elected; and here we must differ; for we find nothing 
of this kind in the Word of the Lord. We find nothing 
in it to imply that all the non-elect are hopelessly 
lost; but, on the contrary, the teaching that the election 
of the Church (Christ the head, the Church his 
body), during this Gospel age, is for the very purpose 
that they as the "seed of Abraham" may fulfil 
the divine plan as expressed in God's promise to 
Abraham, namely, that in this seed (Christ and the 
Church— Gal. 3:16,29), as the heirs of the divine 
promise and benevolent intention, "all the families of 
the earth shall be blessed." Not only is the character 
of the Scriptural election a very different one from 
that which has generally been held by Calvinism, but 
the object of the election is as widely as possible different 
from their conception. We would use the same language 
as our Calvinistic friends in speaking of the 
"us" of our text, in that we would say that it refers 
to the elect Church, but we deny that the damnation 
of all others is either stated or implied. 

In the preceding verses (29,30) the Apostle explains 
the character and methods of the divine selection 
of the elect Church: and we cannot do better than 
notice its details, because so much depends upon 
this point. If we can find in the Apostle's description 
good and sufficient evidence to assure us that we are 
of this elect Church, then we shall have great cause 
for thankfulness, confidence and joy, in realizing that 
God with all his almighty power, and wisdom and love 
is enlisted on our behalf. A great difficulty with many 
seems to be, not that they doubt that there is such an 
election in progress, nor that they doubt that God is 
for some, but that they doubt that they belong to that 
elect class— doubt, therefore, that they are of the "us," 
and that God is for them; and that he is causing all 
things to work together for good to them. 

By reason of their natural constitution, some of the 
humble-minded of the Lord's people lack the confidence 
which they should have, while in some instances others 
who have such confidence, have no real basis for it. 
Knowledge, therefore, clear knowledge of the Apostle's 
argument, is essential to proper faith respecting 
this subject, and proper confidence in God's care over 
those who have been adopted into his family and are 
seeking to make their calling and election sure. Our 
faith is made necessarily dependent to a large extent 
upon our understanding of the divine revelation on 
these subjects. Let us therefore critically examine the 
Apostle's statement with reference to the various steps 
in this election, and note our own connection with the 



same, step by step, that we may know to a certainty 
whether or not we are of the "us" class which he mentions, 
on behalf of whom the Lord's power and wisdom 
are and will be exerted. 

The Apostle begins by asserting divine foreknowledge; 
a divine attribute which will not be questioned 
by any Christian. God not only foreknew the sin that 
would enter into the world through the liberty given 
to father Adam and mother Eve, but he also foresaw 
the fall that would take place as the result of his own 
sentence, and the mental, moral and physical degradation 
which have resulted. Moreover, he foreknew 
that in due time he would send his "Only Begotten 
Son," our Lord, to ransom all from sin and its penalty, 
so that ultimately he might be the Deliverer of all 
who desire to return to harmony with their Creator. 
He not only foreknew the humiliation of our Lord, 
his First-begotten Son, from his condition of glory and 
spiritual nature to the lower conditions of human nature, 
but he foreknew his trials, and his faithfulness 
through them, even unto death, even the death of the 
cross. In all this he foresaw our redemption sacrifice. 
He foresaw also the glory which he designed to bestow 
upon our Lord Jesus following his obedience, as expressed 
by the Apostle Paul, saying, "Him hath God 
highly exalted, and given him a name [title, honor, 
etc.] above every name." 

But our Heavenly Father foreknew and foreordained 
still more than all this,— the selection of the 
Church to be the "body" of Christ, the "bride" of 
Christ, his associate, not only in the sufferings and 
trials of the present life, but also in the subsequent 
glory, and great work of "blessing all the families of 
the earth." This is distinctly stated by the same 
Apostle in his letter to the Ephesians (1:4), where he 
declares that "God hath chosen us in him [Christ] before 
the foundation of the world." The same foreordination 
is distinctly stated by the Apostle Peter, who 
writes to consecrated believers, addressing them, "elect 
according to the foreknowledge of God, the Father, 
through sanctification of the spirit," etc.— 1 Pet. 1:2. 

But the predestination of this verse (Rom. 8:29) 
is not at all what has generally been understood: it is 
not said that God predestinates that some should go to 
heaven and others to eternal torment. That is where 
false human reasoning has corrupted the testimony of 
God's Word and made it of none effect, or worse— of 
bad effect. The Apostle's statement is very clear, that 
God predestinated that all who shall be of this elect, 

R2376 : page 317 

foreknown and foreordained Church in glory must 
first be "conformed to the image of his Son"— or, as the 
literal reading would give it, "copies of his Son." How 
reasonable this predestination, how unreasonable the 



false view! God is calling a number of sons to "glory, 
honor and immortality," and has made Christ Jesus 
the Only Begotten, faithful in every trial, the Head or 
Captain of this foreordained company, whom he has 
since been calling, testing and preparing for the foreordained 
glory. And as it was but a reasonable thing 
that God should determine that if our Lord Jesus would 
be faithful he should receive the highest exaltation, so 
it was equally right and proper that the divine will 
should be forcibly asserted and that he should predestinate 
that none could be of that glorified "body of 
Christ," except as they would become imitators of 
Jesus, who is the firstborn among these his "brethren." 
Having thus stated the matter concisely, the Apostle 
proceeds to apply it to the Church individually, 
and to show the steps which God is taking during this 
Gospel age for the purpose of finding amongst men 
this class which he has foreordained shall be found. 
The Apostle gives the particulars in the following 
verse (30); and altho it is simply stated, it has very 
generally been stumbled over, not only by believers in 
general, but also by theologians, because of two things. 

R2377 : page 317 

(1) The last word of this verse translated "glorified" 
should be translated "honored;" and should be understood 
to refer to the honor conferred upon all who, 

during this age, are brought to any knowledge of 
Christ— the true light. This honor went first to the 
Jews, and selected a "remnant;" but when that nation 
proved unworthy of this "honor" it was turned to the 
Gentiles, to gather out of them a peculiar people, a 
holy nation, to bear the name of Christ. (Acts 15:14.) 

(2) The reader naturally expects the Apostle to begin 
with present conditions and trace them up to the grand 
result— the glorified Church,— while on the contrary 
the Apostle very properly begins at the other end, and 
traces the results downward. He does not begin, as 

is generally supposed, by saying, God honored you 
with the knowledge of the Gospel of Christ, and when 
you believed he justified you, and after you were justified 
he called you, and if you are faithful to your 
calling he will by and by exalt you to the condition 
which he foreknew. Indeed, it would not be possible 
to state the matter truthfully from that side; because, 
many are honored with a knowledge of the Gospel of 
Christ who are never justified (because they do not 
accept the knowledge— do not accept Christ), and 
of those who do accept Christ and who are thus 
justified, it would not be true to say that they will 
all be sanctified; nor would it be correct to say 
that all who once are sanctified will reach the condition 
of glory; for "many are called but few chosen:" 
few "make their calling and election sure." 
But the Apostle argues the matter from the only 



proper and logical standpoint: having stated that God 
has foreknown or fore-intended the election of the 
Church, he steps forward to the time when God's purpose 
and intention will have been completed, accomplished 
—the time when the election will be finished 
and the Church accepted to glory. From that future 
standpoint he indicates the various steps which led up 
to it, saying,— All those of the foreknown ones, glorified, 
will previously have been called; because it is a matter of 
grace, and no man taketh this honor unto himself, 
but "he that is called of God;"— as the "Head of the 
body," so each member of the body. And, says the 
Apostle, every one thus "called" will previously have 
been "justified;" because God calls no enemies, no unreconciled 
sinners, to this high position. It was for 
this reason that Christ died, that through faith in his 
blood repentant believers might be "justified" and 
might be thus prepared to be "called." It is thus 
evident that the high calling to this glorious position 
of joint-heirship with Christ is a very different thing, 
indeed, from the calling of sinners to repentance. Sinners 
are called to repentance anywhere and everywhere 
and at any time. And when they repent, the Lord 
engages that in due time he will point them to 
"The fountain filled with blood, 

Drawn from Immanuel's veins; 
Where sinners plunged beneath that flood 
Lose all their guilty stains." 

When they have lost their guilty stains, through 
repentance and faith in the Redeemer, they have 
reached the condition of justification, and are ready to 
be "called" to sonship and joint-heirship. But the 
Apostle is still going backward in the argument and, 
having told that the foreordained class would all be 
"called," and that they would all previously have 
been "justified," he declares that the justified ones 
would all previously have been favored or "honored" 
(not glorified): honored or favored with a knowledge of 
the truth, a knowledge of the gospel. 

Perhaps only a comparatively small number of 
Christians have realized what a great honor was conferred 
upon them in the first knowledge brought to 
them of the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of 
the world. This "honor" has been so widely dispensed 
that many forget that it is a special honor, a special 
favor, just as they forget to recognize as special blessings 
the sunshine and the rain. But this "honor" is 
not yet as common as some other of God's blessings. 
"He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the 
good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust," 
throughout the whole world: but not so the gospel 

R2377 : page 318 

sunlight and the spiritual showers. These blessings 
have been general only in certain quarters. 



"THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD IS JESUS." 



When Christ as the "Great Light" arose in Palestine, 
and when on the day of Pentecost the Church 
was illuminated by him, as a light for the world,— that 
light was not sent Southward into the darkness of Africa: 
the Africans were not "honored" with having 
the gospel of Christ. Neither was it sent Eastward 
through India to its hundreds of millions: India was 
not "honored" with the gospel of Christ. Neither was 
it sent still farther East to the hundreds of millions of 
China: China was not "honored" with the gospel of 
Christ. But it was sent Northward and Westward 
through and to Europe and America. These lands were 
"honored," these peoples "have seen a great light," 
and with that light have received a great blessing. But 
how comparatively few have really seen this light, 
even when it shone around them on every hand. Alas ! 
like the partly cured blind man of old they see a brightness 
and can discern something, but see nothing clearly. 
The Apostle explains their case, saying, "The 
god of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that 
believe not."-2 Cor. 4:4. 

Having followed the Apostle's reasoning, we are 
enabled to see clearly each step of divine providence 
taken in connection with the divine purpose and 
foreordination. 

(1) We see that first of all, to a certain extent, 

God was "for" us, for the people of Europe and North 
America: he was for them or favorable to them to the 
extent of "honoring" or favoring them with the light 
of grace "as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ, our 
Lord." 

(2) In a still fuller sense God was "for" or favorable 
towards those who accept the light of truth, those 

who through repentance and faith in the precious blood 
are "justified" from sin, through his grace. 

(3) He was yet more "for" these justified ones, 
to the extent that he "called" them,— to suffer with 
Christ during this Gospel age, and by and by to share 
his glory. 

(4) In a still fuller sense he is "for" all those who 
accept the call and who are seeking to "make their 
calling and election sure." God is in an especial sense 
"for" all these who are so running as to obtain the 
prize which he offers. "They shall be mine, in that 
day when I make up my jewels." 

It is to this called and faithfully running class 
that the Apostle speaks as "us." He and those whom 
he addressed ("called to be saints"— Rom. 1:6,7) had 
first been "honored" with the light; second, they, by 
repentance and faith, had accepted it and been justified; 
third, they had been "called;" fourth, they had 



accepted the calling and given themselves wholly to 
the Lord. And with the Apostle and the early Church 
all who to-day can recognize themselves in this same 
position, as having taken these same steps, may properly 
apply to themselves the Apostle's words and 
say, God is for us. Who can be against us! 

All the "saints" throughout the whole world, 
who have taken the afore-mentioned steps, are probably 
altogether not a great multitude; but rather, comparatively, 
a "little flock:" yet each one of these may 
say to himself, and realize to the very bottom of his 
heart as applicable to himself, these wonderful words, 
—God is for us. He may endeavor to grasp the significance 
of these words, but he will surely fail of getting 
all of their wonderful meaning. It is not possible 
for the human mind to grasp the riches of divine 
grace and love and power. We cannot comprehend 
them, we can merely apprehend them. If God be for 
us, with all of his infinite wisdom and power, it implies 
also that Christ is for us, for he is one with the Father; 
it implies also that all the angels, Cherubim and Seraphim, 
and all the heavenly powers of our knowledge 
and beyond our knowledge are for us;— all enlisted 
upon our side, to do us good, to help us, to succor us 
in time of need, to uphold us in time of temptation, to 
strengthen us to do the Father's will. "All things 
are yours, for ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's." 

The view granted to Elisha's servant, of countless 
horses, chariots and horsemen of fire or like fire, was 
of course merely a vision, nevertheless it represented 
a truth,— that divine power is round about God's people 
on every hand for their protection and their deliverance. 
"The angel of the Lord encampeth round 
about them that are his and delivereth them." "Are 
they [the angels] not all ministering spirits sent forth 
to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation?" 
(Heb. 1:14.) Our Lord expressed the same thing, 
saying, of his faithful followers: "Their angels [messengers] 
do always behold the face of my Father." It 
matters not whether we shall understand this to signify 
that spirit beings continually surround those called 
to be the "elect" of the Lord, to guide and shape their 
interests for their highest good, or whether we shall 
understand it to be merely a figure of speech, signifying 
that divine power surrounds God's people; for the 
results would be the same, it matters not by which 
means the Lord would deliver them from the evil and 
help them in trial and adversity. The fact that God 
is "for us," and that he is making all things to work 
together for good to those who love him, is the central 
thought, the essence, the strength of this message to 
"us." 

How wonderful is all this! Let us cast our minds 

R2377 : page 319 



for a moment over the world with its fifteen hundred 
millions of inhabitants. Let us remember that they 

R2378 : page 319 

are all under the "curse," under the sentence of divine 

displeasure, except the few who have heard of the redemption 

—of the Way, the Truth and the Life— and 

who have by faith and obedience "escaped the condemnation 

that is on the world" and come back into harmony 

with the Father and into fellowship with his 

Son. Let us imagine, if we can, this "little flock" of 

the "honored," "justified" and "called," heaven-led 

and heaven-blessed, scattered here and there amongst 

the fifteen hundred million fellow-creatures. O, what 

joy, what comfort, what peace, what strength the 

thought must bring to each one who can realize that 

he has taken all of these steps thus far, and that he is 

still pressing along the same line "for the mark of the 

prize of our high calling ! " And this joy is not dimmed, 

but is greatly enhanced, by the thought that soon, in conformity 

with God's gracious foreordination, all the 

"elect" may have a share in the great work of blessing, 

with the knowledge of the True Light, the masses 

who are yet in darkness, "without God and having no 

hope" in him. For altho a redemption has been provided 

for all, the knowledge of God's grace has not 

yet reached any but the favored or "honored" minority. 

As the Apostle declares in this very same chapter 
(Rom. 8:22), it is indeed a groaning creation; it has 
been groaning ever since the sentence of divine wrath 
was expressed in Eden, and it must continue to groan 
until the great Deliverer shall have established his 
Kingdom, and shall have rolled back the "curse" of 
death and depravity. Oh, what riches of grace have 
come to "us" through Jesus Christ, our Lord! And 
yet, as the Apostle says, altho we have all this blessing 
and favor, we have also with it certain trials, difficulties 
and painful experiences, which the Father sees 
necessary for our development in order that we may 
come up to the terms of his predestination, "copies of 
his Son." And in consequence of this, as the Apostle 
declares, "We ourselves also [as well as the whole creation] 
groan within ourselves [while suffering with 
the world we suppress the groan,— "We lay our burdens 
at his feet and bear a song away"] waiting for 
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body"— 
"the body of Christ," the elect Church. 

The word if in this text does not signify a doubt 
or question on the subject; but quite the reverse. The 
Apostle has given the evidence that God is for "us," 
in the preceding verses, and now uses if as tho he 
said,— If I have proved that God is for us, then who 
can be against us! 

"WHO CAN BE AGAINST US?" 



Who can be against us, if God is for us? The 
Apostle does not mean that, having God on our side, 
none would dare to oppose our way. Quite to the contrary, 
we have bitter enemies and relentless foes. Who 
are against us?— Their name is legion. The devil is 
against us, as the Apostle declares, Our adversary, the 
devil, goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he 
may devour. The same Apostle assures us that we 
must contend against "the wiles of the devil." Our 
Lord declares that we must "resist the devil." The 
Apostle informs us that Satan is cunning and deceitful, 
as well as desperately wicked; and says that therefore 
we must have a battle, and as good soldiers we 
must have on the armor of God, and use it faithfully. 
Thus we are to resist the devil, and he will flee from 
us. We are to "quench all the fiery darts of the adversary" 
in open attacks, and yet to remember that 
we battle not with flesh and blood, but with a demon 
host; with "principalities and powers and spiritual 
wickedness in high places."— Eph. 6:12. 

Nor is this all: we have a great enemy in ourselves; 
—the "carnal mind," "the old man," reckoned 
dead, which must be kept in subjection. Perhaps the 
greatest battles and the greatest trials, which we are 
called upon as "new creatures" to endure, are these 
battles of the new self, the mind of Christ, against the 
old fallen self, the mind of the flesh. 

Furthermore: we have the "world" as "children 
of darkness" arrayed in opposition to us. They love 
the darkness and consequently hate not only the light, 
but also the "children of the light." This our Master 
declared, saying, "Ye are not of the world, for I have 
chosen you out of the world." "Marvel not if the 
world hate you; you know it hated me before it hated 
you." "If ye were of the world, the world would love 
its own; but now ye are not of the world, therefore the 
world hateth you." And the world's hatred is not 
conducted along honorable lines of warfare. It would 
be ashamed to declare that it loved darkness, and 
ashamed to declare that it hated us because of the 
light. Its policy, rather, guided by the great adversary, 
is, to "put light for darkness, and darkness for 
light:" to misrepresent our best efforts to be evil and 
selfish, and to misrepresent its own selfish efforts as being 
honorable and good. "Marvel not, if the world 
hate you." "The darkness hateth the light." 

Nor are these great adversaries the only ones to 
oppose us: we must expect to endure from still another 
quarter. As our Lord declared, "A man's foes shall 
be they of his own household." Those whom you 
have dearly loved of your own family circle, and with 
whom you have had Christian fellowship, may turn 
against you and hate you for the truth's sake. Nor 



will this always be because of wickedness of intention: 
sometimes at least the persecutions will come conscientiously; 
as for instance, Saul of Tarsus (who afterward 

R2378 : page 320 

became the great Apostle Paul) was once a persecutor 
of "this way," and ignorantly did many things 
against Jesus and those who loved him. He himself 
tells us that he obtained mercy because he did it ignorantly, 
thinking that he did God service. And so 
doubtless it has been with much of the persecution 
that has come to the Lord's faithful ones in every age. 
Much of it has been inflicted conscientiously. It is 
quite remarkable, too, how the Adversary succeeds 
sometimes in deceiving those, who once knew better, 
into thinking that anger, malice, hatred, strife, bitter 
words and slander ("works of the flesh and the devil") 
are "duty." Alas, how blinding is the spirit of 
the Adversary ! 

All these adversaries must be resisted, unto blood, 
unto death, if need be,— must not be permitted to hinder 
our walking in the footsteps of him who set us an 
example,— must not be permitted to prevent us from 
becoming copies of our Lord and thus making our calling 
and election sure. But while resisting them with 
all our might, we must avoid carnal weapons and not 
render railing for railing; rather, so far as possible, we 
should use the sword of the spirit, the Word of God, 
and Michael-like say, "The Lord rebuke thee." God 
is "for us," and declares that in his due time he will 
right present wrongs and falsehoods, saying, "Vengeance 
is mine, I will render recompences." Indeed, 
toward the class who war against us ignorantly and 
conscientiously we should feel no bitterness, but rather 
sympathy, love and an earnest desire and effort for an 
opening of the eyes of their understanding. 

The Apostle was not ignoring all of these great 
adversaries which, like "roaring lions," would terrify 
us, and if possible arrest our progress in the path of 
consecration and sacrifice, which leads on to glory. 
This is not his thought when he says, "If God be for 
us, who can be against us?" Quite to the contrary, 
his thought is, that notwithstanding all these things 
which are against us, we may realize that God is for us, 
that he has predestinated a Church in glory and has 
justified and called us to be members of it, and brought 
us on the journey thus far, through all of these various 
steps. And if we can realize that God has thus been 
leading us up to the present time, to bring us to share 
his glory, and that all things thus far have been working 
for our good, this is our assurance that all wisdom, 
power and love shall be exerted on our behalf down to 
the very end of the racecourse, if we continue to abide 
in Christ, faithfully. 

What shall we fear? What could oppose our way 



so as to hinder it, if God be on our side? This reminds 
us of the adage, "God with one is a majority." So, 
God with us, and for us, and leading us, makes us 
mighty indeed, stronger than all these adversaries with 
all their arts and wiles and perversity, and able through 
his grace to come off conquerors, yea, more than conquerors 
through him who loved us and bought us with 
his own precious blood. 

We urge that each reader mark the various steps 
of progress through which divine grace has already led 
him, and that, whatever he finds to be his present 
standpoint, he go on as the Lord leads,— not content 
with anything short of "the whole counsel of God." 
The reader has been "honored" with a knowledge of 
the grace of God in Christ: if he has not yet accepted, 
let him quickly accept this grace by repentance for sin 
and with faith in the ransom. If he has done this and 
has received the grace of justification, and, as the 
Apostle expresses it, has "joy and peace through believing," 
then let him remember that still there's 
more to follow, and that the justified are "called." 
Not called to glory merely, but called to obedience, 
called to present their bodies living sacrifices to God in 
his service, holy and acceptable through Christ. 

Alas! how many who have received the grace of 
justification stop there: they hear the call to suffer 
with Christ for the truth's sake, they hear the invitation 
to stand up for Jesus, in their thoughts and words 
and deeds, but heed not. They perceive that such a 
full consecration would necessarily mean not only the 
giving up of sinful pleasures, but also the giving up of 
some not sinful, that they might devote their words 
and thoughts and deeds as far as possible as he did, 
doing good to others. But of those who hear the call 
to present themselves, how few obey it, how few surrender 
themselves to him who bought them with his 

R2379 : page 320 

own precious blood! Yes, many are called; tho few 

are chosen. All the justified are called to self-surrender, 

full obedience, full trust in the Lord and full submission 

to his will. And of those who do accept the 

call and who have made the covenant, and who are 

therefore of the "us" class mentioned by the Apostle, 

how many become "overcharged with the cares of this 

life, or the deceitfulness of riches," or the perplexities 

of poverty, and so fail to obtain the fullness of heart-obedience, 

and consequently will fail to make their 

calling and election sure. 

We are not now discussing what will be the fate 
of those who fail to be victors and to gain a crown and 
to sit with Christ in his throne; we are considering, 
rather, the privileges of those who have been "honored" 
of the Lord and led step by step up to present 
attainments of knowledge and privilege. We are seeking 



to bring before our minds at least a faint conception 
of the wonderful provisions of divine grace, and 
the full ability of every one so called to make his calling 
and election sure by laying hold of this grace of 
God, provided in Christ, by which, to them, all things 
shall work together for good, because they love God 
and are the called ones according to his purpose.

A QUESTION IN RE JUSTIFICATION. 



Rhode Island. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-There is some difference 
of opinion amongst the friends here respecting a point 
of Scripture teaching, and we request your aid in its solution 
at your earliest convenience and, if you think 
proper, in the columns of the WATCH TOWER. Briefly 
stated, it is this:— What is the faith taught in God's 
Word, by which the sinner is justified in God's sight? 

With Christian love, Yours in our Lord, 

G. W. A . and J. B . 

IN REPLY:— It is faith in "the redemption which is 
in Christ Jesus," that justifies the sinner. But this implies 
much more than appears on the surface— much 
more than many suppose. It implies:— 

(1) That the sinner recognizes his own condition 

of imperfection, sin, separation from God, and his sentence, 
even if he does not understand fully and correctly 
what the penalty for sin is— death, destruction. It 
implies this, because to admit that God has provided a 
redemption implies that there was need for redemption 
on the part of the sinner, and that a condemnation rested 
upon the sinner justly, because of sin. 

(2) Faith in this redemption implies that the sinner 
discerns at least something of the sinfulness of sin; 
and that he desires to escape, not only from the extreme 
penalty of sin (death, destruction), but also from the 

other features; viz., his own imperfections and his alienation 
from the divine mind. Such a faith, therefore, 
implies repentance— a desire to return unto God and to 
righteousness. It means, therefore, dissatisfaction with 
sin, and a longing desire for righteousness, which is 
willing, yea, glad, to avail itself of the divine provision 
in Christ. This faith, therefore, implies not only a desire 
for the forgiveness of "the sins that are past through 
the forebearance of God," but also a desire to live godly, 
righteously, soberly, and to henceforth avoid all sin, 
so far as possible. 

(3) This faith is said to justify us in the divine 

sight: that is, God, through the merit of the great sacrifice, 



can be just in recognizing those who, altho still 
blemished by sin, and unworthy actually of his notice, 
have thus, by his appointed way, through the merit of 
the redemption, come back to a condition of mind, of 
heart, which he can thoroughly approve. 

(4) It is called justification by faith, because it is 

not an actual justification. An actual justification would 
mean that the sinner was made absolutely perfect or 
correct, but a justification by faith signifies that, altho 
actually imperfect, still he is now accepted of the Lord, 
and treated by him as tho he were perfect, because his 
heart or intentions are now perfect, and the sacrifice for 
sins, in which by faith he has shared, is reckoned as covering 
all his past shortcomings. 

(5) This new condition of justification, having 

been entered upon, implies, therefore, as we have seen, 

a determination upon the part of the justified one to 

live in thought, word and deed righteously, to the extent 

of his ability. At first this may seem to him to be 

a comparatively easy thing— simply to do right, and to 

avoid doing wrong. But whoever tries to do this will 

shortly find that it is no easy task, that the weaknesses 

and tendencies of his own fallen nature, and similar weaknesses 

in those with whom he daily and hourly comes 

in contact, have a tendency to oppose his resolves for 

a life of righteousness, justice, equity, toward God and 

men. He finds the necessities of life and the conditions 

of the world, socially and financially, to be a strong 

current, to be against which would imply much more 

than he had at first thought. As he looks the question 

squarely and honestly in the face, he finds that neither 

his own flesh, nor the world in general, are friends to 

grace to help him on to God, and that the only thing 

to do is either to join with the majority in unfaithfulness 

to the highest sense of righteousness, truth and 

love, or else to reckon himself dead to the world— a 

living sacrifice to God and his righteousness. 

(6) This is a turning-point in the pathway 

of all the justified during the Gospel age. There is no 
escaping it. They must either go onward to a full consecration 
to the Lord (Rom. 12:1), or they must retrograde 
from the standard of righteousness, and be content 
to avoid the grosser sins, and to live on the common 
plane of nominal Church worldliness. This the 
majority seem to do. So far as we may be able to judge, 
they, in thus compromising themselves, lose their position 
of justification, which was reckoned to them at the 

R2384: page 321 

time of their earliest faith and resolves to follow righteousness, 

justice and truth. Their justification remained 

so long as they were conscientiously doing this. Their 

justification would seem to lapse from the moment that, 

coming to the place where they realized that obedience 

to righteousness in this present time would mean self-sacrifice, 



they turned back and followed no further in 

the footsteps of him who has set us an example that 

we should walk in his steps. 

(7) Some, yea many, stop when they reach the 
point of decision: unwilling to compromise righteousness, 
and yet unwilling to bear the reproaches and losses 
or sacrifices demanded by a life of full consecration. 
These show that they have the spirit of the truth, 
tho not in overcoming measure,— not in the measure 
of sacrificers, "priests." These the Lord bears with 
patiently for a time, peradventure under his disciplines 
and the instructions of his Word they may see their 
privileges and learn that the things they would sacrifice 
are but loss and dross as compared with the glory, honor 
and immortality they would gain. If these do not learn 
the lesson and make the sacrifice they will ultimately 
be forced by divine providences to the point of decision 

R2384 : page 322 

with its reward of everlasting life or its punishment of 
everlasting death. 

But such as need to be forced are not to be counted 
amongst the overcomers, the "elect," the "little flock," 
who will sit in the throne with the Lord. No, they are 
represented in the undetermined number who will come 
up to spiritual conditions through great tribulation.— 
See Rev. 7:9-17. 

If we have not fully answered your question, it is 
because we have failed to get at its point, and if so, 
please state it again.

HEZEKIAH'S GREAT PASSOVER. 

-NOV. 6.-2 CHRON. 30:1-13.- 

"Yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary. 

OUR LAST lesson respecting Isaiah's vision and 
his commission, to announce the fall of Israel, 
was "in the year that King Uzziah died." (Isa. 6:1.) 
The wicked king, Ahaz, succeeded Uzziah in the throne 
of Judah, and reigned wickedly, in neglect of God and 
his law, for sixteen years. It would appear, however, 
that he had an excellent wife, Abijah, under whose careful 
training their son, Hezekiah, was prepared for the 
kingdom, and became in many respects a model ruler, 
and a faithful servant of God. It is even supposed that 
the Prophet Isaiah, who was related to the royal family, 
was Hezekiah's tutor, and helped to guide him into 
right ways of thinking and doing. The fact that so 
good a son could come of so evil a father is an evidence 



to us that under divine providence it is not necessary 
that we should inherit all the evil traits of our ancestors. 
Altho we cannot overcome them completely, so that 
none of the fallen race of Adam can ever hope to regain 
perfection as a result of personal effort and of training, 
nevertheless, we see that favorable conditions, religious 
training, etc., lead to a vast improvement in those who 
are rightly exercised thereby. 

And here we get a suggestive hint of the methods 
which the Lord will employ in the world's blessing and 
uplifting during the Millennium. The human family 
is unable to lift itself out of the degraded condition in 
which it is, because of shortness of life, and because of 
the general prevalence of evil; hence, the power that 
will lift mankind must be a power from the outside, uncontaminated 
by the fall. Moreover, under the terms 
of the divine sentence, the penalty of man's sin must 
be cancelled, his penalty must be paid for him, before 
he can be fully released from its condemnation and 
weaknesses. It is this redemption or purchase which 
has already been accomplished for mankind: the deliverance 
out of sin and its consequences, mental, moral 
and physical depravity, is a future work, made possible 
by Christ's great sacrifice. And, gracious thought, 
it is he who redeemed mankind, and who has been 
highly exalted to power and great glory, who is shortly 
to use this power on man's behalf, in uplifting to righteousness 
and perfection whosoever will accept his grace, 
of all the families of the earth. The uplifting, nevertheless, 
will be along lines of instruction, chastisement 
and correction in righteousness, in which the individual 
will be obliged to cooperate in order to the attainment 
of full "restitution of all things, which God hath spoken 
by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world 
began. "--Acts 3:19-21. 

That Hezekiah was already well instructed, and 
thoroughly consecrated to the Lord, at the time of his 
father's death and his own entrance to kingship, is evidenced 
by the fact that he immediately began, in the 
first month of his reign, to inaugurate reforms of the 
character noted in our lesson,— the restoration of the 
worship of Jehovah, as divinely appointed. Had he 
not been consecrated to the Lord, and thus in the proper 
attitude of heart, his accession to power would have had 
an influence the very opposite of this: it would have led 
to self-gratification and personal vanity. 

His first public work was to open and prepare the 
Temple of the Lord, which had been closed and out of 
repair for years, and in which had been permitted to 
accumulate a vast amount of rubbish, etc. The king 
called to his aid the proper assistants for this work— 
the divinely appointed tribe of Levi. The cleansing of 
the Temple proceeded according to the law of Moses, 
and when completed the first thing in order was a great 
sin-offering. King Hezekiah was broadminded, and 
gave special instructions that the offering was to be, not 



only on behalf of the people of Judah, the two tribes, 
but on behalf also of their separated brethren— "for all 
Israel." He recognized properly that the nation was 
still in some respects one, in the sense that the divine 
promises were made to all the seed of Abraham: whoever, 
therefore, of all the tribes would recognize the 
Lord God and seek his face was properly to be esteemed 
a brother-Israelite. 

It was the time for the Passover Feast, in commemoration 
of the Lord's deliverance of Israel from Egypt; 
typical of the deliverance of Spiritual Israel from the 
bondage of sin and Satan; and typical also of the ultimate 
deliverance of those who love righteousness, and 
desire to serve the Lord, from Satan's bondage, by his 
complete overthrow during the Millennium. It was 
determined that this Passover Feast should be properly 
observed that year, for, altho, from the account, it had 
evidently been kept by a few Israelites, yet the general 

R2379 : page 323 

religious disorder was such, that apparently it was not 
observed by the nation, nor with all its appointed particularity 
by any. This time the king determined that 
its proper observance should be reinaugurated, preceded 
by all the proper arrangements of the law respecting 
the cleansing of the people (Exod. 12:15-20) and the 
putting away from their houses of leaven, a symbol of 
sin: thus, in figure at least, typically, the people were 
sanctified, in order that they might properly keep the 
feast. But all this required time— to issue the decrees, 
to succeed in stimulating the zeal of the people, and on 
their part to perform these works, symbolizing holiness 
to the Lord and separation from sin. The nation being 
thus defiled, the time was too short to be ready to observe 
the Passover on its appointed day, the 14th day 
of the first month, and hence the 14th day of the second 
month was observed instead— as the Lord had given 
permission.— Num. 9:10,11. 
The same breadth of mind and heart which characterized 

R2380 : page 323 

Hezekiah's instructions that the sin-offering 
should be on behalf of all Israel, still controlled him, 
and led him to desire not only a reformation of "Judah," 
but also amongst their separated brethren, known as 
"Israel." Accordingly, special messengers were sent, 
from Beer-Sheba, the most southern town of the land 
of Israel, to publicly invite all Israelites of every tribe 
to return to the worship of Jehovah, and to specially 
come up on the occasion of this feast. The postal system 
of the present day was not in vogue, and hence a 
special postal arrangement was made for the carrying 
of these letters. 
The time for such an invitation was most favorable, 



for the prophecy of Isaiah respecting the carrying away 
of Israel into captivity was already in progress: the ten 
tribes were at this date paying tribute to Assyria, and 
the carrying away of many of the people had already 
actually begun. Thus, the Lord's arrangement served 
to draw attention of any who might be "Israelites indeed" 
to the fact that their captivity was a punishment 
for their rejection of the Lord, and thus to incite those 
who had any faith and zeal to return to the Lord's worship. 
King Hezekiah's letters, briefly summed up, 
were an exhortation to remember the past and to return 
to Jehovah: "Be not ye like your fathers and like your 
brethren, which trespass against the Lord God of your 
fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye 
see... .Yield yourselves unto the Lord, and enter 
into his sanctuary,...that the fierceness of his wrath 
may turn away from you." 

The exhortation held out the suggestion, not only 
of present deliverance, but also of the return of their 
brethren already deported. But the postmen who bore 
these messages were laughed at in the northern kingdom. 
In proportion as the people were far from the 
Lord they were proud and vain, as is always the case; 
and it was in large measure, no doubt, their pride that 
was leading them on to destruction as a nation. All 
who are in harmony with the Lord are humbleminded, 
and only such receive the Lord's gracious messages with 
appreciation or love and well entreat the servants who 
bear the messages. We may note also that their obedience 
under such circumstances would imply considerable 
faith and devotion to Jehovah, for they would be 
the subjects of the scoffs and scorns from the unbelieving 
masses, as well as the messengers who invited them. 
Some, but not many, we are told, yet in all a fair 
number, humbled themselves and came, from the tribes 
of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulon, and of course got 
the blessing which God always grants to those who 
humble themselves and are obedient. In addition to 
this mention in verse 11, we find another, that "many" 
came also from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, 
Issachar and Zebulon. (Verse 18.) Thus, at least 
five of the ten tribes were represented more or less numerously, 
and of the remainder two were already in 
captivity,— Reuben and Gad. We are to remember, 
furthermore, that some from the ten tribes had already 
allied themselves with the kingdom of Judah, because 
of the idolatry prevalent in their own land and of the 
better religious opportunities in Judah.— 2 Chron. 15:9. 

Throughout Judah the invitation to the Feast of 
the Passover seems to have been well received: "The 
hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment 
of the king and of the princes by the Word 
of the Lord." In consequence there was an unusually 
large assemblage of the people at Jerusalem that 
year. The record is, that no such Passover had been 
observed since the days of Solomon,— over two hundred 



and fifty years. The Feast was observed with 
great joy and gladness, singing and praising God; and 
so imbued did the people become with religious fervor, 
that it was by their own proposition that the Passover 
week of praise and sanctity to holy things was prolonged 
for an additional week.— Verses 21-26. 

We break from our topic here, to call attention to 
the fact that the true faithful Israelites were gathered 
out of the ten tribe kingdom into the two tribe kingdom 
at that early day. After the later captivity of Judah 
the division of Israel was lost sight of. The decree of 
Cyrus permitting return from captivity ignored any division 
and was to all Israel: and the faithful of all the 
tribes who returned were unitedly recognized as Israel, 
and are subsequently so referred to in the Bible. Use a 
concordance and note the New Testament references to 
Israel. It was the remnant of Israel and not merely of 
Judah that was gathered into the Gospel age, while the 
remainder were "blinded" and broken off from the 
covenant promises, until after the Gospel age shall have 

R2380 : page 324 

selected the "elect," Spiritual Israel.— See 
Rom. 11:7,25-32. 

Nor did the revival of true religion inaugurated by 
Hezekiah stop with that Passover. While it filled the 
people with zeal for the true worship of the Lord, to 
give liberally for the support of the priests and Levites, 
the maintenance of the sacrifices, etc., it led also to a 
strong movement against every form of idolatry throughout 
Judah, extending even throughout the land of the 
ten tribes: as a consequence, there was a general destruction 
of idols out of the land, a cutting down of the 
obscene high places, devoted to the licentious worship 
of Baal, etc. The result of this proper turning of the 
people to the Lord brought to them and to their king 
great earthly blessings, in harmony with God's covenant 
made with that nation. The king became very 
rich, and the people also, so that their tithes and offerings 
to the Lord were not only sufficient for the supply 
of the priests and Levites, but far in excess of this, so 
that store-houses had to be built to receive them. 

Looking for analogies in Spiritual Israel, we find 
several. (1) All true religion is identical with order 
and cleanliness, as the Apostle intimates, saying, If any 
man defile the Temple of God, him God will destroy, 
and correspondingly we may say that whoever attempts 
to cleanse the Temple of God, and to bring it into accord 
with the divine arrangement will be blessed now, 
as were Hezekiah and his kingdom, only we should remember 
that the rewards promised to Spiritual Israel 
are spiritual and not temporal blessings. As heretofore 
noticed, the congregation of the Lord in the present 
time may be considered nominally his Temple, tho the 
real Temple is the Church triumphant, not yet completed. 



Nevertheless, it is proper also to apply this 
lesson to our own individual hearts; for, as the Apostle 
also points out, each Christian is a temple of the holy 
spirit, and the Church in general, therefore, may be 
properly considered, even in its present imperfect condition, 
a temple of the holy spirit, devoted, consecrated, 
to the Lord. So then, each individual Christian, 
justified and sanctified by the great atonement of our 
High Priest, should seek to keep himself (and, so far 
as possible, all others associated with him, and imbued 
by the same spirit) free from all worldly contamination, 
if they would have the Lord's blessing in spiritual 
things. All of the Lord's people need to remember the 
necessity for cleansing from worldly defilements, not 
only those of the past, but also those which are ever 
present in the world. We remember the Apostle's 
words, "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of 
the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of 
God."-2Cor. 7:1. 

Not only should the cleansing be done, but it should 
be done according to the divine arrangement. As Hezekiah 
and the priests and Levites cleansed and sanctified 
"according to the law of Moses," the mediator of Israel's 
covenant, so we, who belong to the house of sons, 
are to seek cleansing and sanctification in strict accordance 
with the law of Christ, the Mediator of the New 
Covenant, under which "we are accepted in the beloved." 
As there was a formal ritual to be observed under 
the law, so there is a form of faith, of sound words 
and of obedience, to be observed under the Gospel. Our 
cleansing is not with the blood of bulls and goats, but 
through the merit of the more precious blood of Christ, 
which does not call for vengeance upon us because of 
his death, but on the contrary calls for mercy, pardon, 
grace, to all those who come unto the Father by him. 

(2) There is a lesson for us also in Hezekiah's 
broad conception that all Israelites who were willing to 
join in the worship of the Lord were to be esteemed as 
brethren, and to be invited so to do. Nor would it have 
been sufficient that he should have broad and liberal 
and Scriptural ideas on this subject: it was his duty, as 
well as his privilege, to make sure that there were no 
fences of separation between any of the Lord's people, 
and the arrangement for the Lord's worship in the 
Lord's house, the Temple. So with Spiritual Israelites, 
there should be a realization that all "Israelites indeed" 
are one in Christ Jesus, and all are to be esteemed and 
treated as Israelites indeed who trust in the precious 
blood of Christ, as the great sin-offering of atonement, 
and are consecrated to the service of the Lord. Such 
a general recognition of Christian character is, we are 
glad to believe, greatly on the increase during the last 
half century. But more is still to be done along proper 
lines: sectarian fences should all be pulled down and sectarian 
names and creeds all be abolished, and true 
Christians (all who trust in the precious blood, and are 



fully consecrated to the Lord, to obey the instructions 
of his Word as best they can understand them) should 
mingle together, and be one people, without other distinctions 
than that some may have attained to greater 
knowledge and sanctification than others— all, however, 
seeking to "come to the full stature of manhood in 
Christ Jesus." 

(3) There is a lesson for us also in the fact that 

such a message of true fellowship to the true Israel, and 
in the promises of God, made alike to all, and ignoring 

R2381 : page 324 

all creeds and parties, would not be popular to-day, as 
it was not popular with many at that time. Now, as 
then, the majority are disposed to "laugh with scorn," 
and to mark as visionary enthusiasts those who advocate 
the simplicity which is in Christ Jesus, as taught in the 
Scriptures, and practiced in the early Church. Nevertheless, 
now as then, some are attracted by what they 
realize to be the proper message, the truth. Many will 
hear the message, no doubt, who will not have sufficient 

R2381 : page 325 

courage to act upon it, as no doubt there were some 

in Israel. A few, nevertheless, from almost all sects 

and parties and creeds will be attracted; and they will 

be found to be the meek, those ready and willing to 

humble themselves. The proud will stand up for sectarianism 

and for the honors and dignities which go 

therewith, and will fail to get the divine blessing, "Blessed 

are the meek." 

(4) A true revival of religious sentiment toward 
God, and his worship in the beauty of holiness and in 
accordance with the directions of his Word, will imply 
now, as well as in Hezekiah's day, a general breaking 
up of idols. And Oh! how many idols there are which 
the Lord's people should be zealous in overthrowing. 
They are many in form and feature, but one in general 
character. One of these idols, before which thousands 
upon thousands prostrate themselves in the dust, is 
Sectarianism; another is Money; another is Lust; another, 
Selfish Ambition; another, Pride; another, Ease; 

and on the whole, they are legion, with the one family 
name, Selfishness. Whoever has come into a condition 
of full consecration to the Lord through the redemption 
that is in Christ Jesus, whoever has come to worship 
the Lord in the beauty of holiness, will readily 
realize the abominable character of these idols which 
the great Adversary has induced him, through sin, to 
bow down to and worship. And in proportion to our 
zeal for the Lord, in proportion to the measure of his 
spirit in our hearts, will we be zealous in putting down 
all these idols, and bringing not only the words of our 
mouths and the acts of life, but also our very thoughts, 



into subjection to the will of God in Christ— 2 Cor. 10:5.

TWO PRAYERS AND THEIR ANSWERS. 

-NOV. 13.-2 KINGS 19:20-22,28-37.- 

"God is our refuge and strength; a very 
present help in trouble."— Psa. 46:1. 

HEZEKIAH, king of Judah, is one of the most 
notable characters of Old Testament history, 
and our present lesson relates to him. The preceding 
lesson showed us the beginning of his reign, accompanied 
by a great religious reformation and revival amongst 
the people. The present lesson shows him under severe 
trials, and how they developed and manifested his faith 
in the Lord, and the Lord's responses to his trust and 
prayers. 

The Assyrian king, Sennacherib, had invaded the 
northern or ten-tribe kingdom, and carried its people 
captive, and had placed peoples of other nationalities 
in the land in their stead; and eight years after that 
conquest he determined upon an invasion of the kingdom 
of Judah. Already, one after the other, the Assyrians 
had conquered various nations, and were now 
evidently bent upon conquering Egypt, but first were 
disposing of the intermediate kingdoms, and Judah was 
the last of these which lay on the route between Assyria 
and Egypt. Bent upon conquest and mastery, rather 
than upon destruction, Sennacherib, while laying siege 
to some of the intermediate countries, first sent letters 
and subsequently his representative and general, Rabshakeh, 
with an armed host to Jerusalem, demanding 
the full surrender of the kingdom, that the people 
might be deported to other lands, as the people of the 
ten tribes had been. 

These letters and the message were full of boastings 
of the power of Assyria, and the conquests already 
made, and promised the people of Judah homes and 
circumstances similar to those then enjoyed, the object, 
apparently, being to establish the Assyrian empire on a 
firm basis by obliterating as far as possible the feelings 
of patriotism in the various peoples conquered. Not only 
did these messages boast of the power of Sennacherib, 
as exemplified in other wars, but taking cognizance of 
the fact that Israel trusted in Jehovah, they first declared 
that the Assyrians were sent there by Jehovah 
for the very purpose of overthrowing the kingdom, and 
taking the people captive, and secondly declared that 
their trust in Jehovah was vain, because the various 
nations which had been conquered trusted severally to 
their own gods, and yet all alike failed; and that Israel's 



God, Jehovah, could do nothing more for them than 
could the other gods for the other peoples, against the 
mighty power of Assyria, which was rapidly becoming 
a world-empire. 

Hezekiah's first move was to placate his adversary, 
by becoming his vassal, and paying annual tribute, and 
as a preliminary step in this direction he sent Sennacherib 
a present of great value, gold and silver, ivory couches, 
etc.,— even stripping the gold and silver ornaments from 
the Temple for this purpose. Herein we believe he greatly 
erred, and it would appear to have been as a consequence 
of this failure to at once recognize Jehovah as the almighty 
ruler and preserver of his people and typical 
kingdom, that the Assyrians were permitted to assail 
them, and to destroy many of the outlying smaller cities, 
and to besiege Jerusalem, the capital city, with fortresses, 
etc. Nevertheless, when it came to the extremity, 
Hezekiah's faith in the Lord increased in proportion 
as the power of the Assyrians was manifested, and 
the condition of his own city and people became the 
more critical. Then it was that he did what he should 
have done at the very beginning— he, with Isaiah, the 
prophet (his faithful friend and adviser and supposed 

R2381 : page 326 

tutor in earlier years), joined together in prayer to the 
Lord (2 Kings 19:1,2,14-19), in the Temple, laying 
before the Lord the letters received from the haughty 
Sennacherib, and recounting his boastful words, beseeching 
the Lord to have mercy upon his covenanted people, 
who now, more than for centuries, were seeking to 
please and serve him, and to grant them deliverance 
from their enemies, when there seemed no hope from 
any other quarter. 

It was in answer to this prayer that Isaiah sent to 
Hezekiah the message of our lesson: "Thus saith the 
Lord God of Israel, that which thou hast prayed to me 
against Sennacherib, king of Assyria, I have heard," etc. 
The remainder of Isaiah's message was evidently intended 
to be the answer which Hezekiah should send to 
Sennacherib, through Rabshakeh, that the people of 
Jehovah laughed to scorn his boastful message and ultimatum. 
The answer calls attention to Sennacherib's 
boastful pride and his blasphemy of the only true God, 
the God of Israel. The threat of the hook in the nose 
and the bridle in the mouth is figurative, representing 
the manner in which bullocks and horses are controlled: 
thus would the Lord control the Assyrian army. "Isaiah 
said unto him, Thus shall ye say to your master 
[Hezekiah], Thus saith the Lord, be not afraid of the 
words which thou hast heard, with which the servants 
of the king of Assyria has blasphemed me. Behold, I 
will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, 
and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him 
to fall by the sword in his own hand." (2 Kings 19:6,7.) 



The message calls attention to the success of the Assyrian 
monarch previously, and points out that it was 
because the Lord had so permitted, designed and foretold, 
but points out, also, that Sennacherib is equally 
under the divine power, and on the present occasion, 
having blasphemed Jehovah, would be unsuccessful, 
would be turned back, while his people, Israel, and 
their king Hezekiah, would be heard and succored. 

Spiritual Israelites may draw valuable lessons from 
the foregoing. We should beware how at any time we 
lose sight of the Lord's power on our behalf, no matter 
how threatening or great or dark the evil which assails 
us. A proper faith will look up to God, under such 
circumstances, and relying upon his promises will seek 
his aid, rather than seek to purchase deliverance from 
the great adversary, Satan, by any compromises. But how 
many, on the contrary, are disposed to do as Hezekiah 
did, purchase peace with things consecrated to the Lord, 
—to compromise the truth: for instance, if threatened 
with the disfavor of friends or neighbors or employers, 
how many are willing to conciliate such adversaries by 
a more worldly course, by subtracting from the time, influence, 
means, etc., consecrated to the Lord, considerable 
portions to be given to worldly service, or to secure 
domestic peace or social advancement, or commercial 
prosperity. So surely as the Lord's consecrated people 
do this, we may expect that the Lord will permit to 
come upon them the very difficulties which they dread 
and seek to avert by unholy compromise. 

They need just such a lesson; and as a faithful 
father will give needed chastisements and corrections to 
his son, so the Lord deals with those who have been 
adopted into his family. But with the world in general 
matters are different; God's special dealings and special 
corrections are the manifestations of his special care for 
those whom he is now selecting from amongst mankind 
for a great future work, for which they need to be prepared, 
and for which unlimited faith and trust in the 

R2382 : page 326 

Almighty are absolutely essential. As David expressed 
it, "Before I was afflicted I went astray:" in other 
words, it was because he went astray, and because he 
was a consecrated servant of God, therefore, instead of 
permitting him to go far astray he was corrected in 
order to bring him back. So with all who have entered 
into the New Covenant, and accepted the call to joint-heirship 
with Christ; they are not permitted to go astray 
and make compromises whose tendency would be to 
lead them further and further astray from faith and 
trust in the Lord. Therefore they are chastened, and 
happy it is for all of Spiritual Israel who, like Hezekiah, 
permit the divine chastisements to develop more 
and more of faith and obedience. 
It required great faith and courage on the part of 



Hezekiah and his princes, and the people of Judah in 
general, to resist the great power of Assyria, and to send 
to Sennacherib such a reply as the Lord had indicated, 
yet evidently their faith and trust were developed in 
proportion to the difficulty; and shortly they beheld 
the fulfilment of the Lord's declaration respecting the 
Assyrians. Rabshakeh returned to meet Sennacherib, 
and to give him Hezekiah's answer, and then, apparently 
was fulfilled the catastrophe upon Sennacherib's 
army, referred to in our lesson. 

In one place this is called "the blast of the Lord," 
from which some have supposed that it was a simoon, 
or sandstorm, not uncommon in the vicinity of the 
Arabian desert. In the lesson it is spoken of as the 
smiting of the angel of the Lord, and others have assumed 
from this that it was a pestilence which broke out 
in Sennacherib's army and destroyed in one night one 
hundred and eighty-five thousand of his warriors; because 
elsewhere pestilence is spoken of as being the work 
of a destroying angel or messenger. (See 2 Sam. 24:16,17.) 
Jewish tradition ascribes the destruction to a 
pestilence. The word "angel" here, as often elsewhere 
in the Scriptures, does not necessarily refer to a member 
of the angelic order of beings, but simply signifies 
"messenger;" and God is as able to use winds or waves, 

R2382 : page 327 

lightnings or sandstorms, or pestilence, as any other 
agency in the execution of his will. "Who maketh the 
winds his angels, and flaming fire his servants."— 
Psa. 104:4. 

Egyptian history contains an account of the remarkable 
departure of Sennacherib's army, and ascribes 
its retreat to an invasion of field mice, which gnawed 
the quivers and bowstrings and the thongs by which 
their shields were managed. But some have suggested 
that this is the Egyptian figurative way of speaking of a 
pestilence, because with them the mouse was a symbol 
representing pestilence. There are many other notable 
instances in history in which, apparently, divine providence 
has similarly intervened and protected those whom 
it was not the divine will should be further injured. 
For instance, the notable case of the Spanish Armada, 
designed to work great havoc upon the people of Great 
Britain, and apparently well qualified to do the work, 
was destroyed by a remarkable storm. Similarly, Napoleon's 
army, which had invaded Russia, and was encamped 
at Moscow, was, it is said, forced to retreat because 
of a heavy fall of snow, which is said to have 
caused the death of 20,000 of Napoleon's horses, and 
compelled the retreat which involved the almost complete 
destruction of his army, numbering over a quarter 
of a million. In the churches of Moscow the narrative 
of the destruction of Sennacherib's army is read on the 
anniversary of the retreat of the French from their city, 



as marking a similar interposition of divine providence. 

As the Israelites accepted the overthrow and turning 
back of Sennacherib's forces as of divine interposition, 
altho the sceptically inclined might view it differently, 
and ascribe it to natural causes, so Spiritual Israelites 
often find that God's answers to their prayers, and fulfilments 
of his promises are of such a kind that the 
trustful may see in them the hand of God, while those 
living less near to the Almighty will see in them nothing 
but the casualties of nature. Thus it is that our own 
spiritual condition has much to do with our joy in the 
Lord, and our appreciation of his care over us, and of 
the fulfilment of his promises. All of the divine leadings 
are along this line, namely, "According to thy 
faith be it unto thee." He who will not exercise faith 
in God cannot have the joy and peace which come to 
and are intended for believers only. It is the proper 
thing that as the Lord's people we should not only trust 
him for his goodness and providential care, and call to 
mind his promises, and plead them before him in our 
supplications, but it is also equally proper that we 
should seek to see at every step of life's journey how 
divine providence is directing our way, and causing all 
of life's affairs to work together for good to those who 
love God. Such expectations of divine care, and such 
waiting for it and looking for it, are evidences of true 
faith, and pleasing to the Lord. Accordingly, he assures 
us that without faith it is impossible to please him and 
again he assures us, "This is the victory that overcometh 
the world, even your faith." 

In those days wars were not accomplished so quickly 
as at the present time, and the Israelites might well 
have been fearful that the retreat of Sennacherib's army 
was only temporary, and that he would come upon 
them again, and hence the Lord gave them a sign; viz., 
that altho they had been hindered from planting their 
crops that year they should have a sufficiency of food 
from that which would spring up of itself, and likewise 
the year following. The sign was fulfilled, and the people 
understood that they were effectually delivered: and 
altho Sennacherib lived for some twenty years after his 
retreat, he did not again attempt to conquer the land of 
Judah, and subsequently was assassinated by his own 
sons, as was set forth in the Lord's prophecy.— 
Verse 7. 

Assyrian history records, on tablets and cylinders 
of baked clay (the books of those days), Sennacherib's 
many victories, but they make no mention of this disaster 
which the Lord brought upon him, just as upon 
Napoleon's tomb in Paris are inscribed the various 
battles of his wars, but Waterloo is omitted. The first 
features of Sennacherib's victory over Judah are described 
in these words, on what is known as the "Taylor 
cylinder," now in the British Museum: "Because Hezekiah, 
king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke I 
came up against him, and by force of arms, and by the 



might of my power, I took forty-six of his strong fenced 
cities; and of the smaller towns, which were scattered 
about, with the march of a host and surrounding of a 
multitude, with attack of ranks, and force of battering-rams, 
and mines and missiles, I besieged and captured 
a countless number. From these places I took and 
carried off 200,150 persons, old and young, male and 
female, together with horses and mules, asses and goats, 
sheep and oxen, a countless multitude, and Hezekiah 
himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a 
bird in a cage, building towers round the city, to hem 
him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so 
as to prevent his escape. ...Then upon this Hezekiah 
there fell the fear of the might of my arms, and he sent out 
to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem, with thirty 
talents of gold, and eight hundred talents of silver, 
precious stones, of large size, couches of ivory... 
woods of every kind— an abundant treasure... all 
these were brought to me at Nineveh, the city of my 
dominion, Hezekiah having sent them by way of tribute, 
as a token of submission to my power." Thus Sennacherib 
boasts of Hezekiah's mistake, but wholly omits 
Hezekiah's subsequent victory, through prayer and the 
manifestation of divine power. 

R2382 : page 328 

ANOTHER DEFEAT AND ANOTHER VICTORY. 

In consequence of this marked deliverance of Judah 
from the superior power of Assyria, we read, "And 
many brought gifts unto the Lord at Jerusalem, and 
presents to Hezekiah, King of Judah; so that he was 
magnified in the sight of all nations from henceforth. 
...And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and 
honor, and he made himself treasuries for silver and 
gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and shields, 
and for all manner of desirable instruments," etc. 
(2 Chron. 32:22,27,30.) But prosperity is often a 
severer test of character than adversity, and hence we 
read, "But Hezekiah rendered not again, according to 
the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up. 
Therefore there was wrath upon him and upon Judah 
and Jerusalem. Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled 
himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants 
in Judah, so that the wrath of the Lord came 
not upon them in the days of Hezekiah."— 
2 Chron. 32:25,26. 

"In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death." It 
was somewhere in this period of time, we may not be 
certain exactly when, but evidently the sickness had 
somewhat to do with Hezekiah's prosperity and consequent 
pride; but his sickness, in the midst of various 
great projects for the advancement of his country, and 
the welfare of his people, was a sore disappointment to 
Hezekiah, and led him to the Lord in prayer. Doubtless 



he realized from the nature of the message delivered 

to him by Isaiah, that his sickness and premature 

death were penalties for his failure to render unto the 

Lord according to the multitude of his blessings. And 

so realizing, the king prayed most earnestly for forgiveness 

and help, promising that henceforth "I shall go 

softly all my years. ...We will sing my songs to the 

stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house 

of the Lord." Isa. 38:9-22 records, in poetic form, 

Hezekiah's resolves, and is evidently the embodiment 

of his previous prayer, with thanksgiving for his deliverance: 

for the Lord was gracious to him, accepted his prayer, 

covered his sins, and healed him. The prophet 

R2383 : page 328 

was sent back to him with the message of his recovery. 

The king, anxious to assure himself that he was 
indeed the subject of a divine miracle, requested a proof 
of the increase of his life fifteen years. Isaiah proposed 
that the proof should be that the sun's record on 
the sun-dial should be suddenly advanced ten degrees, 
but Hezekiah thought it would be a still greater miracle 
if it should be turned back ten degrees, and his request 
was granted. The possibility of such a miracle has 
been questioned by many, who have insisted that it 
could in no way be possible, that it would involve not 
only stoppage of the motion of the earth upon its axis, 
but an impossible retrograde movement, to be accomplished 
in a moment of time. However, Professor 
Garbett, writing for a magazine called Knowledge, declares 
that he knew of an afternoon some years ago 
when, on many sundials in Southern England, there occurred 
exactly the wonder described in the book of Kings. 

Asked by Astronomer R. A. Proctor to describe 
it, he writes as follows:— "The shiftings of the shadows 
on the dial, that Isaiah predicted to sick Hezekiah, are 
liable to occur at any place, when these two circumstances 
occur: (1) That the upper atmosphere 
is in that condition which causes two bright parhelion 
or mock suns to appear on opposite sides of the sun; 
and (2) that the lower air contains drifting clouds, 
massive enough to hide often two of the three [apparent 
suns]. When the real sun and eastern mock sun 
are hidden, there is only the western [mock sun] to 
cast shadows, which then coincide with what the sun 
would cast an hour and a half later; but if the cloud 
shift so as to hide the west parhelion, and disclose 
the eastern, the shadows instantly become such as the 
sun cast an hour and a half earlier.... On March 
29, 1858, these effects occurred, had any one been looking, 
on every dial of Portsea, and very probably of much 
of Hampshire besides. The parhelia were present and 
bright enough at about 1 1 A.M. and still better at 1 P.M." 

But the fact that Joshua's long day can be accounted 
for by the reflected light of the sun in clouds of a peculiar 



kind, and the fact that the turning back of the 
shadow for Hezekiah can be accounted for somewhat 
similarly, as above, by no means lessens either of these 
as miracles; because they were not accidental, but 
specially given as proofs of divine power. The fact 
that we may learn how the divine power acted in the 
fulfilment of the divine prediction subtracts nothing 
from the miracle, just as in the case of Hezekiah's recovery 
the fact that a fig poultice was applied, and that 
God thus made use of a means to an end, detracted 
nothing from the miraculousness of his recovery. As 
children of God, this is an important lesson for us to 
have deeply engraven upon our memories: God still uses 
natural means for the accomplishment of the exceeding 
great and precious promises of a spiritual kind, which 
he has bestowed upon us. Has he not promised us 
grace to help in every time of need? It is not necessary 
that we should suppose that this grace will come to us 
without a channel; it probably will come through a 
human channel. Has God promised to us meat in due 
season to the household of faith? It is reasonable for 
us to expect that it will come to us, as his other mercies 
and blessings have come, from his Word, and through 
the helpfulness of the fellow-members of the body of 
Christ, whom the Lord will make use of in serving the 
meat to the household of faith. --Matt. 24:45. 

Hezekiah's experiences in respect to the Lord's remarkable 
answers to his two prayers seem to have 
wrought in him a commendable faith and trust, so that 
subsequently, when servants of the king of Babylon 
visited him with a present, and to congratulate him 
upon his recovery from sickness, and to view the wonderful 
aqueducts and evidences of engineering skill 
which he had accomplished, and when Hezekiah unwisely 
had shown these foreigners the great wealth of 
his treasuries, etc., and Isaiah was sent to reprove him 
for this, and to tell him that the king of Babylon would 
ultimately come and despoil the city of its treasures, 
etc., but not in Hezekiah's day, he said, with prompt 
resignation to the divine will, "Good is the word of the 
Lord, which thou hast spoken." He said, moreover, 
"For there shall be peace and truth in my day."— 
Isa. 39:3,8. 

Similarly all who are learning to trust the Lord, or 
who have tasted that he is gracious, should more and 
more be coming to this attitude of heart and mind: to 
a recognition of the fact that all God's ways are perfect, 
so that they can say, "Tho he slay me yet will I 
trust him." "I will rejoice in the God of my salvation."
