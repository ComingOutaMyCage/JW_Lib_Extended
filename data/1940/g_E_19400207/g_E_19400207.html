<p><span class="font14">Big Business Bemoans the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">V | W BIG BUSINESS, and particularly V big business in America, will profit tjfl'.W ^<sup>rom</sup> ^e war, intends to profit from the war now raging in Europe; but Mtlto do so discreetly. Hence, first of all, the positive and unequivocal statement by Big Business that it does not want war, does not like war, and will not under any circumstances seek to profit from war. Of course not! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Say the McGraw-Hill industrial and business publications, reaching over a million readers: “To say that Industry and Business want war or will encourage, directly or indirectly, our participation in the present war, is a vicious and deliberate lie.” All right, then, here it is: Industry and Business want war and will encourage, directly and indirectly, America’s participation in war just as soon as it thinks it can profit by that course of action!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next comes the “Neutrality” legislation, which must make it possible for business to profit from the war to the fullest extent, but at the least possible risk. Hence America will sell all the arms possible to the belligerents. When the bill was passed wdiieh made this possible there was tremendous trading on the stock market and stocks rose remarkably. This was an indication of the sorrow of Big Busi- , ness over the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eugene G. Grace, munitions maker No. 1 of the United States, and head of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, says he is against war from every aspect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One industry which stands to profit materially from war is the chemical industry. Charles Belknap, executive vice president of the Monsanto Chemical Co. of St. Louis, said, “We don’t want a war—we^can’t afford one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, then, there are a lot of other things “we” can’t afford. For instance, it is rather expensive to keep on feeding millions of mouths at public expense, and making parks and public improvements right and left out of an empty treasury. It may be possible to figure out a way to balance the public ledger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Past experience suggests that wars have served the purposes of Big Business rather than the interests of the people, and even where such public interests seem to have been in a measure safeguarded by recourse to arms Big Business has generally managed to insert its right front foot at the propitious moment and come away with a not inconsiderable profit. Can you blame the people for being a little suspicious and uneasy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newspaper correspondents, at any rate, do not altogether rule out the probability of America’s doing something, in case ... In weighing the possibilities of failure or success, defeat or victory, in the present European war, Eugene Staley, in the Neiv York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font7">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An element which throws all calculations into doubt, however, is the policy of the Soviet Union. [Clarified by his a la </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font7"> invasion of Finland, and shameless lying incident thereto.—-Ed.] Stalin would seem to be in a position where, by withholding supplies, he could insure Hitler’s ultimate defeat, or, by giving or lending to Hitler, or perhaps even by trading vigorously, he could threaten to prolong the war intolerably for the Allies. All this, of course, omits many imponderables : uprisings, strokes of military genius, or what Americans might decide to do as events shaped themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So, however much Big Business does not want to have war, it may change its attitude very quickly. Just now it seems not willing to admit that it can see that anything could be gained by resorting to war—and that, of course, is the main consideration: gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Taking Sorrow by the Forelock</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Said H. Gordon Selfridge, of London, “The opportunity to achieve and to show results has been eliminated all over the world. The world in the future will perhaps be better for the underdog, but for the man who takes risks and engages in enterprise there will be little incentive.” Too bad 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., chairman of General Motors Corp., said that in case of war, “irrespective of all the facts and circumstances, all ultimately lose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The automobile industry, as represented by the Automobile Manufacturers Association, has not done so badly during the past fiscal year. The wholesale value of cars and trucks produced (United States and Canada) was $2,224,475,000; and that of tires, parts and accessories for replacement and service, $1,243,236,000; a tidy total, of $3,467,711,000. It would seem, then, that Big Business in this field would not be particularly interested in war, unless, of course, it should help to solve problems of strikes, lockouts and unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The General Electric Company showed a net profit of $25,022,631 for the first nine months of the year 1939, an increase of 43 percent over the same period of the preceding year. The figures suggest a neat profit, although they do not, to the public, disclose the percentage of gain on the capital stock. Comparison of export trade figures with the World War nations for the two and a half years before and after the war started is significant. The total for that period before the war was $4,094,728,000. The first' two and a half years of war saw the total rise to $7,662,573,000, an increase which made it possible for American workers to wear silk shirts and otherwise 'put on the dog’. Of course, that couldn’t last, and didn’t. It is merely mentioned in passing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wars must be paid for, and England’s income tax rate has accordingly been drastically increased. Note the comparison between the United States and England:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">And this is as good a point as any. to mention that the so-called &quot;Holy See” also does not like war, because it interferes with revenue. A special press dispatch dealing with this sad fact mentions that during the first three months of war these revenues were reduced by more than forty percent. .The dispatch is amusing in that it is introduced with a paragraph which mentions how the war has caused Pope Pius XII deep anguish because of the human suffering and the millions who are deprived of religious solace. It also remarks that Vatican quarters, 'preoccupied with the humanitarian and spiritual problems created by Hitler’s war,’ do not care to indicate how seriously “Church” revenues have been curtailed. Suppose the pope and his familiars will have to go without new dresses and a few other luxuries for the time being. One can never tell. Anyway, the item is headed “Catholic Church Hard Hit by War and Dictators. Worship Is Made Difficult and Cash Gifts Are Curtailed”. In Italy and Germany the item doubtless reads a bit differently, substituting, say, “Democracies” for “Dictators”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Advertising the Religious Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The religious business is being widely advertised by one of the Hearst outfits, i.e., by King Features Syndicate, Inc., which he controls. The advertisements are by James Arnold, and quite attractive in appearance. They occupied full pages in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Morning Herald,</span><span class="font7"> Gloversville and Johnstown, N. Y.; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Highland Park News Herald,</span><span class="font7"> Los Angeles, Calif.; the Columbus (Ohio) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch;</span><span class="font7"> the Milwaukee (Wis.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel;</span><span class="font7"> the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and American; The HeraldAdvertiser,</span><span class="font7"> Hunting ton, W.Va., and wherever else they could be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Gloversville the advertisements were paid for by the Protestant and Catholic churches and the Jewish community center; the Milwaukee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel</span><span class="font7"> contributed the space; the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Journal and American</span><span class="font7"> and others did not say who footed the bill; the Huntington advertisements were “sponsored by the Huntington Brotherhood Conference * of Christians and Jews”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first advertisement shows a Protestant church, or, at least, if it is a Catholic church the cross is turned sidewise. The Jews and Catholics must have been oh so pleased to help pay for showing off that church. The theme is, “May God keep us tolerant,” as in some</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation </span><span class="font7">thousands of places where Jehovah’s witnesses have been jailed and abused in the United States, not to mention Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The second advertisement shows the Puritans landing on New England shores. They are skillfully dressed to look like monks and nuns, and the average American sucker will think that they are. The Catholics and Jews must have been delighted to pay for that advertisement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The third advertisement is of a boy asking his mother, “Who is the unknown soldier?” That is to glorify war, wholesale murder. And, no joking, all the Protestants, Catholics and Jews ought to have been delighted to pay for that advertisement, for without their aid and co-operation there would be no war.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400207_files/g_E_19400207-2.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:253pt;">
<p><span class="font7">Another grand ride to prosperity</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The fourth advertisement represents Jesus telling the boys and girls to love one another, so that when they grow up they can murder one another in another world war, and either imprison Jehovah’s witnesses for telling the truth about war, “purgatory,” hell and other theological nonsense, or else burn them at the stake. Hearst has done another fool job very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Big Business Is for Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Big Business is for more religion. The New York State Chamber of Commerce (not connected in any way with the New York Stock Exchange) issued a confession that—■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In these workaday, warring, striving times, we have been paying less and less attention to our religious convictions and feeling. If this nation does not maintain its religions foundation, its whole structure- will fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now there-was Richard Whitney, late president of the New York Stock Exchange, and public lecturer on honesty. When he stole about $2,000,000 his conviction was what might be, called a religious conviction. Also, it caused much feeling that one so religious should be “sent up the river”. So there we have both the religious conviction and the feeling; but has it changed the religious foundation of the New York Chamber of Commerce? Not a whit. So somebody must be all wet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whitney’s theft of $110,000 of bonds of the New York Yacht Club caused the closing of its Pier No. 2 and the discharge of faithful employees who had worked there for a lifetime. The manager had a nervous breakdown and died. The secretary of the Club, who had the job of firing his old friends, suffered a stroke of paralysis and is at death’s door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After Whitney stole two million dollars from his customers, the Exchange purified itself by making Robert. M. Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, one of its board of governors. Hutchins has just resigned because the rest of the governors did not have nerve enough to go after the House of Morgan because of their guilty knowledge of what Whitney was doing at the time he was giving his inspiring lessons on honesty to American youths, and helping himself freely to money that did not belong to him. Hutchins thinks that even the House of Morgan could be investigated to good public advantage, but his comrades on the board of governors just could not go that far; so he quit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">History of a Great Businessman</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Philip Musiea, son of an Italian immigrant barber, was imprisoned for customs fraud in 1909; arrested for defrauding banks of $1,000,000 in 1912; arrested on a perjury charge in a murder ease in 1920; called himself Dr. Coster and went in for the manufae-ture on a huge scale of bootleg liquor called “hair tonic<sup>7</sup>’, in 1922; made a huge pile of money and bought the presidency of McKesson &amp;&nbsp;Robbins in 1925; renamed his two brothers George Dietrich and George Vernard and made them assistant treasurer and fiscal agent of the corporation which the three of them then trimmed to the tune of $18,000,000. Meanwhile Musica became director of the Bridgeport Trust Company and of the Fairfield Trust Company, had a 140-foot yacht and an elegant country house.' Then got caught and committed suicide. Where else but in America could a poor boy get away with such a program ? Still, there is Hitler.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Besides the large-scale illegal liquor operations for which he was adopted by the Wall Street crowd as worthy of their trust, he was reputedly engaged in gang murders and gun running and was therefore well worthy a place in the bright galaxy in which Whitney moved at the time he was president of the New York Stock Exchange and its chief lecturer on honesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The leaders in the list of certified public accountants in the United States, Price, Waterhouse &amp;&nbsp;Company, distinguished themselves by certifying the accounts of McKesson &amp;&nbsp;Robbins from 1935 to 1939. During all those years F. Donald Coster-Philip Musica managed to cover up the fact that he had stolen $18,000,000 from the McKesson &amp;&nbsp;Robbins Company, and he put over such a fine line of fictitious inventories, fictitious accounts receivable from fictitious foreign concerns, and fictitious profits, that Price, Waterhouse &amp;&nbsp;Company gave their official O.K. and certified that everything was all right.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A boy eight years of age that did not know it is impossible to ship drugs from Canada to Pretoria, South Africa, by truck, would hardly be worth bringing up. Yet the $1,000,000 auditing that Price, Waterhouse &amp;&nbsp;Company gave in the McKesson &amp;&nbsp;Robbins ease was not sufficient to catch an item of this kind. The same auditing institution also approved shipments to Scotland and England and other overseas countries by truck. The joke of it is that Price, Waterhouse &amp;&nbsp;Company are supposed to be the very topnotchers in the auditing business. This makes it look as if, in New York, the only qualification needed fo become a successful auditor is the ability and the nerve to charge the biggest kind of prices. Richard Whitney should be let out of prison and put in charge of the advertising booth of Price, Waterhouse &amp;&nbsp;Company at the World’s Fair next summer. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Testimony adduced in Waterbury, Connecticut, seems to show that if you want expert auditing done and you cannot get Price, Waterhouse &amp;&nbsp;Company you might try the accounting firm of George H. Kingsley, Ine. To be sure, the mayor of Waterbury, T. Frank Hayes, and the twenty-two others accused in the $1,000,000 graft conspiracy indictments, got only about five percent as much graft as the Musica brothers who wrecked McKesson &amp;&nbsp;Robbins; but is it not some achievement to audit the accounts of a gang that can dust a city treasury for $1,000,000, and give them a clean bill of health? And should not something be done to give glory to a civic administration that can bum the Contents of ninety-nine official filing cases?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Giants in the Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were giants in the earth before the Deluge, and there arc giants now, before Armageddon. In 1919, in the United States there .were but 6 companies in the billiondollar class and their total assets were less than $10,000,000,000. Now there are 28 in the same class, and in 1937 their assets were $47,228,527,082. In fifty years, i.e., in 1987, with the assets doubling every 12½ years, the sum total in the hands of the billionaires would be $755,656,433,312, or about double the value of all the property in the world. Anybody who can figure interest must see that Armageddon would have to come soon, to put an end to such an evil system. The eight interest groups controlling most of the essential industries are among the modern giants, American category.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The industrial and bank assets of the eight interest groups are set at $61,025,000,000. Through their 83 directors these groups control 96 percent of the assets of all railroads, 75 percent of all public utilities, 48 percent of all commercial banks, and 34 percent of all manufacturing corporations in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How many of the present-day giants got their start is indicated in an article by Oscar Ameringer, in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The American Guardian.</span><span class="font7"> He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Landhogs in and out of government grabbed the fertile river valleys and tidewater plains east of the Appalachian mountains and reared lordly estates on the backs of slaves, both white and black. Land sharks with the aid of pliant politicians bought</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tracts of virgin land the size of Old World principalities for a few pennies and sold it to land-hungry peasants for all that the traffic would bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Later, timber wolves in man’s clothing devoured millions of square miles of virgin timber, leaving nothing but blackened stumps, burned-off top soil, and deserted lumber camps behind. Still later came railroad buccaneers, grabbing, with the consent of America’s public servants (God save the mark), stretches of territory the size of Old World empires. With the surface Went the sub-surface mineral wealth the Creator had stored in the course of millions of years for all. And finally came the captains of industry, commerce and banking, building their empires on patents, franchises, brute force, mere bigness, monopoly, the power to make and unmake statesmen, crowned by the imperial might to make or unmake, grant or withhold money, the lifeblood of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until by now virtually every avenue and means which 130 million Americans must use in their struggle for life, liberty and happiness are in the possession of a few hundred corporations manipulated by a half dozen banking rings, robbing their laborers, customers and stockholders with evenhanded impartiality. Oue America is shell; the kernel belongs to others and the others are a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Benevolent Standard Oil</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">/One of the kernel owners is John D. Rockefeller, Jr., of Standard Oil fame. Unintentionally explaining why so few men control America, and why, in the richest land in the world, there are more unemployed people than in most of the remainder of the civilized world, John made the statement that “this country was founded on religion”. John could not say this country was founded on Christianity. The untruth of such a remark would have been too palpably self-evident.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400207_files/g_E_19400207-4.png" alt="" style="width:41pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The benevolences of the Standard Oil crowd are matters of history. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font7"> tells of that happy day when Christy Payne, one of its vice presidents and directors (Standard Oil Company of New Jersey), handed over $350,000 in cash in a sealed envelope, which envelope, still sealed, went to the then editor of the Denver </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font7"> to buy that newspaper’s support for a city gas ordinance sanctioning the 40c gas rate now in effect in Denver, and which the Denver people find extortionate. The paper suddenly switched from opposition to the ordinance to its support and “Standard” probably felt that it had made a good investment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Standard Oil showed its touching patriotism when it placed six of its tankers under</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 7, 1940 </span><span class="font7">the Panama flag and fired the American sailors who had previously made a living on them. In pursuing this typically Standard Oil move, Big Business shows its enthusiasm for participating in the war profits sniffed from afar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Chance for Profits</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Big Business, always on the lookout for profits, smacks its lips when it thinks of cash business for Britain and France, carried in British and French vessels, and cash business for Italy, carried in Italian vessels. Italy accomplishes more for Germany by acting as her shipping agent than by entering the war direct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The deadliest of all bombs, used in Barcelona to kill people an eighth of a mile away and to stun them a quarter of a mile away, are claimed to be the invention of two Americans, whose parents should be sorry they ever came into the world. The contents of the killers are liquid air, synthetic wool and a small quantity of oil, and the accursed things can be made even in an automobile truck. They are fine for making plenty of corpses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Corpses are treated with formaldehyde to keep them nice and fresh; and now Big Business has found a new use for this valuable chemical. Patent No. 2,159,743, awarded to two Wilmington men, has 'been assigned to the E. I. du Pont de Nemours. Company, of that city. It is stated that cellulose sheets, treated with formaldehyde, will keep bread fresh almost indefinitely, the same as it does milk and corpses and other things that are treated with it. It sounds a little bit disturbing to those, if any, who wish to stay alive, but it is wonderful for the corpses, funeral directors and large shippers of milk, and for these Wilmington patriots that made such hundreds of millions of dollars during the World War that they hardly know what to do with all their money. You know yourself that they don’t want to pay taxes on their incomes; so let them buy patents. The only thing is that when you get to eating formaldehyde-treated bread, your body will stay nice and fresh, but you will be out of luck; for “the dead know not any thing”. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) But that is something Big Business doesn’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Use for Proprionic Acid-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The inventions and discoveries of big business are not primarily concerned with the welfare of the people. There are, for instance,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font7">the bakers that discovered how plaster of Paris could be incorporated into bread, not mentioning any names. Then there is the Ward Baking Company, of New York, which is now the owner of patent No. 2,154,449, by which propionic acid and its salts can be mixed into the dough and no mold will form. In this way humans can eat bread, cereals, cakes and other edibles that are ten days old and will have no way of knowing they are unfit to eat, because they will show no mold. Maybe, after a little, by adding a few more chemicals to the plaster of Paris and the propionic acid salts, the Ward company can avoid putting in any milk or flour or other eatable materials, and then when the eater does eat their product he will have something that will stay with him for life. Won’t that be nice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are you fond of candy? Some people are. If you are you will be in<sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terested to learn that seven of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">big candy manufacturers were hauled up for putting on the market huge quantities of candies infested with rodent hairs, sticks, splinters, bits of paper, excreta, lead, and sulphur-diox ide, besides lots of ordinary dirt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Forty thousand ladies that wanted to anoint their lips and ruin their looks by painting them with concoctions containing cadmium and selenium will be deprived of that opportunity. Uncle Sam doesn’t want American girls poisoned; so he held up a shipment from Gierlain, Ine., of Paris, which contained these allegedly deleterious substances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Big Business doesn’t mind telling a fib when it is convenient. But now Lord and Taylor will stop advertising their cosmetics as “nourishing”. Mary Dunhill may no longer say her lotions correct acne or that her products come from Paris. Richard Hudnut will stop claiming that their products prevent or eliminate wrinkles or feed the skin. Varady, Inc., will no longer claim that their stuff will cure dry skin or keep it young. The Federal Trade Commission has been after them, and now they will be good, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The life of radio tubes for new radio sets obtainable on the market is 1,000 hours, but since the year 1923 the telephone companies have constantly used a tube which uses less power and lasts 50,000 hours. Why can’t you get these tubes, then? Simply because fifty profits are more attractive to Big Business than one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Heaping Up Treasure</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Heaping up treasure for the last days continues to be the occupation of some of the executives of concerns famous for the small wages paid employees. Thus, C. W. Deyo, and nine other figureheads of the Woolworth Company, not only received huge salaries, but awarded themselves a total of $574,551 in bonuses besides. In the “recession” of 1938 the General Motors Corporation cheerfully laid off thousands of low-paid workers, but paid William S. Knudsen, president, and thirteen other high officials, splendid salaries and $625,825 in bonuses. Betcha Deyo and Knudsen are among the most patriotic flag-salooters in the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A new invention will result in a better price for old papers, in due time. Tens of thousands of acres of woodlands have been stripped to furnish wood-pulp newsprint at $50 to $55 per ton. Old papers, magazines, poster sheets and even carbon paper can now be cleaned of dirt and ink, made white and rolled again into nice, new, clean newsprint (paper at $30 to $35 per ton, with a reasonable profit to the manufacturers. This is bound to result in a greater demand for old papers, with a resultant better price. The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Gazette</span><span class="font7"> was the first newspaper to use the made-over paper, and declared it a great success.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ It was bad enough for the cobblers when the 5-and-10-eent stores began selling composition soles and a tube of glue for 10c, and everybody could put on new soles over their worn-out old ones, and the new ones would last a year. But now a German inventor has invented a fixative containing grains of bitumen, calcium carbonate, sand and resin, and when this is applied to the soles they outlast the uppers of the shoes. Seems like a bad outlook for the cobblers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Some of the lukewarm ones have fallen by the way, fearful lest the enemy do them hurt. But the Lord has raised up many others and given them unbounded zeal and courage. It is especially interesting to note the great numbers of very young folks that are coming to the Kingdom organization. Many of these were in evidence at the Goudeau campaign lately.

<p><span class="font7">♦ A scientific study of the effects of pain shows that a tight clamping of the arm dulls a pain in the forehead, and that biting the lips does really reduce pain in other parts of the body. Also, an injection of alcohol reduces pain 40 percent, while aspirin reduces it but 35 percent, and six aspirin tablets arc no more effective than one.

<p><span class="font7">Any rusted metal may be soaked in it, or the kerosene may be poured over the surface and left there an hour or so. Nickel piping in the bathroom, which sometimes turns a dull-green color that resists applications of soap and water and scouring powders, should be well soaked in kerosene. A cloth dipped in kerosene may be *w on nd around the pipe and left there for some time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Tissue paper makes an excellent polish for window glass and mirrors. Wash, dry, and then polish with the paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When windows are hard to raise, pour a little hot lard 'between the window frame and the easing; also.on the pulleys and ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paint the window screen on the inside with thin white paint; then persons who are inside the house can see out, but passers-by cannot see within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Powdered borax sprinkled around window sills and thresholds will keep ants out of the house.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The housewife who does her own work and is obliged to use strong soap will keep her hands in good condition by washing them in salt water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salt is good for the complexion. Twice a week at least, rinse the face with a salt-water solution—a basin of cold water in which a tablespoonful of salt has been added. Sea bath</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font7">is not within everyone’s reach. The next best </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">thing </span><span class="font7">is a salt-water bath. To a gallon of water add a pint of salt and apply to the body with a towel. Do not wash off, but rub dry with a coarse towel. This is a good tonic-in case of depression, loss of appetite and sleeplessness. Salt rubbed into wounds, if you can stand! it, is very healing, but m,ay leave a scar. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. A </span><span class="font7">little salt on the fingers<sup>1</sup> when cleaning fowls or meat will prevent slipping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salt also makes a good cleanser for the teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the best things to cleanse the scalp thoroughly is to dissolve one-ha If teaspoonful of borax in a quart of water, and apply it, rubbing it in well. Rinse well in clear water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A vinegar rinse makes the hair soft and silky because it removes soap scum. It should not be left in the hair, but flooded away with clear water. Lemon juice is also good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ringworms will yield to borax treatment. Apply a strong solution of borax three times a day; also dust on the fine, dry powder often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To remove ink stains from the fingers moisten them with warm water, then rub the sulphur end of a match well over the stains, and the ink will disappear.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Color in the Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tflere is the best of reasons why a home should have beauty as well as utility, be attractive as well as useful. This does not necessarily involve the expenditure of an excessive amount of time or money. A little forethought will serve to make surroundings harmonious and pleasing to the eye. It has been found that white, ivory and green have been best sellers in stoves. Coral and lilac are popular colors in toilet sets. In plumbing and sanitary fixtures ivory, pink and jade-green are favorite colors. For interior paints cream, ivory and green are most frequently chosen. Blue, gray and green are restful colors, while yellow, orange and red are cheering. Strong colors should be used sparingly. Rooms with little sun should let cheerful colors ■ predominate, while rooms with plenty of sun may more safely be finished in the cooler hues. Red should be used only as a trim, never in large areas. Large patterns on draperies, furniture and walls are a weariness to the flesh. Choose restful, quiet, unobtrusive designs, if any, and avoid vivid contrasts. Simplicity and harmony make for beauty. -</span></p>

The mother, being a Catholic, opposed his having another of those books, but finally' we prevailed and he got the book. He then told his companion, “I’ll let you read it.” “We will read it together.” “You will like it.” Two weeks later I called and he had half of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> read.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Action Against Prague, Oklahoma</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">♦ Chandler, Aug. 17.— (Special.)—Four damage suits totaling $8,190 have been filed in Lincoln County district court here as the aftermath of a near riot at Prague a month ago when members of the Jehovah’s witnesses sect attempted to spread literature and propaganda of an antireligious nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mrs. Laura Miller, court clerk, said the suits named as defendants the city of Prague, three Prague ministers, three police officers, a member of the city council and another Prague resident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The suits were filed by Mrs. Margaret Meredith of Shawnee, Mrs. Sallie Johnson of Oklahoma City, Charles Sanders of Oklahoma City and W. B. Taylor of near Norman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The petitions accused the defendants of inciting a crowd of Prague residents into an angry mob who “cursed at, abused, misused, grossly insulted and jostled about in an angry and insolent manner” the plaintiffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The four plaintiffs were members of the group of Jehovah’s witnesses who staged a parade in Prague July 15 carrying banners and placards reading “Religion Is a Snare and a Racket”, “Fascism or Freedom” and similar signs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several minor fights broke out and a near riot resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The defendants in the suits in addition to the city of Prague are Rev. Roscoe F. Ferguson, pastor of the Methodist church; Rev. A. T. Hill, pastor of the Methodist Protestant church; Rev. W. P. Weeks, former pastor of the Baptist church; Ellis Gray, police chief; Johnson Hignite, police deputy; Charles Underwood, acting police chief at the time of the attempted parade; P. M.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A Good Picture of Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Have you ever visited a “movie” lot ? Within an area comprising about five to ten acres are congregated structures representing various sections of the world and nearly every period of civilization. Before you there may be ,a stately French villa built to scale, and landscaped to conform with those common to the Riviera. Less than two hundred feet away there is a drab, squatty, clapboard building of the general store type of the California gold rush days. The dusty road before it and the sun-bleached sign designating the proprietor are in contrast to the elegance of the villa. On farther one is confronted by a little bit of the middle ages—a quaint old English village. Within a stone’s throw of this peaceful scene he is amazed to see in an open field a modern wharf and a replica of an ocean liner with all the atmosphere of one of the world’s largest seaports. The fronts of these structures are so realistic, even to the most minute detail, that onij is compelled to admire them. One accepts them for what they appear to be. When one investigates a little further, when he ventures to peer behind the front, what disillusionment awaits him! The villa, ocean liner, English village, and general store are a maze of props, braces, boards, and studs. They lack everything the imagination had engendered about them. From then on one accepts the “sets” for what they are—just false fronts, shams, something merely intended to deceive one visually. This is a good picture of religion; a sham, fraud and hypocrisy from beginning to end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">How I Obtained the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ I </span><span class="font7">used to get all the Watchtower literature at my door, but never opened the books to see what was inside, until one day in March of last year. We were gathering a lot of articles to sell at our rummage sale, when someone sent us a set of your books. There were six of them, all together with a band around them. One of the ladies said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Oh, those books! Our minister said to destroy them all, as they belong to the Devil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With that she opened the door of the stove and cast them all into the flames, saying, “These will never get into anyone’s hands if we can help it.” I began to cry, thinking she had destroyed something precious. When I went home that night I searched out the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font7"> and since that time I have most of the books and also get </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch tower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font7"> Most of all, I read them and understand the good work you are doing, and that all you say about the clergy and their religion is the truth. You certainly do not find Christianity in the church today. Now that my eyes are open, I thank God for it and hope you can keep up the good work, until some other blind fools are awakened before it is too late. —Mrs. J. Whinniers, Manitoba.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Extermination of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Referring to the practical extermination of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, a German refugee is reported in the Pueblo (Colo.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star Journal and Sunday Chieftain</span><span class="font7"> as saying that though the Jews have been widely persecuted they have not been as severely treated as the Bible Searchers (Jehovah’s witnesses), who, because they insist that man owes service only to God, have been virtually exterminated. The same gang in Pueblo itself has tried to do the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Night unto Night Showeth Knowledge” </span><span class="font7">♦ As I walk into silent night, and upward gaze into that spacious dome in which an unseen hand has swung a myriad of scintillating lights, I pause, and feast my eyes and smile and think what power is expressed by these orbs that move with such precision to obey God’s will.

Last June, during the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font7"> booklet campaign, she went alone to the doors and placed twenty-two </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font7"> booklets. She would knock, at the door, then ask, “Would you ’tribute a penny and read this booklet? It’s about God.” If the person had no money, she would continue, “If you promise to read it, I’ll give it to you; then pass it on to someone else.” She always met us with contributions more than covering booklets placed. This spring, during the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine campaign, she put in ten and a half hours alone (not counting all the hours she went with us from door to door), and placed fifteen booklets during that time. This year she asked, “Would you contribute five cents for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism Or Freedom,</span><span class="font7"> and the world-wide broadcast of 'Face the Facts’ ? It’s all about God, and what’s coming here.” While </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">was on a porch next door, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">overheard a lady say, <sup>&lt;r</sup>I haven’t time to read now.” Jayne quickly replied, “Take them now and read them when you have time,”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jayne: Do you like preachers, Gennie</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gennie ; Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jayne: I don’t, and anybody that says that Easter bunnies lay eggs or that there is a Santa Claus is cither lying or don’t know any better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are now reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font7"> to her, and she answers almost any question in the first three chapters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ever since we have had the privilege of raising a child, we have prayed to Jehovah to direct our teaching of her, so that she might take her stand on Jehovah’s side, if it is His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">She has .gone to meetings with us since infancy. We have never permitted her to stay at home in someone else’s care. From the time my parents came into the Truth, in 1913, I went with them, and I know that we children heard discussions at the hall, between our whisperings and seribblings, that we never forgot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">My husband and I are thrilled over the new </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font7"> book.

<p><span class="font7">♦ Once upon a time, up in western New York, a fine young man and his equally fine wife subscribed for a magazine. It’s name was not “Consternation”, as falsely stated by some. As the wife read it she got mad; the more she read, the madder she got; the madder she got, the more she read. Then one of Jehovah’s witnesses called about six times with a Bible and some phonograph records and the lady stopped going to church, and is 'having the happiest times of her life. But she certainly was mad at that 'ignorant editor<sup>7</sup> when the witness first showed up. She was a Catholic, but now she says they don’t get any of her money any more. Just think of all the trouble that 'bad magazine’ made for that priest. ’Sfunny that anybody would print a magazine that would make a woman get mad and quit her “church”, when she eould just as well keep paying and finally land in “Purgatory” if the magazine hadn’t made her mad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Although the brutal practice of flogging with a “cat-o’-nine-tails” has been abolished in the British Army and Naw, it is still practiced in British prisons, the net result thereof being that the one flogged becomes even more degenerate and brutalized. Such a practice is perhaps to be expected in a “religious” country. Eighty years ago England, under the cloak of “religion”, was “civilizing” the world and, incidentally, adding to her empire. The following is quoted from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reynold’s Weekly News</span><span class="font7"> under date February 28, 1858:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The victim of the flogging which took place at Newcastle Barracks was a private of the Northumberland Fusiliers, who had been sentenced by court-martial to 50 lashes. The “cat” with which the torture was inflicted had a handle eight inches long and nine tails of equal length each weighted with pentagonal pieces of steel, 81 in number. The regiment having been paraded on the barracks square, the triangle was set up and the victim was forcibly stripped and tied up. His voice trembling with emotion, he requested them to take his life, but spare him this dishonor. The plea was ignored and forth stepped one of the burliest drummers, armed with the “cat”. At the first blow a piercing shriek rung from the victim in his agony. His lacerated flesh gaped under the blow, and lumps of flesh were detached from his bleeding back at each blow. At the 45th stroke of the instrument—that is, after receiving 405 lashes- the unhappy wretch positively burst his bonds in the contortions of agony and fell a bloody heap to the ground. He was again tied up and another 45 wounds were inflicted. When the poor sufferer was eventually released from his torture, the whole of his spine had been laid bare. He was carried to hospital in a delirious state.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Typical Theocratic War</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE ancient nation of Israel was not organized by any political ruler or dictator or usurper. That was God’s typical nation, a small pattern formed and organized by the great Theocrat for the purpose of picturing the real Theocracy that shall rule the world by the righteous Ruler, Christ Jesus. That nation had no man-made laws and no political parties and no religious advisers to direct any political affairs, as long as that nation remained faithful to the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Earth’s Creator chose the earthly location for His typical theocratic nation. (Deuteronomy 11:12; 32: 8) Jehovah God, the great Theocrat, was the Ruler invisible of that typical nation Israel, and His will the only law of the nation. The Promised Land, assigned to that nation, was previously held in possession by the Canaanites and others devoted to devil-worship and therefore against Jehovah God. That laud Jehovah God had given to Israel’s forefather, Abraham, and to his seed or offspring after him. (See Genesis 13:14-17; 15:18-21; Psalm 105:8-12.) The Canaanites refused to surrender possession to God’s chosen people and refused to come over on the side of the great Theocrat. Therefore they must be ousted. The sole exception thereto was the people of Gibeon, who voluntarily put themselves on the side of Jehovah and who therefore received protection and deliverance at the hand of God’s chosen servant, Joshua, Moses’ minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Israel’s wars against the Canaanites were carried on by the direction of Jehovah God. (Deuteronomy 7:1; Exodus 34:24) Joshua, whose' name means the same as “Jesus” and who foreshadowed Christ Jesus, carried on such wars by the direct command of the great Theocrat, Almighty God, and Joshua gained the victory over the anti-theocratic nations for that reason, ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only nation of earth to which God ever assigned-any territory and which He authorized to take possession of it by force was Israel. Hence the wars of Israel for gaining</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 7, 1940 </span><span class="font7">possession of what belonged to them by the gift of Almighty God foreshadowed the taking possession by Christ Jesus of the entire earth, as a gift to Him by Jehovah God, Christ Jesus acting under the command of the Almighty. (Psalm 2:6-12) In entering Canaan, the Israelites did not invade that which belonged to others. They took the land that belonged to them by a gift from Jehovah. Their participation in war was by His command, and their obedience to His commandment was more acceptable to Him than sacrifice. (1 Samuel 15:20-23) Such wars were righteous. Hence God heard and answered the prayers of His typical people as long as they obeyed Him. Victory was not granted to them by reason of their superior military equipment, but because God exercised His almighty power in their behalf. (Joshua 10:14) Later King David carried out God’s command in taking possession of the entire domain which the great Theocrat had assigned to His typical people. Thus he pictured the Greater David, Christ Jesus, taking possession of the entire earth, at the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">None of the nations of “Christendom” ever had any territory assigned to them by the great Theocrat, Jehovah. The so-called “Christian” nations have taken possession of land by what they call “the right of discovery” or by purchase or by conquest, and not by God’s will. Hence the wars between the nations of the earth, even defensive wars, find no support or justification in the wars that Israel engaged in. The most powerful religious organization on earth now attempts to justify, war, that is, war now raging between the nations, and hence the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority urges the religionists of the various nations to take sides and go to war. Evidently they have overlooked their own previously announced conclusions upon this point. Some conscientious member of the Hierarchy at one time wrote and published the correct position in this matter, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, also, it is to be noted that nations cannot draw a parallel from the Old-Testament titles. The Israelites lived under a theocracy; God, as Supreme Lord of all the earth, in specific instances, by the exercise of His supreme dominion, transferred the ownership of alien lands to the Israelites; by His command they waged war to obtain possession of it, and their title to war was the ownership (thus given them) of the land for which they fought. The privation thus wrought upon its prior owners</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and actual </span><span class="font7">possessors had, moreover, the Character of punishment visited upon them by God’s order for offences committed against Him. No state can find such title existing for itself under the natural law.—The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Volume 15, under the heading “War”, and subheading “IV. The Title and Purpose of War”; page 548, column 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Israelites’ wars, which Jehovah approved, were for the purpose of taking possession of their own land. Outside of their own territory as assigned to them by the Lord they were not authorized to extend their warfare to any more territory at any time. (See Deuteronomy 2; 1-9,19,37.) When the Holy Land was invaded by other nations the Israelites were authorized to fight in a defensive </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">war </span><span class="font7">against such invaders. (2 Kings 18: 9-37; 19:1-36; 2 Chronicles 14:9-15) When the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">enemy </span><span class="font7">proved to be internal and rose up against God and His people in war, the Israelites were authorized to fight in self-defense and to subdue the anti-theocratic uprising of such internal enemy. Such was the rule that God gave to the Israelites. (See Judges, chapters 3 to 16.) In the wars that raged between the nations in the outside world beyond the boundaries of the Theocratic territory of Israel, the Israelites were commanded to remain neutral, and as long as faithful to Jehovah they did remain neutral. When they violated that neutrality they suffered defeat and did not have God’s help. (See 2 Kings 23: 29-35; 2 Chronicles 35: 20-24.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Union of religion and state does not make a Theocracy. There is no so-called “Christian nation” of so-called “Christendom” that is a theocracy, or any part of Jehovah’s Theocracy, because not one of such nations even claims Almighty God as the Ruler. All these nations are rilled according to man’s law. The law of the political governments is not theo- , eratic. The interest of the state and the interest of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government are not common. The ordinances or laws of the state do not express the will of Almighty God, because God has not authorized any political nation to act for Him. “Jesus answered, Aly kingdom is not of this world [of which ‘Christendom’ is a part]; if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence [not from the source of ‘Christendom’].”—John 18:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Says the Word of the great Theocrat: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance.” (Psalm 33:12, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font7">Not one nation within the realm of so-called “Christendom” has Jehovah for its God and Ruler, but all such nations hate Jehovah God and His government by Christ Jesus and hate those who bear testimony to Jehovah’s name and His Theocratic Government. The Theocracy is the heavenly, invisible government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, the King, who is invisible to human eyes. That Government is not allied with or represented by any religious, political, judicial government on the earth. If the church-state governments were a part of Jehovah’s Theocracy, then there would be only one government, under one Leader, Christ Jesus. Hence there could be no war between them, Christ is not divided. The Theocracy is one inseparable, righteous government, always righteous.</span></p>

The situation in India is therefore always propitious for those who enjoy fighting. India is occupied by two different peoples, with different religions. The majority, to the number of 380,005,000, are Hindus, while 80,000,000 are Moslems, who formerly ruled the majority as a colonial empire. The new Federal Assembly for India, granted by Great Britain after long agitation on the part of both Moslems and Hindus, threatens to be so thoroughly under the control of the Hindus that the Moslems are beginning to balk, and say they want a separate Moslem state. Britain may not be averse to the idea. The old formula of “Divide and rule” is not forgotten. Meanwhile Germany is stirring up trouble in India by means of shortwave broadcasts^ predicting that a Moslem Hitler will arise when the time comes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Th AY S’ OF OUR YEARS,</span><span class="font7"> Pierre van Paas-</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">U</span><span class="font7"> sen’s 520-page book, published by Hillman-Curl, Ine., New York, is a terrible indictment, from an eye-witness, of the rascalities of at least six great governments posing as God’s government on earth. It is not possible to give more than a hint of the contents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Van Paassen, a British subject, of Netherlands birth and international training, is a modest, truthful, conscientious man. As </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">soldier on the side of the Allies, in “the war to end war” and “to make the world safe for democracy”, he narrates that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, The first blood we saw was the coagulated, fly-infested chunks of human flesh that the Gurkhas from India carried fastened to. their belts: trophies of war—ears, noses, sexual organs, and whole heads of German soldiers whom these valiant men from the East had massacred in a nocturnal raid. [Page 66]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some millions of good people in the world who believe, or try to believe, that the British Government is the holy-of-holics of democracy, and, as such, is most certainly the highest of the “higher powers” to which men in this world should be subject. These Gurkhas were in France as guests of the British Government, and, no doubt, were carefully instructed as to its will, as was Van Paassen himself. Perhaps the less said about that instruction, the better; but the net result may be noted, and of that result the author continues on the same page:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have never heard of a single ease of chivalry or pity towards the enemy, either in the Great War or in the subsequent campaigns in Syria, Ethiopia and Spain which I followed as a correspondent. The French took it for granted that any gray-clad creature that could still crawl or move a finger had to be finished without further ado. Wounded men, xn fact, had less of a chance of life when discovered by so-called “mopping-up” patrols than prisoners of war, for a prisoner was considered somebody who had voluntarily thrown up the sponge, whereas of a wounded man one never knew if he would not recover and become a dangerous antagonist again at some time in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Rape of Palestine</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Van Paassen does not call his Palestine story by that name, but that is what the Jews themselves call it, and Van Paassen’s story is the same as theirs. The gist of the story is that the British administrators of Palestine took their means of protection away from the Jews and gave them to the Arabs; they knew in advance when Arab attacks would occur; they' paid the persons involved in making those attacks; when the raids occurred, the surviving Jews were arrested and jailed and the marauders were let go scot-free. Van Paassen quotes the following as a statement which he made to H. C. Luke, acting high commissioner of Palestine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For instance, the ease of Mr. Brozen. Here was an old man with forty years’ residence in the Holy Land. He owns a little canning factory near Motza. The other day a band of Arabs from the nearby village of Lifta attacked his house while he was absent. They were bad Arabs, just cutthroats and highway robbers, even in Turkish days. They killed his wife and two daughters. Then they moved onto the factory. Brozen saw them coming, locked the door, and pointed a rifle between the bars of a window. At this the Arabs contented themselves with smashing the machinery in the outlying buildings and withdrew. But we,” I said, speaking as a British subject, “we had Mr. Brozen arrested and I saw him a week ago as he was being brought to Jerusalem in chains, an old man of sixty-five, an enterprising citizen in chains, Mr. Luke, led by British soldiers.” [Page 376]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the same page Van Paassen narrates how he told Mr. Luke at the same time of the ease where 50 Jews took refuge in the flour mills of Haifa to defend themselves when attacked by a crowd of 2,000 Arabs, with the net result that the Jews were jailed and the Arabs were sent free. And on the next two pages are the details of the massacre of the colony of Hulda. In this instance, on the first demand of the government that the Jews surrender the tin box which contained their rifles, those citizens urged that the guns be taken away at night secretly, so that the Arabs would not know of it and be encouraged to make an attack. But the next day at noon an Arab patrol eame with a truck for the rifles, collected the arms by authority of the Palestine government, and nine days later the colony was destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It took a good many people a long time to find out why there is so much trouble in Palestine, but it did not take Van Paassen so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For many years a trained newspaper correspondent, he had the courage to write the truth. Here is extract from page 408:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400207_files/g_E_19400207-12.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:253pt;">
<p><span class="font7">The face of the earth</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The history of the seventeen years of mandatory regime in Palestine reveals an unbroken succession of restrictive measures, acts of pettifogging chicanery, niggardliness and outright opposition on the part of the Administration to the Jewish National enterprise. When the Arab mob in 1929 shouted: &quot;The government is with us,” and threw themselves upon the Jewish colonies which had first been disarmed by the Administration, they' gave a true expression of the situation, I know this is a grave charge to make, but I convinced myself on the spot that the uprising of that year was deliberately fomented by the authorities, and that the terror and destruction were but a camouflaged attempt on their part, not only to discourage the Jewish spirit of initiative, but to show the world in an unmistakable manner that the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine was a foolish Utopian drcam which would ultimately go to pieces on the rock of Arab intransigence. The impression had to be created that while England had done all in its power to carry out its pledges to the Jewish people, it had found its plans thwarted and nullified by Arab opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Van Paassen’s explanation of this curious attitude of mind of the British Government occurs on the same page. It seems that the British colonial experts have figured it out that the future pivot of the British Empire will be Palestine, that it lies geographically in- the center of the Moslem world, and that therefore it is Britain’s first duty to herself to get all the Arabs firmly convinced that she is their greatest, truest and best friend. What more natural to Perfidious Albion than to sacrifice even the blood brothers of Jesus Christ on the altars of her imperial ambitions? If willing to unhesitatingly offer up Czechoslovakia to make friends with Hitler,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 7, 1940 </span><span class="font7">do you see anything incongruous in offering up Zionism to make friends with Mahomet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Lion of the Tribe of Judah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After a glance at the British lion’s part in maintaining peace and justice in the earth, one is the better prepared for a little consideration of the rule of Haile Selassie, who was wont to be known as the “Lion of the Tribe of Judah”, and whose government of Ethiopia was even worse than Britain’s government of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the summer of 1934, Hitler had proposed to cover Paris with a blanket of poison gas in the night and to follow this up with a fleet of two thousand bombers which would rain the heaviest torpedoes and incendiary bombs on the city, and all this without a declaration of war. Mussolini refused to go along, tipped off the French, and Laval told him, as a reward, that he could go ahead and take Ethiopia and nobody would seriously interfere, and, as a matter of fact, nobody did.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. At th* request _pt «iy client, th* Rav&amp;rand Arthur-1.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The action is entitled Arthur I* Townley vs. Province of the Holy Nam*, a corporation;. *t al., end is numbered 4125 1, haying bean instituted in the United States District Court for thto Northern Diitriot of California, Southern Division, end. was begun on the dth day of January, 193^. Judonent was entered, after trial, in favor of defendant, on the £8th day of February, 1939, and -the decision is reported in volume 29 of th* Federal Supplement, at page 654. A motion for e new trial was denied on the 1st day of May, 1939, and the time for appeal La still open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Th* basis of the claim of Father Townley,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the plaintiff, la as follows: Prior to the time that plaintiff became a member of the Dorninloan Order of the Bonen. Catholic Church he was held in great esteem by hi* QOdvparent* and had been promised, by them, their property, which the survivor of them should die* On the eve the making of hi* solemn vows in the Dominloan Order he<sup>1</sup>told hie superiors that he expected, this property and that he Md </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">do</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> other property and they told him that be should make a &quot;will’ to dispose of this property, which he did by copying a document which they wrote for him. By this &quot;Till&quot; be gave to his mother, and in the event of her death, to other*, his property. Ke subsequently tock * vow of poverty and obedience and became a full member of the</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Thee* Bitter* are *• follow*: {1} The common laws and th* constitutions of the order, which the* internal rule* of the order, have bean shown by the evidence to to be the same on this point and to be the same today as they were in 1909, when the &quot;will’ was made and at a time when they were not codified a* they or* no*. There is no dispute on this point. The constitutions say that property v*yflikewise be renounced, which is ejected by certain hope (&quot;la carta spe in the latin words of the eonstituticn*), There la no restriction to these word* that would limit their application to inheritance from blood relatives. Th* defendant put on the stand so-called experts who stated to th* Court that there w*y* such restriction*. Over the abjection* of plaintiff their testimony was accepted and no written offense of such restriction was preaantad. NO textj nothing but th* word* of men who wen* not sufficiently educated to know whether there was such a restriction. This admission of evidence is, I believe, on error for the Court should have ootfpelMfe.defendant to produce its internal rules so that th* Court end plaintiff could, see thee if It ■ought to predicate its decision upon such evidense, (2) Th* &quot;will&quot;' which was Introduced in evidence was made by plaintiff! before he was taken Into the order and ought to operate to carry out its intent irrespective of what ar* the internal rules on th* ground that plaintiff was induced to change his position in reliance upon the fact that the text of the will would be carried out. The Court erred, I believe, in excluding from evidence an admission of one of the men who helped plaintiff to make his will, that this was considered th* proper way to handle the matter and that this should have safeguarded plaintiff. The Court refused’ admission of this evidence on the ground that it was in th* nature of in^esehmeut on a witness who wae present by depc-Siti on end that he should have been questioned on it first, but our stand was that it was being introduced not as impeaching evidence but a* an admission which did not require each, a foundation. There are other matter* which I do not need at this time, to go into.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">V* have the following document* to substantiate our position: (1) The &quot;will;&quot; (a) The books of the canon law and constitutions showing clearly the phrase *in carta sps&quot; with no restriction* whatsoever; (3) Books on th* canon law and constitution* which do not show any such restriction;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The trial Itself resolved several matter* 1° favor of plaintiff, namely, that plaintiff was not prejudiced by any purported delay in pressing hi* claims in court, and that the ec-aallad hearing held in Rom* on the question could not b« binding.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A* you might suppose there ar* many detail* 'of intrigue and brutal selfishness disclosed by a trial of this nature.

<p><span class="font7">In 1935, when the Italians were hammering at the gates of Ethiopia, Van Paassen saw in the capital hundreds of boys and girls, roped together, being led into slavery. The hoys had been castrated, not skillfully, but with a clear sweep of the sword.' Many died every day. The marching was done at night because officially the slave trade, was forbidden. The Unsexed boys were to become prostitutes (Nazi style) for the Arabs in Arabia. This'particular kind of prostitution is forbidden in the holy month of Kam ad an.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Vatican Lion</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font7"> he dared tell what he knows, every man that has been a newspaper correspondent much less than Van Paassen’s 35 years of such activity knows enough about the history of the Vatican “Lion of the Tribe of Judah” to make him shudder as badly as about the Ethiopian one. In 1933 Van Paassen had the ill fortune to spend ten days in the Dachau prison camp, Germany. One of his comrades was an Italian lad, Eugenio Narduzzi. Maybe you can stand it to read what happened to this tad. It comprises a pretty complete picture of the civilization of which Vatican City is the center and of which Hitler and Mussolini are two of the most prominent figures;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At one of the interviews with the camp commander, his torturers, in order to extract names and addresses of comrades, applied wooden clamps to his testicles, an instrument which the Inquisition bequeathed to Benito Mussolini, and the Duee to the Fuehrer. Eugenio Narduzzi diqd in the camp hospital on March 23, 1933. The notice on the bulletjn board said the cause of his death was appendicitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It could truthfully be said that the British “Lion” would not descend to this depth in which the Vatican “Lion” still lies; it would not dare; but it could and did dare to connive at the Vatican “Lion’s” having its way in Spain, and the United States was a guilty party to it. Van Paassen has told the story well in the chapter “L’lnfame”. In the time of it, much of that story was told in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The war in Spain was started after a campaign of lying rarely equaled in history.-You heard about the churches’ being fired “by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 7, 1940</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reds”. This is what President Azaua said to Van Paassen on that subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In every instance where the perpetrators of these outrages have been caught in the act they turned out to be members of the Fascist falange or of the extreme Right. In several cases they were found with membership cards of labor org.mization in their pockets—plain agents provocateurs. It has been clear to the government that the reaction finds the victory of the Popular Front too hard a pill to swdllow. It is doing its utmost to create the impression abroad that unbridled license and terror have come to Spain with the triumph of the democratic parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Van Paassen shows that three days before B'raneo started his revolt the Italian Government (acting, of course, on instructions from the Vatican) dispatched six planes to Spanish Morocco, and every one of the planes had ten machine guns aboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the direction of Dr. Goebbels, Nazi clubs and consuls in Spain were ordered to invent atrocity stories for publication in the German press. Yon probably read some of those stories and accepted them for gospel truth. But the real atrocities dared not be told, terrible atrocities by Catholics against Catholies. Van Paassen says, page 460:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nowhere did Fascist ruthlessness reach such a depth of ignominy as in the Catholic Basqueland. Not satisfied with shooting down men and women whom the Moors, Italians and Carlists found peacefully laboring in the fields, or locking inhabitants in their homes and setting these on fire, they systematically destroyed evacuated villages. Bombs on the churches where large congregations were at worship. Bombs on the hospitals. Bombs on the schools. Hand grenades thrown into the maternity ward of San Sebastian’s clinic, mixing in one bloody mass mothers, infants, and nursing sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Great French Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You have no doubt heard a great deal about the great French democracy, and have considered how fortunate is mankind to have such a champion of justice, equality and fraternity, to hold back the totalitarian monstrosities, now stretching in a line from the heel of Italy to the Arctic Circle, from overrunning the rest of humanity, meaning thereby Britain and America. But maybe you never did any traveling in French Equatorial Africa; but Van Paassen did, on his journey from Spain to Ethiopia, and you may have three paragraphs, to think about:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the Chad region batches of young men are shipped away every spring into Nigeria and Equatorial Africa to work rubber plantations, a distance fully equal to that from New York to Salt Lake City. They never return. Their parents and relatives never hear of them again. If they refuse to leave they are beaten with whips of hippopotamus leather. If they hide, the village elders are imprisoned; frequently the women and children are maltreated before their eyes to make them give up their resistance. Passive resistance on the part of a tribe or clan is followed with collective punishment: destruction of their villages of straw and mud and relentless man hunts in the forests where the populations go into hiding. What life is like for the native laborers in the concessions may be gathered from the report of M. Albert Lend res on the construction of the railway which is to run from Chad to the coast of Equatorial Africa, that is to say, to the Atlantic Ocean, Of the thirty thousand contract laborers employed in 1928, but seven thousand were alive a year later. Of the twenty-seven thousand driven to work the next year, eighteen thousand perished before nine months were over. It will take at least ten more years to complete that line, after which it is to have branches running off into the Congo. [Page 296] [Page 297 has the following:]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I watched lumbering operations for a few days in Ubangi, south of the lake’s shore. Eight thousand black men were employed there. As in wartime, there was a daily list of casualties: on Monday ten killed, Tuesday nine, Wednesday fifteen— and so on. The wounded and maimed were not even mentioned. Who cares? Tomorrow another gang arrives. Ten villages had just been raided. The young men have been rounded up. They will take the place of the human cattle that become unusable today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Forty men were poised over a gigantic log which had to be lifted to a flatcar on the forest rail. Another hundred men stood looking on, the reserve. The whips of the European slave drivers cracked. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Alles!&quot;</span><span class="font7"> Lift! The forty blacks strained on the log, their muscles bulged, their eyes protruded from their sockets. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Alles, Alles!&quot;</span><span class="font7"> Down eame the whips on the naked flesh, lacerating it, tearing the skin off, making the blood run down the men’s legs. The log did not budge. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Alles!&quot;</span><span class="font7"> Ten more. Make room for ten. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Quick!&quot;</span><span class="font7"> The whips zoomed through the air again. One black, who stumbled, received such a beating that he could not rise. A guard jumped on his face with two heavy-shod feet and crunched his heel in the fallen man’s mouth. The man did not let out a whimper. The others looked on, silent, sullen, the sweat of fear pouring down their limbs. Again the whips crashed down. The four guards worked themselves into a hysteria beating the blacks, running along the lines, kicking, battering, lashing. At last the log moved. But one fellow’s arm was caught under it. He howled, not in pain, but for what he knew was coming. Two guards jumped on him, stamping on his abdomen, his chest, kicking him in the face, until he groaned and lapsed into unconsciousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Fascism in the English Church”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The people of Britain at the present time have the opportunity of reading a book of more than ordinary interest to them. It is entitled “Fascism in the English Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of the author—described as “A London Journalist”—is of no interest to Christians, since it is to encourage a revival of Evangelical Religion, and the followers of Christ know that religion of every kind is cast out and doomed (and, reading between the lines, so does the author of the book). But it is of interest to all people of good will, on account of information it contains on the subject of the position today of the so-called “Church of England”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This journalist of England, apparently, is not blind to the activities of the Catholic Hierarchy at the present time, and he is duly alarmed. Also, he is a lover of liberty and, which is somewhat rare these days, a believer in the Bible as the Word of God. One of the most pleasing filatures of his work is the man-</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>in (2)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">nor in which he shows how archaeological research has shaken to the foundation the mountain of lies built up by the Modernists and Rationalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, “Fascism in the English Church” is his theme, and his ease in a nutshell is this: In 1928 there was submitted to the English Parliament the New Prayer Book Measure. The purpose of this was to make alterations in the English Prayer Book. What was the trend of these alterations? You can guess, of course. It was to reintroduce into the so-called “Protestant Church” certain of the Romish practices which had been thrown out by the people at the time of the Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At that time the Hierarchy was taking a back seat in England. Also Parliament retained something of the spirit of democracy. It turned down the new prayer book. And, naturally, one would believe that there was an end of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your religionist is an obstinate cuss. Also, he has little use for democracy. And so, no</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sooner had the people’s representatives in England kicked out the new prayer book than the bishops set about seeing that it should be introduced into the churches of the country. This they have done by appointing to the various livings men who are known to be in favor of the terms of revision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And so today up and down the country-side are to be found more and more so-called “Anglo-Catholic” clergymen, who are introducing into the church services all the practices of the Roman Church which bring a reproach upon the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The London journalist cites evidence such as the following, in 1932 “reservation of the sacrament” was being practiced in eighty-one parishes in the diocese of London alone. At an Anglo-Catholic meeting in the Caxton Hall, Westminster, in 1936, it was reported that 1,016 “Church of England” clergymen had signed a statement declaring their agreement with the decrees of the Roman Catholic Church I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At another point the author states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Report on Church Doctrine indicates clearly that however much an ordinand [one who is being ordained as a clergyman] may disagree with the standards of belief and practice as laid down in the Prayer Book [as constituted at present] he is quite free to make solemn vows concerning them without feeling any twinge of conscience, because he holds in mental reservation many of the statements he makes in the vows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many young clergymen are doing this every year, find the author comments:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can we wonder that the obvious comment was made in a weekly newspaper: “In the business world men have a much higher moral standard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And so in Britain today the “Church of England” is beginning to wear quite a Fascist air. The people have rejected the reintreduction of Roman Catholic practices, but the clergy reintroduce them all the same. The people have signified their disapproval of Anglo-Catholic clergymen, but more and more are being thrust upon them every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Writes our enlightened journalist:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The modem Pharisees and Sadducees [he knows a lot] . . . are adopting dictatorial measures of government, introducing ecclesiastical Fascism, coercing the people to shout their approbation on issues they do not understand. They are introducing ecclesiastical showmanship with vestments and genuflections, and priestly tyranny with secret confession, the mass, reservation and adoration. They are generalizing lawlessness, treating covenants and solemn affirmations as “scraps of paper”, making</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 7, 1940 </span><span class="font7"> promises with the clear knowledge that they never intend to keep them . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anyone with half an ounce of perception can see what will be the end of all this. An “Anglo-Catholic” is merely a dishonest Roman Catholic, v</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On this subject the author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism in the English Church</span><span class="font7"> has one of the most significant statements in the whole of his book to make. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rome makes no compromises. If ever union takes place between any body and the Church of Rome, it will be abject subjection, complete absorption. The pope remains the dictator, supreme at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the constitution of the British nation the Church and its ministers are the servants of the people. There is abundant evidence that today it plots to become its master —and then to hand the people over in bondage to 'the power that the Lord has foretold shall eventually rule the whole e'arth’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But that dominion shall be short-lived, and all these workers of iniquity shall then receive their just reward.—Norris Willatt, England.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Drained the Chalice</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The vicar of St. Martin’s church in West Acton, London, appealed to his congregation to go easy on the communion wine, saying in his parish magazine, “Three times recently it has been necessary to reconsecrate wine . . . One of the first communicants practically drained the chalice.” Many Church of England ministers are known as favoring the Roman Catholic method, where only the priests get the wine.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Prices of Shirts</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Shirts are made in Japan and landed in the heart of Britain at only a trifle more than half the actual cost of production in British mills. For example, boys’ tennis shirts are being offered at 4|d. (9e) each and men’s khaki shirts with zip fasteners at 15|d. each, or about 31c American money. It costs the British about 58c to make such a shirt, and they simply cannot compete.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Clean and Clever</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The newspaperman who referred to the claims of weakness put forth by both Britain and France, that they could not do otherwise than what they did to Czechoslovakia at the Munich sell-out, was both clean .and clever when he said that in making these claims of weakness neither country was clean or clever. He used just the right words.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It takes considerable impudence for two governments that absolutely deny freedom of speech and repudiate freedom of the press to go to a small next-door neighbor and demand that the press of the country submit to a censorship in their behalf ■ but the German and Italian ministers to Switzerland had the gall to wait upon the Swiss government with just such a demand. They wanted the Swiss government to promise that Swiss papers should refrain from any critical comment on German or Italian affairs, and to refrain from reporting facts which Germans and Italians do not wish reported. What else can be done with such diplomats but to grab them by the nape of the neck and the seat of the pantaloons and throw them sprawling across their own borders? It is a problem enough to tax the wisdom of a Solomon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Isaac Lcifer had a big idea, but it didn’t work. He went to Paris, gave himself the title of Grand Rabbi of Brooklyn, and got a bookbinder to make secret pockets in the covers of Bibles, which Leifer said would be filled with holy sand from Jerusalem. Leifer filled the pockets with narcotics' and started for the United States, but the police of Paris grabbed him before he got out of the city, and found the narcotics, and now the Grand Rabbi will have two years in a French prison to think it over.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Five thousand gold pieces were discovered in the wall of a room in Paris, where they had lain for 168 years. The heirs to the wealth are now being located. When the owner was about to die he took this means of hiding his wealth from his wife, but the daughter for whom it was intended never saw any of it. A very poor woman lived in the house for 25 years, with the headboard of her bed against the wall where the money was concealed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Switzerland in recent years extended large credits to Germany. Some return on this precarious investment cart be had by the education of German students at Swiss universities. The Germans know this only too well, and so do the Swiss, who are thus caught between the Devil and the deep blue sea. They want the German students for economic reasons, but dread their presence for political ones. Commenting on this Swiss dilemma the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font7"> remarks in italics that, as for Germany, “if economic pressure is not enough, no doubt force will be used as well.” It would be interesting to see the seat of the League of Nations itself swallowed up by the totalitarian monstrosity; and this is not at all impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ June 28 is called St. Vitus Day. On that day in 1914, in Sarajevo, Gabrillo Prineip assassinated the Austrian archduke Francis and his wife, and so brought on the World War. On that day, five years later, the representatives of Germany and the Allies signed the Versailles treaty. Twenty more years went by and Premier Daladier said, on the same day of the year, “The situation in Europe and the world today is the gravest in 20 years.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Since the above was said, the World War was renewed; the situation grows worse.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Marseille, claimed to be the worst-managed city in France, is said to have two murderers and other criminals on the city pay rolls, to have the most expensive and worst-run hospitals in France, and to have a debt that has quadrupled in seven years. One woman was arrested for selling beggars’ licenses of her own manufacture, and claimed to have inherited the business from her mother.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">France is a land of contradictions, but surely nothing stranger has happened in its history than the taxpayers of a country financing a movement intended to de</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">stroy their government and replace it by a monarchy. That seems to be the kernel of the Croix-de-Feu-les-Cagoulards affair, -wherein the then prime minister, M.

Ybarnegaray, was supplied with 30,000 francs from the Secret Service fund to pay his election expenses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Spanish Refugee Camps</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Spanish refugee camps in France (450,000 in them at one time) were reputed to be places of horror. There were no sanitary arrangements, and as a consequence the drinking water, pumped up from six feet below the surface, was contaminated and sixty percent of the refugees had dysentery. Men and women, diseased and healthy, could bathe only in the sea. One loaf of bread a day had to do for six persons, and one sack of rice for 400. Because of blowing sand many suffered from conjunctivitis. Though the camps were devoid of all comforts, they were reputed to be costing the French $185,000 a day.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>The French Dictator</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The swing to dictatorships is so swift as to take one’s breath. On March 19, 1939, by a vote of 286 to 14 the French Government voted to suspend animation as a republic until the end of November. During those more than seven months Premier Edouard Daladier ruled by decree, and now so rules indeterminately. What tile end will be, no man knows; and when the dictatorship will end, no man knows. It is easy enough to start a dictatorship, but to stop it is like trying to stop an avalanche.</span></p>

The French put a large number of pigs into the area, to root about as they pleased. After the porkers were all blown to bits the French moved forward. They lost some bacon, but saved a good many French boys.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>The European Pariahs</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Appenzeller Aeitting</span><span class="font7"> (Switzerland) brings a heart-rending report, of facts about concentration camps and refugee wretchedness, and says as introduction :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">India has her pariahs. Such are casteless people without rights, a despised, outcast, and disgraced mass, people with no claim on respect and honor of human dignity. Europe is not better. Europe has also its pariahs, hunted from country to country, ridiculed, cursed and outcast children of men, homeless, dishonored and without rights. What </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">disgrace to the culture and religion of progressive Europe! To what have we arrived? Is the Occident ready for destruction, that we have sunk so low that we are creating among us the caste of the pariah? Where are human rights? Whore is freedom? Where is pure humanity? True, European states have much needed and beneficial societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, but who assists in establishing in Europe the urgently needed societies for the prevention of cruelty to men?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be forced to witness from day to day the wretchedness of the European pariahs, and day after day to hear of their distress, is almost unbearable, and it: cannot be borne alone or silently. Those who witness these things not only must cry out in distress, but could wish that their voices could be thunderous, so that their hearers might be stirred to the very depths of their hearts. That which is being unfolded here before our eyes, day after day, all over Europe, is a most horrible tragedy; a tragedy’ of more terrible, heartless, wicked and tragic scenes than any dramatist ever conceived. Oh, what judgment will be meted out by history in a few hundred years from now for the inhumanity of the twentieth century!

<h4><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>British Comment</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By J. ITemery (London)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>A</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Pacifist Among the Parsons</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• When the bishop of Birmingham wrote to the Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font7"> pointing out that Jehovah’s witnesses in their attitude toward war arc faithfully following the teachings of Jesus, and are in line in this with the early disciples, before religionists fell into the arms of the world, h£ caused a flutter in religious dovecotes. The bishop is a pacifist, not of the stop-the-war kind, and, of course, he is not an opposer of the Government; he is convinced that discipleship of Jesus Christ and war a.re altogether contrary the one to the other, and he is ready to defend his position, as his letter showed. He quoted historical authority to support his statement that the early disciples saw clearly that a follower of Christ must take no part in war. As was to be expected, the ready writers and commentators jumped to the occasion, and would like to jump on the bishop. They prove ( !) their attitude in support of militant “Christianity” by quoting other “fathers” of the church, and are much distressed because he does not throw his influence in with them. But they think they have caught out the bishop in a bad slip. Tie concluded his letter by saying, “I seem to remember that Christ said, 'Blessed are the pacifists.’ ” That turn from exactness of quotation is too much for the religionists. It was a rapier thrust they must repay; so they make the bishop into a twister of the words of Jesus, vexed that he should get the better of them by the nimble misuse of .the word rendered “peacemakers”. As has been shown, Jesus was neutral in the disputes of the nations. So were the apostles whom He sent forth to teach the peoples, and so are His true disciples today, and neither the bishop, a.s a. partisan for pacifism, nor the great majority of the religionists in their misuse of Jesus’ words and of His spirit in their partisanship in warfare can claim Him in support.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>An Unholy Mix-up</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The claim of the popes of Rome, that each in turn is the head of the church of God upon earth and the direct representative of God, includes that of a right to name the pope “Holy Father”, and now and again, 'when occasion serves, the “holy father” blesses “the city and the world”. The present war in Europe is giving the Vatican a troubled time; for good Roman Catholics in Britain and France are called upon to fight for that which their governments have declared to be the objectives of the war, while in Germany similar good Roman Catholics are urged to fight the enemies, who, they say, would destroy their land and its liberties. That section of religionists report the Catholic population of Germany as high as 35,000,000 in number. Apart from the general question of helping to maintain peace in the earth, -which a good father must do, this matter of members of the same “church” being engaged in mortal combat is a great concern, and unquestionably the interests of the “church” have had much to do with the pope’s endeavors to avert the war, and, now that it is begun, to try to bring it to an end. The hierarchy in Britain kept rather quiet when the conflict seemed as if it was to be one between the nations of France and Britain and Germany, and the fact that Britain was bargaining with Russia was a sore matter to them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">But the Roman Catholics are not alone in this quandary of a mix-up. The Protestants of Britain and Germany have the same trouble. Tn both countries the leaders of religion are filled with righteous indignation against the wickedness which has thrown the nations into war. The churches in Britain, whatever the section by which they are known, see that the present rulers of Germany are pursuing a policy which will destroy all that they believe religion represents; would in fact reduce it to the condition of being merely a chattel of the State, and, like the Papacy, they are ready to fight for the church and the interests of religion. On the other hand the leaders of the German brand of Protestantism see in Britain a nation aggressive, and willing to throw the world into war for national greed and because of jealousy. One of these leaders, a bishop T.ugel, is reported from a church journal published in Hamburg as saying, “By the guilt of England the war goes on. By the grace of God, the Fuehrer still lives.” He accuses England of having rejected the generous peace overtures of the Fuehrer, and of claiming divine right for world domination by the British Empire. He says the old enemy of 1914 is again the enemy in 1939, and to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">fight him with all their might is the God-given task of Germans. “Hell rages,” he continues, “but the Fuehrer lives. Germany thanks God for so graciously preserving the life of our Fuehrer by a miracle.” (The latter reference is to the strange attempt upon the life of Hitler, when the bomb exploded after he had left the building at a time somewhat in advance of his expected departure.) So, the German bishop prays, “God bless the Fuehrer”; but no English bishop, though ready to encourage those who are engaged in the actual fighting to destroy the power of the Fuehrer, will.dare to express the contrary prayer. There are yet some who will remember how the “Heverend Doctor” Joseph Parker shocked England in the days of the Bulgarian atrocities, perpetrated by Abdul, the sultan of Turkey, atrocities much less in extent than those regularly reported in these days as items of daily news. The “reverend doctor”, in his pulpit in Nonconformity’s (London) City Temple, told of his impatience with the soft words and phrases used about the sultan, and the prayers offered that he might amend his ways. He said his prayer was, “God damn the sultan.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no question about the fact that the war has made many come to the conclusion that it involves much more than the possible destruction of Hitlerism with its a^ressive and ruthless expansion of power. They see the war fires spreading, and the possibility of all Europe’s being caught in the flames. Many realize that, whatever the result of the present actual conflict, there must come great changes in Europe, and that the nations can continue to exist only if there isda federation of States of such a character as toll bring the peoples into a community of interests. The “haves”, those who have enjoyted the things which money and power can give, will fight hard to maintain their possessions, while those who seek to get a more equal share for the multitudes, the “have nots”, and who are considered as the toilers for the lesser number, will strive to make the most of the readjustments which must follow the upheaval now started. Men are beginning to fear the things coming on the earth, even as Jesus foretold, and undoubtedly the religionists are most sensitive to this. Probably it would be true to say they will be the first to experience that fear. Already they see the perilous condition in which religion is situated. Vast numbers of persons all through the earth have discarded religion as it is represented by its</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1940 </span><span class="font7">priests and leaders: they have no use for it, and the numbers of those who give it place </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">national life but consider it only as one of its factors are increasing at a quickened rate. The word “debunked”, which came into the English language after the Great War,-—an ugly word, but very expressive—-serves well to describe what is coming to the great systems of religion which have fastened themselves on the nations and on the peoples. Its day of rejection is not yet fully come, and no doubt it has a great part to play in its last endeavors to get a place in the lives of the peoples; but the Word of God is the fixed expression of His purpose and it clearly tells that this feature of Great Babylon will be destroyed and in the beginning of the battle of the great day of God Almighty. ,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>Begging for Bread</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Perhaps not that exactly, but it serves to illustrate the unscripturalness of the claim of the churches to be God’s representatives </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">the earth. The Roman Catholic newspapers are laden with begging appeals for their causes. Their saint Mary, the most powerful of all the saints-—her appeal in heaven is said to be as powerful as that of all the other saints put together—seems to treat her patrons on earth with but scanty attention, for appeals in her name are the most numerous. The whole begging system is so contrary to the teachings and spirit of Christ and the apostles as to cause wonder that it does not rouse suspicion in the minds of the multitude of Roman Catholics. The church of England is on a different basis, but it has its troubles in trying to provide for local expenses. The vicar of a London church says “the income from the weekly collections is insufficient even to pay the verger’s wages”. He sees no chance of the church’s being able to pay its way “till the people of the parish are converted to the Christian religion and so help to make the church a center of spiritual activity; hut at present that seems as remote as crying for the moon, and we cannot afford to waste our breath in these enlightened days of poison gas”. The poor man has his troubles!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">If</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">General Conditions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Despite the Government’s control of many food prices, fixed to stop the profiteering ramp which would surely have set in, the costs of living increase. There has been an increase in wages in many occupations, some got by ag-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">gressivc action, and some voluntarily given; but the Labor leaders complain that the employees are not fairly dealt with, and that the Government is too lax in its dealings with those who arc engaged in the manufacture of Government necessities, whether armaments or other war materials. The Government places its orders with private firms and it seems that huge profits are being made by some firms. Its emergency powers give it entrance to the works and the books of all concerned in its business, and profiteering would be pounced on and punished in one way or another; but the profiteer is clever in finding ways and means of avoiding the heavy taxes which a needy government imposes on his profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The control of foods, whether for man or for beast, is beginning to be felt. Already the amount of huttcr is limited to four ounces a week; of bacon and ham the same limit is set; sugar may be got at the rate of twelve ounces a week. The cost of clothing is increasing, and woolen goods are going to be difficult to get. Feed for pigs, and cattle feed, also feed for poultry, are not at all plentiful, and may become a serious matter in the endeavor to produce home-killed foods.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>Profits in Ships</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The losses of ships through enemy action must be made good cither by building or buying. Building takes time, and buying is already very costly. Here is an item from the press: “Since the outbreak of the war neutral ships have generally gone up something like 30 to 40 percent, and there are cases of shipowners’ making a profit of 250 percent. The Norwegian steamer “Truth”, built in 1910, changed hands for £16,750 in May, and was sold last month for £59,000. Another vessel of similar tonnage was sold a few days later for £85,000—an appreciation of 300 percent. During the last war the Norwegians made great profits by reason of their freedom of the seas, and there arc few who will blame them if again they take a chance: it is just good business. The present trouble is roping in all the Scandinavian countries, and that part of Europe is apparently to have its part of the tribulation, now fast hastening on to its fullness.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>The Witness to the Kingdom</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• In Britain Jehovah’s witnesses are still in the enjoyment of freedom to carry the message of Jesus Christ, the gospel (good news) of the Kingdom, and to warn the peoples that the judgments of Jehovah, the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, have set in, and will not stop till all His purposes are accomplished. In telling the truth of the Kingdom they must tell of the judgments about to fall on those who have misled the people and have set up what they call “the kingdom of God” for themselves. The Roman Catholic system is the great transgressor in this which has deceived the people, and the exposure of that fact is maddening its priests. These, in turn, as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> has shown, try to set, and in many cases succeed in setting their supporters to do damage to the persons of Jehovah’s witnesses. But the witness goes forward, and must, for God’s time has come, and He has His people ready and willing for His service, under the direction of the organization of His Zion. In this world trouble, quite apparently something which will bring a world upheaval, religionists have no light for themselves or the people. To use a colloquialism, they do not know where they are. Jehovah’s witnesses have tried to enlighten them; but they have set their own seal on themselves and on their work, and must now go on their way to their end.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>Easing Conditions</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Several Roman Catholic bishops in Britain have lifted the ban of the “church” on meateating on Fridays. It is feared that for many fish will be too dear to buy. Probably many Catholics will be unable to purchase either meat or fish; but the lifting of the ban is some gain. Anyway it is a rather good move on the bishops’ part: undoubtedly it will save many an otherwise good Catholic from hurting his conscience by eating meat, and the trouble of having to go to confession to get it cleaned up. And the priests will be able to enjoy their meat on a Friday without having to change it into fish by some passes over it and uttering some cabalistic words to “effect the change”.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>1,600,000 Tin Dog-Houses</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Within less than two months after the war started Britain had completed 1,600,000 portable steel air-raid shelters, commonly known in Britain as “tin dog-houses”, sufficient to provide protection for about 10,000,000 persons. Moreover, Britain claims to be able to duplicate in Germany anything that can be done or may be done in the way of air-raid deviltry by Germans in Britain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain’s Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">♦ Britain now has the lowest maternal mortality death rate in history, and next to the lowest infantile mortality. Deaths by tuberculosis dropped from 4,480 per million to 700; and deaths by typhoid, from 1,228 to 5. Smallpox and cholera have ceased altogether. Infantile paralysis is on the increase, due to pollution of the blood stream by serums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Erosion of Chalk Cliffs</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">♦ Every year the chalk cliffs along the south coast of England wear back about three feet, with an annual loss of about 200 acres of land. Cracks appear at the top of a cliff and after a time a fall occurs. An attempt is now being made to fill these cracks with cement, and also to protect the faces of the cliffs, to see if some of these losses can be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">London’s Deserted Babes</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">♦ In the year 1930 some 9,000 babies were abandoned on doorsteps, park benches, railway stations or in churches in London and </span><span class="font19">became proteges of the London County Council. Last year about 2,000 unwanted children were adopted by this municipal parent. These children are well brought up, and at about sixteen years of age are obtained employment at wages sufficient to maintain them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain’s Crime Wave </span><span class="font19">♦ All who love what is right will be sorry to learn that a huge crime wave is sweeping Britain. In six months jewel thieves stole double the amount ever before recorded, and there is an increase in crime of every type. This is a natural result of the loss of </span><span class="font20">fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">of God, which is bringing all humanity to </span><span class="font20">ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">British Prison Reforms</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">♦ Drastic reforms in the British penal system provide for humanizing prison life and the abolition of whipping and other corporal punishments for young and adult offenders except for serious prison offenses. </span><span class="font20">The House </span><span class="font19">of Commons voted to abolish the death penalty for a period of five years.</span></p>
