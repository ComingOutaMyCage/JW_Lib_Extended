<p><span class="font1">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act ali men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and Is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah's organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;A wise son heareth his father’s instruction.&quot;—Prov. 13:1.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the Father of those who are devoted to him and instructs those who are diligent to ascertain and to do his will. The son is the one who has the promise of life everlasting conditioned upon his knowledge of God and his obedience to the law of God. He must prove his love for God and maintain his integrity toward the Most High. A person is wise only when guided by the Word of God. It is essential, therefore, that the person who would be wise must study God’s Word and sincerely endeavor to receive God’s approval. Tn harmony with this conclusion the faithful servant of the Lord, Paul, admonishes as follows: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The prophecy of Zephaniah contains instruction from Almighty God to those who would be wise and who would receive the Lord’s approval. In this issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> consideration is given to that prophecy, chapter one, verses five to thirteen. To aid one in the study of this prophecy a brief statement is here given as to what is contained in this issue: Jehovah warns of his purpose to clear out all things of Satan’s organization, and particularly all who remain in that organization after having been warned. The religious leaders and associate worshipers, who try to mix the things of God and the things of the Devil, will find no way of escape from God’s wrath. The “evil servant” class will find no way of escape. Only those who fully devote themselves to Jehovah and who remain faithful will be spared at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah warns that this is the time to listen to him, and particularly to his present-day message, because the day of sacrifice of the wicked is near. The Lord gives notice that he will punish the religious, political and commercial rulers, and all who identify themselves with religion and who pretend to represent or serve God. A great howl will go up from the principal ones of the religious flock; and also in this howl the political higher-ups, as well as the lower-down ones, will join, and all who have</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">heaped up treasure for the last days will suffer destruction of their treasures and themselves.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah causes his Word and name to be proclaimed throughout the earth, and by the light of his Word he searches out “Christendom”, and at Armageddon that which the worldly ones will rely upon will be suddenly taken away, to their great chagrin and disappointment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> In the preceding issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Zephaniah’s prophecy, chapter one, verses one to four, was considered. The prophecy continues : “And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops ; and them that worship and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham.” (Zeph. 1:5) In the day of King Manasseh the Israelites indulged in  demon-worship; that is, they practiced religion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font4"> Chron. 33: 1-6; 2 Ki. 21:1-5) Such devil-religion practice by the Israelites continued down into the reign of Josiah and even after his death. Attention was called to this practice of demonism by another prophet after the death of King Josiah. (Jer. 8:1, 2 ; 19:13) Jehovah had expressly commanded that his people should not indulge in demon-worship, such as that of stargazing or worship of the sun -and moon and like idolatrous practices. (Deut. 4: 15-19; 17:3) This divine rule applies at all times. The practice o: so-called “Christian religion” continues to violate this divine rule. Men who are designated by the people of the world as “great lights”, or shining ones, receive adoration, praise and worship, which belongs alone to Almighty God. There are great ecclesiastical “lights”, so called, who ‘have a show of godliness but deny the power thereof’. (2 Tim. 3:5) Men praise and serve them contrary to God’s Word. Jehovah God is the great Light, “dwelling in the light which no inan can approach unto.” (1 John 1:5; 1 Tim 6:16) Instead of worshiping the Almighty God humans indulge in the worship of creatures, which worship is an abomination in the sight of Jehovah. Men worship the state or corporate ruling power. They call the League of Nations “a great light” and give praise and worship to that abortive organization. (Rev. 13:14,15) Advocating the support, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">115</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">noted writer of the League of Nations, Incorporated, recently said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ “In a world as dark as this, why blow out the only light [League of Nations] there is!” In this manner the light of God is entirely ignored and all light attributed to men. Stargazers and creature-worship God declares he will completely cut off. Political dictators indulge in this kind of demonism, and hence their time is short, because the day of final reckoning approaches. It is Satan, the prince of demons, who has influenced the people to give their praise and worship to creatures and inanimate objects rather than to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> At the present time “Christendom” claims to serve the Airnighty God, but does the very opposite. They go through a formalism, which they call “worship”, to be seen of men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The prophecy then adds: “And them that worship and that swear by the Lord, and that swear by Malcham [their king-god (margin, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)].” </span><span class="font4">Malcham was the name of the chief idol of the Ammonites, who, in the type, foreshadowed the political element now indulging in religion and who employ religion in their rule of the nations of the earth. Such in ancient times was, and likewise now is, political worship. (1 Ki. 11:7,33; 2 Ki. 23: 13) The religious politicians in this present time swear by Malcham and God in the same breath.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> As the American Catholic leaders put it, they are “For God and country&quot;’. Such is an effort of the religionists to compromise by claiming to worship Jehovah God and the state at the same time. That is vainly seeking the name of Jehovah God and having his name upon their lips, while at the same time attributing salvation and protection to the state. Thus the religionists practice what they call “the Christian religion” and at the same time proclaim their political relationship with the governments of this world, of which Satan is the prince. The ecclesiastical and political powers exchange ambassadors and together carry on the politics of the land. They hail the state as supreme and speak of that which is the puny creation of man, “League of Nations,” as being “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. Also at the same time they teach that the political rulers are the “higher powers” and “ministers of God”. Thereby many persons are turned away from Almighty God and taught to serve creatures. Those who swear by the Lord, and by the political power at the same time, make mention of Jehovah God, but not in sincerity and in truth. This they do for effect upon the people, that the people may be kept in subjection to them and in ignorance of what God’s purpose is toward them. Concerning such Jehovah by his prophet says they “swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness”. (Isa. 48:1) All the religionists herein described God declares he will cut off.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Jehovah then considers that class of persons that are properly known as “quitters”, that is, those who have claimed to be servants of God and have induced themselves to believe thereafter that they have a good cause to withdraw from the service of the Lord: “And them that are turned back from [following after] the Lord; and those that have not sought the Lord, nor inquired for him.”—Zeph. 1: 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The Lord specifically names such class of persons as those who have covenanted to serve Jehovah and who then turn back from that service, and by the Lord these are called the “evil servant” or “wicked servant” class, which form a part of the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” and who oppose God, his government and his King. Such class turn to the wicked world and are opposers of The Theocracy and opposers of those who publish the name of Jehovah and his government. In striking contrast to the “evil servant” God foretold by his prophet a “remnant” that now serve him and who receive great persecution, and he puts these words into the mouth of his “faithful servant” class: “All this [reproach and persecution] is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way.” (Ps. 44:17,18) “Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. So will not we go back from thee; quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.”—Ps. 80: 17,18</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The religionists, the “evil servant”, the &quot;man of sin” class, have turned away from God; but the “faithful servant” class, although sorely persecuted by the religionists, remain faithful and do not turn back. God has made his faithful remnant class to clearly understand now- that religion is demonism; and when they suffer persecution at the hands of religionists, that does not prevent them from remaining faithful and true servants of the Most High. The faithful remnant, devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, are designated as purified ones, the “saints”, by virtue of their being in the temple with Christ Jesus. Concerning these it is written in the Psalms: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness; for God is judge himself. Selah.”—Ps. 50: 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> In 1918 Christ Jesus at the temple began the inspection of “Christendom”, which religious crowd have claimed to serve God but have not: and through his prophet he declares that these shall be cut off: “Those that have not sought the Lord, nor inquired for him.” (Zeph. 1:6) During the progress of Jehovah’s “strange work”, and before Armageddon, God sends his message to “Christendom” by his messengers to give them information and warning, and particularly to the leaders of “Christendom”, but such leaders and practitioners of religion refuse to hear or to seek after God, and put themselves in opposition to the Theocrat and his government. Although claiming to be Christians, they fully support Satan and his organization and manifest great pride in supporting the “corporate state”, always seeking the approval of such rather than to have the approval of God and his King. Being willingly against God and his government, such religionists are proud and arrogant and wicked. Concerning such Jehovah says: “The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek aftei God: God is not in all his thoughts.” (Ps. 10:2-4) Thus the prophet of God exactly describes the religious-political leaders of “Christendom”, all of which are against God and The Theocratic Government and the servants of that Government who now represent God on the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah sends his faithful servants to the proud religionists, and which witnesses call attention to the presence of the King, Christ Jesus, and that the day of his government is here; and his witnesses point out to them that the only hope of humankind is in The Theocracy, but such wicked ones completely ignore the admonition of Jehovah. Such obstinate class, although receiving the witness, refuse to give heed to the commandments of the Lord as set forth in Revelation 22:17. They do not seek righteousness and meekness; and the judgment of the Lord therefore written concerning such is that they shall be “cut off”. Those who seek Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government before Armageddon and remain faithful thereto are the only ones who find protection and safety.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Jehovah’s work, “his strange work,” is progressing. He is causing his servants on the earth to proclaim his great and holy name and his government. The nations of the earth “rage” in opposition to The Theocracy, and the people supporting them “imagine a vain thing”. (Ps. 2:1, 2) A great amount of talk is being made by the political, religious rulers of the earth who prognosticate, announcing that soon they will make the earth a fit place in which to live. Thus they set themselves against God and his government. The people who support those religious, political leaders vainly imagine that men who talk loud and boast of what they expect to do are able to bring about a desirable condition in the earth. The physical facts that now exist, and that are apparent to all persons who think, fully support the statement here that the rulers rage against Jehovah and his government, and that the people imagine a vain thing. To all such Jehovah by his prophet says: “Hold thy peace </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> Hush] at the presence of the Lord God; for the day of the Lord is at hand; for the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests.”—Zeph. 1: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Why are these commanded to hush and keep quiet! Because Jehovah, by his King Christ Jesus, is present and thus Jehovah is representatively sitting in judgment. All the world should now keep silent and hear what the Almighty God has to say. He spoke through his prophets long ago, and now he brings to pass the fulfillment of the prophecy. Jehovah now sends his witnesses among the people to speak his message, and thus the Lord Jesus by his servants is delivering the command to the people from the Most High to keep still and listen. All should keep silent, and not attempt to speak against Jehovah or against his message now, and thus to prevent others from hearing. The message of Jehovah to them is to cease spreading propaganda in support of Satan’s rule. Concerning this very time the Lord says through another of his prophets: “The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Hab. 2:20) “Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord; for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.”—Zech. 2:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Why was that command given through his prophet Zephaniah! and how does it apply in these modern days! The answer is, because now is the day of Jehovah God. The Almighty raised up Zephaniah his prophet and caused him to announce God’s purpose to destroy Jerusalem, which had become unfaithful; and which foreshadowed the destruction of the antitypical or hypocritical Jerusalem of today, that is to say, “Christendom,” which shall be destroyed at Armageddon. The notice of warning was given to ancient Jerusalem, and likewise a notice of warning is given to “Christendom” today, and all are commanded to be quiet and hear what Jehovah has to say to them. It appears that Zephaniah began to prophesy before the day when Josiah began to seek the Lord and to purge the country of idolatry, and from that time it was only a few years, that is, about forty years, until the destruction of Jerusalem took place; but at that time the exact date of Jerusalem’s destruction was not known by the prophet or others. In the thirteenth year of King Josiah’s reign Jehovah raised up, commissioned and sent forth his prophet Jeremiah, and in that thirteenth year was the beginning of the forty-year period of warning to Jerusalem. From that thirteenth year onward Jerusalem’s iniquity began to count, sealing her doom, as is declared in the prophecy of Ezekiel, to wit: “And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.” (Ezek. 4:6,7) The symbolic forty days or actual forty years in the antitype include the Catholic and other religionists and their practice. (For a more detailed discussion of this see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, pages 46-55.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> In the prophecy of Zephaniah the words “the day of the Lord is at hand” antitypically refer to the destruction of antitypical Jerusalem, that is, to the religious systems of the world and particularly “Christendom”. Therefore the command to all, including “Christendom”, is to cease the announcing and boastful prognostication and to give ear to what the Lord God has to say. The prophecy is therefore a warning to all the world and particularly to “Christendom”.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> Silence having been commanded, the prophetic words announce: “For the Lord hath prepared a sacrifice.” That means a great slaughter and the flowing of blood, which will take place at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. This prophecy is directed against religion and religionists. Another prophet of God tells of the great slaughter in these words: “And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree. For my sword shall be bathed in heaven [where the religionists perch themselves in the high rocks]: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. The sword of the Lord is filled with blood ; it is made fat with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for the Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.”—Isa. 34:4-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The declaration of the Lord concerning the great sacrifice, which is prepared, is also directed to and against that highly commercialized and political body in Satan’s organization, and is announced by another prophet in these words: “Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. . . . For this is the day of the Lord God of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries; and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood; for the Lord God of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.” (Jer. 46:2-10) Thus God discloses his purpose to destroy this class that have associated themselves with the religious teachers to turn the people away from God and his righteous government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The declaration of Jehovah’s purpose is then directed against the demons, all of which are under the command of Satan and under his chief prince, Gog, and concerning such the Lord says : “And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel. Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field, to be devoured.&quot; “And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God. Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood. And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.”—Ezek. 39: 2,4, 17, 19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> That great “sacrifice” or slaughter, which Jehovah has prepared, is described by the Lord Jesus at Revelation 19: 17-21: “And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; , . . And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah’s High Priest, Christ Jesus, does the slaughtering work, and this in vindication of Jehovah’s name. He offers an acceptable sacrifice before Jehovah, not of the bodies of the unclean, nor the bodies of creatures who are God’s enemies; but the “sacrifice” is the act of the great High Priest, Christ Jesus, in executing Jehovah’s commandment, the faithful performance of the duties assigned to him, and which slaughter work he does in vindication of Jehovah’s holy name. This will prove to all creation that Jehovah is the Supreme One.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> The tremendous and unparalleled events about to take place, and which are announced by the Lord, should be sufficient to cause all nations and peoples of the earth to cease their senseless prattle and to give ear to the warning that conies from the throne of the Most High. The day of God’s judgment and the vindication of his name is at hand. Many centuries ago the angelic host of heaven looked forward to these coming great events and they were announced by the faithful prophets of God on the earth. The great events are now about to come to pass. All creation, therefore, should stand in silence and hear the message of Jehovah concerning what is about to take place. That will be a slaughter such as never before was known and never again will come to pass.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> That great sacrifice is a holy service devoted exclusively to righteousness. To that great sacrifice the Lord bids his guests to come. “He hath bid his guests [he hath sanctified his guests (R.F.); hath hallowed his guests </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham')</span><span class="font4"> ].” Jehovah’s guests, or his called ones, he has invited in order that they may have a part in the vindication of his name. Those who are invited must come unto him with clean hands, that is, fully devoted to and in support of his King. Such participate in the sacrifice, that is, “eat the flesh of lungs,” by partaking of the joy of the Lord Jesus Christ in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. These guests have been called or invited to the kingdom service and now must devote themselves exclusively to that service in order to have a part in the vindication of his name. Those who are today devoted to Jehovah and his service can readily see how God caused his prophecy to be written long ago concerning that great sacrifice and brings about the facts in these modern days disclosing its fulfillment; all of -which he does that the “man of God” may be fully equipped to participate in the service and have part in his “strange work”, and thus have a part in the vindication of his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> Religion has been and is the chief thing employed by the demons, led by Satan, in defaming the name of Almighty God. The earthly leaders of religion, and particularly that religious institution which stands at the head, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are the chief ones on earth that defame the name of Almighty God. Hence these are the ones named as princes”, chief ruling ones, among the religionists on the earth. It appears from the prophecy that the daughter of the religionists comes first; and other prophecies fully support that conclusion. “And it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord’s sacrifice, that I will punish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font4"> visit upon] the princes, and the king’s children </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font4"> sons], and all such as are clothed with strange apparel [foreign apparel].”—Zeph. 1: 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> In this prophecy (verse eight) the words “in the day” mean at and during the actual battle of Armageddon, which takes place after or at the conclusion of God’s “strange work”, during which time this gospel of the kingdom has been preached to all the world for a witness’; and the time has arrived for the execution of the judgment of Jehovah upon Satan and his supporters. The punishment will fall upon the leaders, or ruling ones, of “Christendom”, that is, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, “whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth.” (Isa. 23:8; Ezek. 28: 2) Such are the.modern-day “princes of Tyre” described by God’s prophet. Concerning the unfaithful princes of “Christendom” it is written: “Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.” —Ezek. 22: 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> There could not be a more accurate description of the members of the “Hierarchy of Authority” than that given in this prophecy. The men of the Hierarchy, like wolves, devour the substance of others, shed innocent blood (as did Franco in Spain), and destroy souls for selfish gain. Who dares dispute the fact that religion is a racket? Those princes or great men of the Hierarchy have the reputation amongst others as the honorable men of the earth. (Isa. 23: 8) Mark how plainly God has described those religious racketeers who have rebelled against the Most High, spurned his Word, and who hold out their hands for gifts from the people and follow after dishonest gain, and who do so upon the false representation and pretext that they are God’s servants and that they can pray to God to relieve suffering human souls in “purgatory&quot;. Thus they deceive the credulous ones, blind them, and then rob them blind : “Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel. Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.”—Isa. 1: 23, 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Let this be considered: that the doctrine of “purgatory” has been taught only by that religious system, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and that, as stated by Cardinal Gibbons, himself a leading Catholic, the “purgatory” doctrine is based solely upon the tradition of the “fathers” of the Roman Catholic system. The language of Cardinal Gibbons concerning “purgatory” is: “It is the unanimous voice of the fathers of Christendom.” Such “fathers of Christendom”, the priestly class of the Roman religious company, have been the only ones that have induced the people to believe that the dead are in “purgatory’’; and this they have falsely done at the dictation of the Devil in order that they may get dishonest gam. which gain they receive by inducing the people to pay into their hands large sums of money. Is that a racket? Let the honest and sincere persons who have been duped by the Catholic system answer the question honestly before themselves and before Almighty God: Is it safe to follow such racketeers? Is it not time for all honest persons to seek instruction at the mouth of the Almighty and study to show themselves approved by him?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>50</sup> Almighty God foretold the acts and conduct of such religious princes that the people of good will at this day might see the snare into which religion.has led them and to afford such honest people an opportunity to flee from religion and seek refuge in the organization' of the Most High under Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> King Josiah had three sons and a grandson who, one after the other, succeeded to the throne of Israel, and each of them was unfaithful to God. They were removed from office by violence, and concerning them the prophet Zephaniah says: “I will punish . . . the king’s sons.” (Vs. 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> The religious leaders claim that they are the sons of God, but Jesus declares that they are the sons of the Devil. (John 8: 44) Such religious princes of the religious systems exercise spiritual rulership over the organization specifically called “the Christian religion”, and these are the princes the prophet describes that shall be punished at Armageddon. It is these religious princes that teach the people that their dead are in “purgatory” and which princes claim a royalty for looking after those whom they have claimed to be in “purgatory”. Such religious princes on earth are the direct representatives of the demons and under demon control, and are therefore the “sons” of the chief of the demons, that is, Satan, and these are the children of the Devil, or the sons of the Devil, that God declares he will punish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> There are those who openly identify themselves with the Devil’s organization, and these are designated or pictured by “such as are clothed with strange apparel” or “foreign apparel”. This scripture shows that they are not identified as God’s servants, but they are clothed in apparel showing themselves as foreigners to God’s organization and which apparel they wear is provided by the Devil, like the vestments worn by the princes of Baal when Jehi) slew them. (2 Ki. 10:22-25) Such men don the unii form that is strange or foreign to God and identify themselves as a part of Satan’s organization and as those who uphold it. Have in mind the unmanly, strange apparel worn by the princes or ministers or clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. When the message of God is presented to them they reply: “I am a minister; I am a priest; I want nothing from you.” The supporters of the Hierarchy, when the truth is presented to them, usually say: “I am satisfied with my religion.” The official apparel of the clergy or Hierarchy is very strange. It makes the wearers thereof very conspicuous amongst men, by which such wearers claim to be “more holy” than others. Now God, by his prophet and the evidence showing the fulfillment of the prophecy, makes known that the wearers of such strange apparel shall be completely punished at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘LEAPERS’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The destruction of religionists will not be limited to the so-called “Christian religion” practitioners, but all kinds of religion will be disposed of at Armageddon. This is clearly indicated by the prophecy: “In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.”—Zeph. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ In this verse of the prophecy the words “in the same day” mean in that day of Armageddon, which is now near. According to Rotherham’s rendering: “I will punish every one who leapeth over the threshold.” “Which fill their masters’ houses with violence and deceit.” The Devil is their master; therefore the house is the house of the Devil. He is the master of religion. It appears that the key to the meaning of the expression “leapeth over the threshold” is found at 1 Samuel 5:4,5: “And when they [the Philistines] arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon [the idol] and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold: only the stump of Dagon was left to him. Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> At the battle of Shiloh the Philistines defeated the Israelites, which defeat God permitted to come upon the Israelites because of their hypocrisy and unfaithfulness to their covenant. The priests and worshipers of Dagon, when they discovered that his head was broken off, did not tread upon but leaped over the threshold of Dagon’s house. The leapers, therefore, foreshadowed those who worship demons or practice demonism and who help to destroy the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and all other religions, and who then defy Jehovah God as the Supreme One and openly express their rebellion against Jehovah. Those demon-worshipers must be punished before the end of Armageddon, and God declares his purpose to punish them. Many of such have at some time tied themselves up with religion for political, business or professional gain or for social purposes. They then openly appear and fill the Devil's house with deceit and violence. There are only two masters that anyone can serve: Jehovah God and the Devil. These leapers serve the Devil, and they fill the Devil’s house with deceit and violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “That day” is Jehovah’s day, during which he executes his vengeance against the enemy and proves His own supremacy and makes an end of wickedness: “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.” (Zeph. 1:10) God himself will cause the evidence or facts to come to pass which are foretold by this prophecy. Now he makes known what he will do and tells that his work will be accompanied by a great noise: “the noise of a cry from the fish gate.” This gate is mentioned also at 2 Chronicles 33:14, Nehemiah 3:3, and Nehemiah 12:39. The men of Tyre, who were merchants, brought fish and sold them at the gate to the people of Jerusalem. (Neb. 13:16) Manifestly the cry mentioned by Zephaniah is not the cry of the fish-sellers to sell for gain, but a cry of dismay because of the spoiling of the traffic in which they were engaged. The agents of Satan by means of religion have fished for and made big hauls of men who, as poor fish, have because of fear gone right into the net provided for them by the Devil. At Armageddon all fishing of that kind must cease. Such fishermen deal treacherously, and by their religious bait attract and lead many peoples into captivity. (Hab. 1:14-17; Eccl. 9:12) After Armageddon religious leaders will no more be permitted to take men like fish into their nets. Their commercial religion being done, they shall utter a cry of despair and dismay. The boasting Roman Catholic rule will then cease for ever. Their racket will be completely done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Another class of religionist is mentioned as “howling from the second [quarter (R.F.)]”. This second quarter seems to picture that part of the organization of religionists second to the “Hierarchy of Authority”, that is, the principal ones of the flock, which class God declares shall howl. The “howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard”. (Jer. 25:34-36) This howling is because their dealing in human creatures is finished for ever. Such men have laid hold upon and used religion for commercial and political gain. They are the principal ones of the flock of the Roman Catholic organization. They will come to see that religion is entirely in vain, and they will howl and shriek because it can do them no more commercial good.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> The hills are the highest part of the mountains. (Ps. 2:6) In the Devil’s organization “the hills” represent the highest or lifted-up part of that organization on earth. Those of Satan’s organization who occupy the highest place in the earth will at the time of the battle of Armageddon be in such dismay that they will cry out for the organization to protect them, that is: “Cover us”; and “to the hills, Fall on us”<sup>-</sup>. (Hos. 10: 8) As stated by the prophecy of Zephaniah, there shall be “a great crashing [destruction] from the hills”. Armageddon will destroy all of those who occupy the high and exalted places in the world organization. Those higher-up ones in the commercial, political and military are usually austere and haughty; therefore says the scripture: “Before destruction the heart of man is haughty.” (Prov. 18:12) Such haughty ones who have relied on religion for insurance and on their wealth and position for protection shall be brought low. (Isa. 40:4;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Nahum 1:5; Hab. 3:6) The mountain of Jehovah’s house, The Theocracy, in that day shall be exalted above the mountains and hills of Satan’s organization. In the house or organization of Jehovah Gqd is the only place of safety, security and deliverance, and there is none other.—Isa. 2: 2-4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Among those who practice religion are those persons who are looking for commercial gain and use religion for that purpose, but who make no pretense of serving God or Christ. Concerning such the prophet says: “Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.” (Zeph. 1: 11) According to Young’s translation: “Ye inhabitants of the hollow place.” In this part of the prophecy is pictured the low place occupied by a commercial, materialistic class. They associate themselves with the religion of “Christendom” for purely commercial purposes or gain. The Lord says all such shall howl. The reason is that all merchant people are cut down, “all the people of Canaan” are cut down. (A.R.F.) In times of old the Canaanites had commercial relationship with the Israelites and were at Jerusalem when the Lord smote the city, and He did not spare the commercial business of the Canaanites. At Armageddon those who have used the so-called “Christian religion” for material gain shall be destroyed. (Jer. 25: 29) Further the prophet says: “All they that are laden with silver are cut off.” (Vs. 11, R.F.) Such have heaped up treasures for the last days, but have done so in vain. (Jas. 5:1-3) The wealth, represented by silver, cannot deliver them or obtain for them a ransom in the day of God’s wrath. (Ezek. 7:19; Zeph. 1:18) The Roman Catholic organization, ruled by the Hierarchy, have formed the most momentous, commercial organization on earth. The material riches of that organization are fabulous. They have piled up silver and gold and other material wealth or treasure while falsely claiming to serve God, and have obtained that treasure by false pretenses; hence they are cut off.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘““Christendom” is the antitype of ancient Jerusalem, which corrupted herself with demonism or religion. Such prefer darkness to light, and their desire is to keep the people in darkness as to what is God’s purpose and what is his provision for obedient men. Therefore, says the Lord by his prophet Zephaniah: “And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees; that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.”—Zeph. 1:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> God is light, and his Word is that which guides one in the right way. Light dispels darkness and makes known that which is in the dark, to clearly be seen. “The commandment is a lamp” to guide men. (Prov. 6:23; Ps. 119:105) In this day, when Jehovah is doing his “strange work”, he causes his lamp, that is, his Word, to plainly guide his servants. By the proclaiming of God's Word of truth among the people religion and the practice thereof are exposed to view and the people who are of good will learn the truth that religion is a snare and a racket, and they learn what is God's purpose toward them that obey him. God's light, therefore, discloses that religion practiced by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is concealed or hidden by lies and that such hiding place of lies will be swept away by the truth. (Isa. 28:15-18) The light of Jehovah causes the enemies of the Theocratic Government to be exposed, and hence the enemies are forced right out into the open. Thus the Lord searches out “Christendom''. During the period particularly from 1922 onward Jehovah has caused his faithful servants to carry about his Word of light, and that work has caused the religionists to show a great dislike for the Bible and its teachings, and also caused them to exhibit their anger against those who proclaim the Bible truths. The great Judge, Christ Jesus, at the temple is causing the division of the people, and doing so by using his servants to proclaim the truth exposing to view the “goats”, who are the enemies of God. Such searching out must continue until Armageddon. No dark places will be long unexamined or unexposed. “And though they hide themselves in the [wooded] top of Carmel, I will search and take them out.” (Amos 9: 3) “How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!” (Obadiah 6) “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.”—Ps. 21: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> When searched out the enemies will be punished: “Punish the men that are settled on their lees [dregs or settlings].” (Zeph. 1:12) The religionists, and the leaders particularly, appear to think that they are everlastingly fixed and that they are settled down, and have not, as the wine is, “been emptied from vessel to vessel.” These religionists have long been left undisturbed, and therefore their perverted taste remains in them and their scent is unchanged. (Jer. 48:11) The time has come when the Lord visits them and stirs them up, causing their vile and impure settlings to rise up and spoil the taste, and that upsets their “thickened” or hardened, self-complacent condition. This prophecy aptly describes the condition of the religious leaders, pictured like wine settling down. These leaders have settled on the lees of antiquity. Everything with them is hardened into immovable creeds and ceremonies, with made-to-order prayers and ceremonies, and in the collection of money for such prayers. They desire to stay right where they are, and object to having their religious susceptibilities disturbed. When the light of God’s Word is brought to their attention it disturbs them. This is particularly so when the truth is declared to the Catholic practitioners and interests the “children” of the organization who are of good will toward God. When the past history of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is made known in connection with the divine prophecy this greatly stirs up the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The light of truth really torments those religionists, and then God visits them with “his act, his strange act”, which means their destruction at Armageddon. The religious Hierarchy think themselves so secure that they say in the language of the prophet: “The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil” to us. Now they are being called to account by the Lord, who is causing his message to be delivered among them, yet they make themselves believe that they are so thoroughly fixed that they cannot be moved. They conclude that the Lord is satisfied with their course of action and will let them stay put, and will do no good to them, meaning that he will not improve their condition or the condition of the people to make them free from dictators, both religious and political; and that he will do them no evil, but let them stay where they are. Those religious racketeers say: We are on solid rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against us.’ (Matt. 16:18) Jehovah turns the light on them, and is doing that now. And when that is finished, then what?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> What today is the great ambition of religious and political leaders? To rule the earth arbitrarily; to control all the material wealth of the earth; to regiment the people and make them obey the will of a few selfish men, and for themselves to rest in a condition of ease. Such constitutes the material interest of the aforementioned rulers, that is to say, “their goods.” They have failed to give heed to the Word of Almighty God, but have readily yielded to the influence and power of the demons. They feel secure in what they have builded, and they boast of their power and wealth. To such Jehovah says: “Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation; they shall also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.”—Zeph. 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> Just at the time these crafty, religious and political rulers have gained control of the nations they say, “Now we have peace and safety.” Their accumulated, great wealth and power become a booty, that is, a prey, or that which is taken forcibly, or by violence. The wealth, power and position of the boastful combine above mentioned will now not be theirs for long to enjoy. “The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.”— Ps. 110:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> Jehovah’s host will suddenly snatch away from them their arbitrary rule and everything they have, and that to their great disappointment, chagrin and humiliation. Their dreams for ever shattered, they will know that the power of Jehovah God is being expressed against them. The Almighty turns them upside down by the hand of Christ Jesus, and these religious, political rulers will see that they are completely done for. “The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.” (Prov. 13: 22) “Their houses a desolation.” Their place of ease and of living wantonly does not last long. Their religious houses have long been filled with the “children” of the religious systems. Suddenly these children disappear, and no longer will their palatial church buildings be patronized. Their revenue is cut off. The places of exclusive dwelling for political, totalitarian rulers, and commercial bosses, will be quickly taken away. Just now it is seen that the ruling elements of the earth have built many houses, palaces, and cathedrals; and of them the Lord says: “They shall . . . build houses, but not inhabit them”; that is, they shall not control them, but their rule shall quickly end. An example is that of the dictator of Germany, who has repeatedly said: “We are building now that which will endure for a thousand years.” The Word of God shows that suddenly the bottom drops out of everything for all such rulers. All their work is wasted. Jesus prophesied that they would build right up until the very outbreak of Armageddon. (Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 17 : 26-30) That prophecy must be fulfilled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>46</sup> In all the totalitarian-ruled nations the dictator is now causing the people to yield to his selfish will as to what they may buy or sell or what they may do. Mark the rapid drift of events to that same end in the United States since 1933. All power is being concentrated within the hands of a few. The rulers, religious and political, think they are laying the foundation for an everlasting “good time”. Mark this also that such builders take all the credit to themselves and Jehovah God is not in their thoughts. They give to men, and particularly to themselves, all the credit for the building and for all the wealth and for all the prospects of the future. They boast of what the rulers shall soon do. Jehovah and his kingdom they do not take into account at all. They know not the day of their visitation.—Luke 19: 44 ; Jer. 8 : 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>47</sup> The year 1940 sees the fulfillment of the prophecy proving that all nations of the earth have forgotten the Almighty God and have turned entirely to religion, that is, to demonism. They have fallen completely into Satan's snare. The corporate state, ruled by dictators, takes away the liberties of the people, and the selfish rulers revel in what they have. But such rule will not long stand up. Jehovah’s “strange act” will mark the end of all such. Oppressive rule will increase, and at the same time the suffering of the people will increase. Only those who have devoted themselves to Almighty God, and who steadfastly support the great Theocratic Government, will find reason for rejoicing and will rejoice. (Hab. 3:17,18) While the faithful servants of God have great reproach heaped upon them, being hated by all nations, these faithful ones have their confidence fully anchored in the Lord and they, in the face of all opposition and persecution, continue to sing unto the Lord: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”—Ps. 13: 5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">God is the fountain of life: “For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.” (Ps. 36:9) That means that all life originates with Him, and none can have and enjoy life without his permission. No one can take life contrary to God’s expressed law and at the same time be exempt from responsibility. God’s “everlasting covenant” first mentioned is his emphatic declaration concerning the sanctity or sacredness of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A “covenant” is a binding agreement or promise to do or not to do a certain thing. Jehovah’s expressed purpose to do a certain thing is an unconditional or one-sided covenant. When Jehovah gives his word of promise he unconditionally binds himself to carry out that purpose. He declares : “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” “My word . . . shall not return unto me void ; but it shall accomplish that which I please ” (Isa 46 : 11; 55 : 11) A covenant made by Jehovah with one or more of his creatures is a bilateral or two-sided agreement to do certain things, and the other parties to the covenant must do the things mentioned Jehovah God always faithfully performs his part of his covenants. “Know therefore that Jehovah thy God, he is God, the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations.”—Deut. 7 : 9, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Almighty God, the creator of human life, brought the first world that had to do with man to an end by the great deluge, which destroyed all flesh upon the earth, including the mighty “men of renown” who were the offspring of the marriage of the angelic “sons of God” with the “daughters of men”. (Gen. 6: 4) The only survivors of that catastrophe were those in the ark which Noah had built at Jehovah’s command. 2 Peter 2:5 relates: “[God] spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.” Those who were destroyed were wicked and an abomination in the sight of Jehovah God. Following the flood the population of the earth consisted of Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, and the four other members of Noah’s household. Then Jehovah God restated to Noah and his sons the divine mandate originally given to Adam and Eve in Eden “And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.” “Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.” (Gen 9:1; 10:1) Over a thousand years previous Cain slew his righteous brother Abel, and Jehovah God said to Cain. “And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand. . . . Whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” “And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.” (Gen. 4:11,15) Thus no man could appoint himself as the executioner of the assassin Cain. But what now after the deluge?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the end of the great deluge Noah and his family went forth from the ark. Then it was that God declared to Noah the divine covenant concerning the shedding of blood, that is, concerning the sanctity of life. This covenant is called “the everlasting covenant” between God and living creatures, for the reason that that covenant is the expression of God’s purpose that He will never change. The statement of God’s everlasting covenant is found in the following: “And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him. saying, And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; and with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth : and I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud • and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you, and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”—Gen. 9: 8-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In connection with this “everlasting covenant” Jehovah God declared that under certain conditions and at certain times human life may be taken in the enforcement of God’s law. At verses five and six, preceding the above quotation. God said: “And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every [killer] beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.” This could not mean that any individual could appoint himself as the executioner of the wrongdoer; because the commandment of God is: “Thou shalt not kill.” (Ex. 20:13) At times God designates certain ones or bodies of men to act as his executioner to enforce his judgment against the wrongdoer. The “everlasting covenant” was stated to Noah at the time that Noah was righteous in the sight of God because of his faith and obedience toward God. and Noah was made God’s executioner of the murderer This establishes the rule that all execution of wrongdoers must be done in righteousness, that is to say, in harmony with God’s law. (Refer to Exodus 21:12-25, Leviticus 24:16-21.) The law of God designates only a few of the offenses for which human life shall be taken in harmony with the terms of the everlasting covenant To take human life contrary to God’s appointed way is therefore a violation of the everlasting covenant. The Scriptures and the indisputable facts show that today the earth is defiled because the inhabitants thereof have “broken the everlasting covenant” (Isa. 24:5), but the chief religious head in “Christendom” bestows his “Apostolic blessing”, and that “with affectionate sentiments”, upon slaughter of the innocents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The words of God, at Genesis 9:5,6, in connection with the establishment of the everlasting covenant, constitute an emphatic statement of the fact that Jehovah God alone has the right to give life and the right to take it away and. if life is taken by man, this taking of life must be done strictly in accord with God’s law, and that law applies to both man and beast The decree which God announced to Noah was to this effect: “Ye shall not suffer a murderer to Ine &quot;&nbsp;That decree is not contrary to God’s law “Thou shalt not kill”, but is in exact harmony therewith. The individual who assumes the right to kill his fellow man is a murderer, and hence a breaker of God’s law. God’s decree is that the manslayer shall be punished by death, which sentence must be executed by duly constituted authority The Lord’s words “whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man” could hardly refer back to the creation of Adam in the image and likeness of God. Rather those words mean that the duly constituted executioner of the wrongdoer acts as the representative of God and in so doing man acts “in the image of God”, that is, such executioner acts on the authority delegated to him by the Lord in executing the manslayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Certainly no one who is in a covenant to do God’s will desires to break his covenant concerning the sanctity of life; but, on the contrary, he is diligent to avoid all such offense. But there are those who are “without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">worthy’ of death,</span><span class="font2"> not only do the same, but have pleasure in them [or, according to the marginal reading, consent with them] that do them [as religion has consented with bloodguilty revolutionaries]”.—Rom. 1:31,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The nations called “Christendom” are in an implied covenant to obey God’s law, because these nations claim to be Christian and to take the Bible as their guide. Having God’s word and claiming to believe it, the obligation upon them is to learn the will of God as set forth in his Word and then do it. Instead of so doing, every nation of “Christendom” has willfully broken the everlasting covenant with reference to both man and beast. In the commission of that great sin Nimrod “the mighty hunter” took the lead among men after the flood. He did everything possible within his power to defy the Almighty God, and such proves that he was the instrument of the Devil. He became a great hero among the people because he was a killer. When he had done that he organized a religion and induced the people to practice that religion by adulating and serving men as a reproach to God’s holy name. Almost all killers practice some kind of religion. The two seem to go together. This is particularly true with those who after committing a crime hasten to the priest and make confession in order that they might receive absolution and forgiveness. At least, they are induced to believe that a priest can absolve them; which, of course, he cannot do. To kill is a great crime and Violation of God’s law, and the practice of religion is likewise a great crime and a reproach to the name of Almighty God. Religion is a lie, because by religion men are wrongfully led to worship creatures or things as though such were god Religion results in murder, because those who knowingly and willfully induce men to practice religion induce ’Ihem to practice that which leads to death. The Devil is the author of religion and is a murderer, and for this reason Jesus said of him: “He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. . . he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Satan’s religious, political, commercial organization on the earth has willfully and deliberately broken the everlasting covenant by wantonly and cruelly killing human creatures and dumb animals or beasts. God by his prophet (Isaiah 24:5,6) declares his purpose to destroy Satan’s official organization on the earth because of the violation of the everlasting covenant: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws [of God], changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The commercial and political elements of Satan’s visible organization have deliberately planned and promoted cruel wars resulting in the wholesale shedding of innocent human blood. The religious element of “Christendom”, and particularly the clergy, have sanctified those wars and blasphemously declared them to be in harmony with God’s will. All such willful slayers shall perish at Armageddon at the hand of Jehovah’s great Executioner, “the Son of man,” Christ Jesus, earth’s new and rightful King. On the other hand there are those on the earth, and particularly in the realm of “Christendom”, who have worked for and supported the commercial and political systems of oppression; who have served in the armies and navies and have taken human life; have upheld the commercial and political systems that have greatly oppressed the people, have associated with religious systems which have sanctified war and have hence been a party to the crime of breaking the everlasting covenant; and others who, as members of the “strong-arm squad”, have aided in the persecution of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and have persecuted those who serve God. During the World War many men participated in these wrongful doings, and especially in the persecution of God’s people, and did so without malice and without knowledge that they were violating God’s law Nineteen centuries ago the ruling elements in the nation of Israel were guilty of just such wicked things, and to them Jesus said that they had done such things “that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation”. (Matt. 23:35,36) The bloodguilty of the official element of the nation of Israel that winked at and oppressed and killed the witnesses and servants of God in particular, and that oppressed and killed the defenseless people in general, were visited by God’s vengeance That terrible punishment came upon Israel within a few years after the crucifixion of Jesus. Warning of that approaching trouble, Peter, filled with the spirit of God, said to the Israelites: “Save yourselves from this untoward generation.&quot;—Acts 2: 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The gross and flagrant violation of the everlasting covenant by the shedding of human blood must now be avenged, because this is the day of the vengeance of our God and the bloodguilty ones must fall by the hand of the great Executioner. Therefore the Devil “knoweth that he hath but a short time” (Rev. 12:12), and that soon the battle of the great day of God Almighty will be fought. Such will result in the meting out of justice to the murderers and in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Those who have unwittingly been associated with the devilish work against mankind, and in the heaping of infamy upon the name of Jehovah, and who would now escape to the place of safety which Jehovah God has provided and which was foreshadowed by the “cities of refuge” established among the Israelites, must hasten thereto. Such refugees must get away from the Devil’s organization and take their place with the Lord’s organization and remain there.—Numbers 35: 8-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For centuries the whole world has been under the dominating control of the wicked one, Satan, and his cruel and wicked organization. Not later than Armageddon Jesus Christ, the Revenger of blood wickedly shed, will slay the malicious clergy and their allies. It appears that such men, who have professed to serve God but who have willfully served the Devil, shall receive the severer punishment at the hands of the great Executioner. At Ezekiel 9: 5, 6 the plain declaration of the Lord is that “organized religion”, which has so greatly defamed his name, and those therein who have participated in the persecution of Jehovah’s faithful people and defamed his name shall be destroyed without mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Who, then, are the ones that will escape? It is the “great multitude” of people of good will toward God that flee into the Lord’s “city of refuge”. They were once associated in some respect with Satan’s organization, but now, by reason of learning of the wickedness thereof, and of God’s loving-kindness, they seek refuge in God’s organization, which organization was pictured by the ancient “cities of refuge” in Israel. They forsake Babylon, that is to say, Satan’s organization, and flee unto God’s organization, taking their stand on the side of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government under Christ. Henceforth they must have no sympathy with or give support to the wicked organization, but must remain steadfastly on the side of the great Theocrat Jehovah and be in full sympathy with his organization and the work” He is doing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>IS “CHRISTENDOM” WORSE THAN SODOM?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH GOD put his name in Jerusalem, after King David moved his capital there and transferred the sacred ark of the covenant to Mount Zion. Its people he provided with his law defining sin; and by comparison between those that received the law and those not having it he shows that ‘by reason of the law sin became exceedingly sinful'. As it is written: “I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” By giving his law to Jerusalem God made known the exceeding sinfulness of sin, but Jerusalem went ahead in its wickedness nevertheless. (Rom. 7:7-14) Not by a creature’s observation of sin, but by knowing the law of God and doing it, he learns the needed instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To self-righteous Jerusalem, and particularly her piousfaced clergy elders and leaders, it must have been a shock and jolt at the instance of the faithful prophet Ezekiel to have the notorious heathen Sodom called her “sister”, and then to be told that she, Jerusalem, was worse than Sodom</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jerusalem then and “Christendom” now have failed to learn Concerning them Jehovah by his prophet said: “As I live, saith the Lord God, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.” (Ezek. 16:48,49; Jer. 3: 6, 8, 10,14) Sodom represented the nations of the earth which are called “heathen”, while Jerusalem represented what is called “Christendom”. Immorality, debauchery, pride and idleness that prevailed in Sodom well apply to all the heathen nations. Sodom was a part of Satan’s organization, entirely under his control, and knew not Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same is true of all heathen nations of today. The peoples of Sodom were exceedingly bad; but they did not know better, because they had not been instructed. The Jews, being God’s covenant people to whom were given the law and the prophets, knew better, and therefore their abominations were far worse than those of the Sodomites. This is made clear by the words of Jesus: “And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell; for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.” (Matt. 11:23,24) Jehovah was justified in destroying the Sodomites because of their devilish practices. The rulers in Sodom, were-proud, well fed, idle, and made no proper provision for the-poor. “And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.”—Ezek. 16: 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the same rule of comparison “Christendom” today is far worse and more reprehensible than the Jews, tin Sodomites or the heathen. The rulers in “Christendom” are proud, haughty, austere and harsh. Among those who rule are the idle rich, who live riotously. The food which they use, and the things that are employed for their pleasure, they have never bestowed upon such one ounce of their labor. They live upon the fruits of the labor of others. The ultrarich own and control the nations of “Christendom” They support the clergy of the church organizations, who in turn attempt to absolve the rulers or ruling rich from all future responsibility. They pay the clergy well, of course but get nothing therefor, in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among nations a striking example is the United States It is the leading and most powerful and richest nation m all “Christendom”. Its natural resources are fabulous, and the riches possessed by the few who control it far exceed the riches of Solomon in the heyday of his glory. Those who possess the riches of the nation made it not by honest laborious efforts on their part, but they have acquired it by smart and cunning manipulation and by defrauding the people. The common people have bestowed their labor upon* the materials which God provided for man, in order that wealth might be produced, and the few selfish ones now possess the results of those labors of the common people</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the United States at present there is great distress There are millions of idle people, not seeking charity, but crying for an opportunity to work that they might ‘eat their own bread in the sweat of their face’. The ultrarich and selfish control the public press and the ruling powers of the land. In answer to the cries of the poor these say. ‘There is now an over-production, there is too much foodstuff and too much material for clothing, and you must not work until the present supply is used up.’ The rich live in ease and with fullness of bread and in abundance of idleness, while the poor who are idle sicken and die for want of food When some in the councils of the nation, feeling duty-bound to aid the suffering, attempted to appropriate funds to feed the starving poor, Big Business said, “No.” The commercial power, in fact, dominates and controls the political rulers, and the latter bow assent to the order from Big Business, and the clergy say, ‘This is a Christian nation , and what it decides the people must agree to, because such is correct, for the reason that it is a government by divine right.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are some men in political offices that are of tendei heart and have compassion upon the poor and an honest desire to help them. When millions of people in the United States were actually starving, an attempt was made by such men in the Congress of the United States to appropriate money to fed the poor and starving; but the whip from the executive was brought to bear upon the political pullers of the chariot, and the measure was voted down. Then a makeshift was brought forth and enacted into a law which really adds insult to injury. A large appropriation of money was voted and made available as a loan to feed the poor and starving </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">provided </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the poor and starving furnish the required security for the loan.</span><span class="font2"> If men are so poor that they and their children are actually starving, then manifestly they are too poor to furnish security for the loan of money with which to buy food. Briefly, the law means that, if those in need can furnish security for a loan of money, they may eat and live; but if not, then they must starve and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A United States senator, in giving his reason for refusing to support the above-mentioned measure, said: “I cannot vote for a proposition which embodies, as a matter of policy, the theory that only those who have security are entitled to live. The Congress . . . purports to turn its back on the sick and the dying without giving them any relief whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another senator denounced as infamous the policy of the United States to furnish aid only to those who can give security. A loan, as a rule, implies that interest must be paid. The United States, by claiming that it is a Christian nation, makes all of its citizens brothers, and the preachers boldly claim such brotherhood. By its own claim the law of God is binding upon the United States, to wit: “Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother.” (Deut. 23-19) The farmers and laborers of the land produced the wealth, and Big Business acquired it by manipulation, and also controls the political policy; and by what law or reason or justice should the starving men who produced the wealth be required to give security for a loan to get something to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is the laborers in the fields that are today crying in vain for bread. The vast continuing army of the unemployed, would-be laborers, also cries for bread. Big Business and big politicians turn a deaf ear to the cries of distress, but Jehovah hears the cries of the oppressed. He now serves notice upon the oppressors in these words- “Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, cneth , and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton, ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.” (Jas. 5:4-6) The poor is pushed aside, and resists not because he cannot; but the God of justice will fight his battle for him. The prophecy of Ezekiel, supported by other scriptures of the Bible, shows that the punishment that God will inflict upon “Christendom”, and particularly upon such nations as the United States, will be far greater than that which befell Sodom and which later came upon Jerusalem. Notice of these truths set forth in God’s Word must be served and has been served upon the rulers and the people of the United States and other nations by those witnesses whom God has anointed to do this work.—Isa. 61:1-3; Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Samaria, the city built by the wicked king Omri at the site he purchased, was the capital of the ten tribes of Israel. There the Devil religion was established, and Samaria became notorious for its idolatry. (1 Ki. 16:32,33; Hos. 7: 1-8) But the sins of Jerusalem were, because of her special privileges and advantages, far worse than those of Samaria, as Jehovah declared. “Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.” (Ezek. 16: 51) Because of the greater enormity of Jerusalem's sms. greater was her punishment; and thus Jehovah establishes his fixed rule which applies to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As there were two general divisions of the Israelites, even so there are two general divisions of “Christendom”, to wit, Catholic and Protestant. Samaria representatively pictured Catholicism, while Jerusalem more specifically applies to Protestantism, or the Protestant part of “Christendom”. Today ‘the two-horned beast’, the British-American imperial world power (Rev. 13:11-14), is the great bulwark of Protestantism. It is also the seventh world power, pictured by the seventh head of the beast that came up out of the sea. (Rev. 13: 1-3) The preceding world powers, except Rome, were heathen, like Sodom. Rome in its later days embraced the Catholic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rome is now a part of “Christendom”, and the major portion of the people in the confines of “Christendom” are Catholic. England and America, being the stronghold of Protestantism, or the Protestant branch of •‘Christendom”, are therefore more reprehensible before Almighty God. and subject to greater punishment, because of the greater opportunity to know God and learn of his kingdom The modernist clergymen thereof have turned to idol worship, they deny that God created man perfect, that he fell by reason of sin, and that redemption is provided by the blood of Jesus Christ; and deny the kingdom of God as the means provided for the uplift and blessing of the people and, above all, for the vindication of Jehovah’s name Like the powers of Samaria, Catholicism is an abomination in the sight of God. Even the Protestant wing of “Christendom” has harshly judged the Catholic population, and yet, judged according to the superior advantages, privileges and opportunities abused, neglected, or spurned, the Protestants arc even more abominable in the sight of Almighty God than Catholics, and this is proved by His words at Ezekiel 16.52- “Thou [Jerusalem] also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame, for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou; yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The deeper instruction here shown is this that in proportion to light, or opportunity of gaining light, so great is the responsibility; and that those who live under more favorable conditions and are favored with more light upon the Word of Almighty God, and who then become lawless, are more reprehensible before God and subject to the greater punishment. According to this rule, therefore, the Catholic branch of “Christendom” is an abomination in the sight of God, and the Protestant branch of “Christendom” is more abominable because of its greater light and opportunity According to the same rule, those in these latter days, whether Catholic or Protestant,-who have received a knowledge of the truth and embraced it and learned of God’s kingdom, and who have then become lawless, are even more reprehensible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“He would not be able to get a book. So I asked if he would like to hear an interesting lecture on the Bible. I set up the phonograph and played ‘Victory’. As soon as I started he sent to call his neighbor. The poor man was so hungry for the truth that when he sat down I had to watch steadfastly to see if he had fainted. After I had finished he told me: ‘My dear lady, you have given me something I never got in all my life.’ Asked me to call back, took the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and asked me to wait until I call again and he would give me the money. I called two days ago and gave him the other part of ‘Victory’. He said: ‘Lady, I wish I was in town where you are.’ I told him: ‘Don’t need to be. Arrange with me and I will set up a Bible class in your home with your family.’ He is living very far in the country, but where good work is to be done it can’t be too far for one. I have visited the leprosy asylum, and the sick people were very glad. I paid two visits already, and they try not to let them off. So I am going to ask the keeper if I can set up a Bible class for them.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A FOLDER DID IT</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Before I got around the block a man accosted me on the street: ‘You are the man with the Bible books, aren’t you?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ ‘You were on my street a few days ago. I read the little slip you gave me [-Enemies slip] and liked it very much. Let me see some of those books.’ He took </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Face the Facts,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font2"> and went on his way rejoicing. I went and did likewise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">80 YEARS OLD, BUT RISING UP AGAINST RELIGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“This octogenarian, who exceeds 60 hours a month in field service regularly, received a haughty reception at the hands of an irate housewife who had a distasteful impression of Jehovah’s witnesses. ‘I am a Catholic, and you people criticize our religion. You were around here last week, and I told you I did not want any of that stuff I’ ‘Madam, if you will read this booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> I’ll give it to you. It will explain everything. Read it right away. I'll be working in this block if you want to find me.’ About an hour later he was called while preparing to enter another house. It was the same woman, who this time had quite a different story to tell: ‘I have been turning you people down every time, even though I did not have any idea what your work was about. I want those three books you have there Stop back to see me in about two weeks; by that time I’ll have them read and will probably want some others ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">STARTED AND CONDUCTED HIS OWN FAMILY STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We called Sunday morning to invite him to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> study. He asked us in, saying, ‘We are just having a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses.’ On entering we found the family of five seated around the room, one with the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font2"> and the others with their Bibles This man had been reading the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> books for years, but said that just recently he had come to the conclusion that he must take a definite stand for the Lord. He was a Sunday school superintendent and had always used the books in his classes. We pointed out to him how he could have a small share in this work. He replied: ‘I don’t want a small share I’m going to have a big share in this work.’ A study was arranged for Wednesday night and there were twenty in attendance. A young Spanish woman came to our service meeting A publisher had given her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font2"> She said ‘I never read anything so wonderful in my life I’m going to have a part in this work.’ A Model Study has been arranged for next week for her father, mother and sister She is going with us in the field this coming Sunday and says she can go out every day in the week&quot;. Her mother wants a phonograph to play for their Spanish friends ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">DEBUNKING THE XMAS IDOL IN VANCOUVER, B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“We debated whether to try witnessing on ‘Christmas' day or to hide out until the orgy was past. We decided to go, and started for a logging camp. Found it entirely deserted except for a few stragglers who could not or would not join in the general spree. Among them we found those who were hungry for truth. We left eight bound books, 51 booklets, took five </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> subscriptions and placed a full set of records ‘Government and Peace’ with three additional records (single discs) with a man who was literally overjoyed with our visit. Who says ‘Xmas’ is a poor time to witness? Get out and try it yourself'”</span></p>
