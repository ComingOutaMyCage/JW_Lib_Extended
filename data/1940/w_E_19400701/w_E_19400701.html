<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This midsummer testimony period during the entire month of August follows closely the Theocratic convention at Columbus The period being named “Religion’s Doom”, the testimony activities should receive particular stimulation from the convention’s nationwide public address on “Religion as a World Remedy”. Appropriately, therefore, all Kingdom publishers will offer to the public, on a 25c contribution, the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and a self-covered booklet, preferably the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees,</span><span class="font4"> if the territory has recently been intensively witnessed to with the latest book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. </span><span class="font4">Conventioners and people of good will everywhere are invited to share in this testimony. Arrange for this now through the local organized company of Jehovah’s witnesses. If not yet associated with such, write us for references. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> supplies full details. A complete report on each publisher’s field service for August should be submitted, to compile the total results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The annual vacation period of the members of the Bethel family at Brooklyn this year is from Saturday, July 20, to Sunday, August 4, inclusive.

The normal operations of the factory and office will be suspended for that period; no books will be shipped or regular mail answered. Hence all field publishers should order sufficiently in advance that their supplies of literature to carry them through the vacation period and to the end of August maj be shipped out not later than the evening of Friday, July 19 Also reserve your correspondence with the factory and office until after Monday, August 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC CONVENTION OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The manifest leadings of the Lord indicate that all lovers of the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God should assemble in general convention in 1940. Columbus, Ohio, has been selected as the key city for a five-day convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 7</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Ezek. 18:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH thus states what shall be the result of his final judgment. He gives warning to the wicked which they must hear just before the execution of his judgment at Armageddon. He also assures the faithful ones who have been diligent in seeking righteousness and meekness that his favor shall be upon them. Jehovah has no pleasure in the death of the wicked. It would please God if the wicked would turn from their wickedness and live. Not doing this, they must meet the conditions of the final judgment, for the reason that he is not changeable. (Mal. 3: 6) Justice is the foundation of his throne, and justice shall be administered. The final warning, therefore, is given in kindness of Jehovah to the end that those who have been deceived by the demons and led in the wrong way might have an opportunity to escape. He assures those who have devoted themselves wholly to him that they may live. In brief, this issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> gives consideration to that part of the prophecy of Zephaniah, chapter three, verses 8 to 13. Jehovah bids ‘‘Christendom” and all her allies who have acted so contemptuously toward him to wait for him to act, and which act of Jehovah God will be his final answer to their boastful defiance of Jehovah. He vill then rise up to execute justice; and his justice being symbolized by a lion, he will go after the doomed prey and thereby give witness to all creation, and for all time, that the Almighty is Jehovah God and that his power shall be exercised against lawlessness in wiping out all wickedness. Jehovah first completes his “strange work”, and when he has maneuvered all the nations, and especially the so-called “Christian religious world”, into a proper position, including those who call themselves the &quot;Christian front”, the final showdown will take place. The enemies of Thu Theocracy in boastful defiance openly and without disguise carry into action their conspiracy to rule the world contrary to Jehovah’s appointed way. Thus they arouse Jehovah’s indignation and fierce anger, and he then, with zeal for his government of righteousness and his glorious name, begins his “strange act”. At Armageddon Jehovah will, by his Executioner, Christ Jesus, devour completely Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> The preparation for this great and final event against the demons and their dupes began immediately upon the Lord’s coming to the temple in A.D. 1918. He then began to equip his faithful “remnant”, designating the same the “faithful and wise servant”, and sends them forth as his witnesses to proclaim his purpose and to gather unto himself his “other sheep”, the “great multitude”. These gathered to him participate with the remnant in proclaiming The Theocratic Government in vindication of God’s holy name. This he does by giving to them a “pure language” that they without fear of men or demons may go forward and vigorously tell the good news of The Theocratic Government to the people, that the day for vindication of Jehovah’s great name has come and that he has set up his government of righteousness, which shall render justice and blessings m particular to those who obey his Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> In his preparation for the exhibition of his supreme power the Lord gathers his faithful people from many nations. The “remnant” come supplicating Jehovah and offering unto him their praise and service in righteousness. Modern-day Ethiopians, pictured by Ebed-melech, come to the remnant and join in the praise of Jehovah. The Lord God removes all cause for shame and fear on the part of these faithful servants by clearing out from them the proud, the character-developers, the creature-worshipers, and the devotees to religion. The faithful servants completely renounce religion or demonism. Under the direction of Christ Jesus the King they go forth proclaiming The Theocratic Government. In this they slack not the hand, but go on courageously until the “strange work” is completed and the “strange act” begins.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S ANSWER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Religionists who lead in “Christendom” boast of their greatness and goodness and defy the Almighty God. “Christendom” claims to be safe from all harm.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“Christendom” and allies claim the right to rule the world, and this in defiance of the Most High. To those boastful enemies Jehovah says: “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.”—Zeph. 3: 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> Here the Most High is telling “Christendom” and all others of Satan’s organization to “wait” for just a short time and then all the enemies shall get what is justly coming to them. Then no longer will the execution of judgment be delayed. “Whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their [destruction] slumbereth not.” (2 Pet. 2:3; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font7"> The end of all demons and of all earthly agents of demons has come, and judgment shall be executed quickly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">• According to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font7"> this text (Zeph. 3: 8) reads: “Wait ye for me, saith the Lord.” “Christendom” and others of God’s enemies, by the course of action taken, have defiantly challenged the Almighty God to take action, and this they have done as though God did not exist or as though he were impotent and had not the power to carry out his expressed will. The indisputable facts are that “Christendom” and her allies have willfully and deliberately disobeyed the commandments of Almighty God and continue to defy him. He acts in his own due time. To that boastful challenge and rebellious conduct the Lord God replies through another prophet: “Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light. Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.” (Amos 5:18, 23, 24) Thus Jehovah warns of his purpose to act, and he will act in his own due time. The hour for Jehovah to strike has not yet arrived; hence he says to the enemy: ‘Just you wait until my time to act, and then you will change your boastful cockiness, when you fully know that Jehovah is the Most High and the all-powerful, almighty God.’ Jehovah is self-contained, and he depends on nothing, and he acts when he gets ready to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>r</sup> Wait how long? ‘Until that day’; which they will know only when sudden destruction is upon them. Concerning the same matter Jesus says: “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. But as the days of No'e were, so shall also the coining of the Son of man [the Executioner at Armageddon] be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”—Matt. 24:36-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> The enemy did not know the day that the Lord would strike them down; but Noah did know, to wit, ‘seven days from the day he was told to enter with his family and animals into the ark.’ (Gen. 7:1-10) Noah, entering into the ark, was, however, a sign to the enemy that the day and hour was very nigh. Likewise the present day, with all the physical facts flung world-wide, shows that conditions existing in Noah’s day were similar to those which now exist upon the earth. All may see that the hurrying of the people of good will now to God’s organization is an indisputable sign and proves that the day of Jehovah's wrath upon all of Satan’s organization is due to strike very shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ Many times Jehovah has declared his purpose to destroy enemy organizations. The time must come when he exercises that power to accomplish his purpose. Therefore all the enemies, all of the Devil's organization, all that constitute a prey or booty, will be taken by violence exercised by Christ Jesus, the representative of Jehovah God. For this hour of execution Jehovah bids the enemy to wait for Him, for then, says he, ‘I will rise up to the prey’; that is, to make an attack and take the spoil. Why will Jehovah bring on such destructive results* ’To make himself an everlasting name.’ A picture of such great result was made when Jehovah led the Israelites out of Egypt by the hand of Moses and at the lied sea divided the waters thereof and caused his people to cross over on dry land and then engulfed the Egyptian army in the waters and destroyed them. That was a great miracle performed, showing the supreme power of Jehovah God, and the purpose announced by the Lord himself was, “to make thyself a glorious name.”—Isa. 63:12,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>10</sup> Other versions of Zephaniah’s prophecy read: “Wait . . . until the day when I rise up as [a] witness.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham; Septuagint,</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Syriac)</span><span class="font7"> For some time Jehovah has sent forth his witnesses to declare his name; and this work is his “strange work”, in which these witnesses have a part. When his witnesses have completed the work committed to them, then Jehovah will perform his “strange act”. (Isa. 28: 21) That rising up was also pictured by the battles of Perazim and Gibeon. That rising up in those battles was a witness to Jehovah's name and served notice upon the enemies. God’s “strange work&quot; is now about completed and the time for his “strange act” is about to begin. These prophetic statements are exactly in harmony with Jehovah’s declaration to Satan concerning His purpose, to wit: ‘For this cause have I permitted thee to remain, that I might show thee my power, and that my name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.’ (Ex. 9:16) Armageddon will be a time of the exhibition of Jehovah’s supreme power and will be such a complete witness to all creation that none can have any doubt about the fact that Jehovah is acting. Religion and religionists have completely rejected Jehovah's name and his kingdom, but the express purpose of the Most High is that all shall know that he is the Supreme One, “whose name alone is Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>X1</sup> When Armageddon begins and after the Most High rises up to the prey, those who are of Zion and who have maintained their integrity toward God will be safe. Concerning this the prophet of Jehovah says: “For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king; he will save us. Thy tacklings are loosed [that is, the commercial religionists are cut loose so there is no more religious commercialism] ; they could not well strengthen their mast; they could not spread the sail; then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame [that is, those who have appeared lame, Christ Jesus and his faithful followers, the ‘bruised reed’ class of The Christ] take the prey. And the inhabitant [that is, those of Zion who have proved their integrity] shall not say, 1 am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” (Isa. 33:22-24) All the world will realize then that Almighty God is backing up his people, that his everlasting arms are beneath them, and that his strength is exercised in their behalf. (Deut. 33:27; 2 Chron. 16:9) The faithful with Christ Jesus will then rejoice with fullness of joy because they shall witness the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Referring to the above prophecy of Isaiah: “The people that dwell therein [in Zion] shall be forgiven their iniquity [lawlessness]” means that the lawlessness of Zion, because of fear or otherwise, faults committed in 1918, have been forgiven. The Lord evidences this forgiveness, and from and after 1922 particularly the joy of the faithful ones has increased and reaches its fullness at the execution of Jehovah’s “strange act&quot;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>12</sup> The judgment of Jehovah does not change. He having entered his judgments of record, they stand for ever. Referring again to Zephaniah 3: 8, note that the Most High says: “For my determination is to gather the nations.” The word “determination” here used means “judgment rendered”. He entered his judgment long ago that the nations must be gathered, and since the coming of Christ to the temple in 1918 “the goats” are gathered together into a common corral and into united opposition to The Theocratic Government and to the message that God sends forth by his witnesses to be delivered. The judgment of Jehovah is that the nations shall be gathered to Armageddon. That judgment executed means not one nation will be omitted. He then adds the purpose of his gathering them, saying: “That I may assemble the kingdoms.” These nations and kingdoms mean those to whom Jehovah has said: “Wait ye upon me,” or, “Wait ye for me.” That means that not one of such nations or kingdoms shall escape and that the “nation” of “Christendom”, with all the elements that go to make up the same, will be handled just like the others, only “Christendom”, having practiced more fraud and deception, will bear a greater degree of punishment, if possible. “Christendom'’ has had no excuse to line up against The Theocratic Government, but has done so, and must drink the bitterness of the cup poured for her.—Jer. 25:15-29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>13</sup> Among the many nations, all of whom are assembled, there are some people of good will toward God. The nation or kingdoms as a whole, Jehovah shows, are not worthy of saving; only those individuals under such nations who show their good will toward Jehovah and who Hee to his organization, the antitypical “city of refuge”, can hope to be saved. “Christendom” claims to be serving Jehovah God; but she is not. At Armageddon the Lord will prove what “Christendom” really is, and all survivors will forever look upon “Christendom” with contempt. All will then see and fully appreciate that religion is a fraud and snare and a racket and the defamation of God’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIGNATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>14</sup> Why has Jehovah determined to “assemble the kingdoms”? He answers: “To pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger.” This language proves conclusively that the gathering and assembling of the nations means that all such are against The Theocratic Government; otherwise there would be no reason for God’s showing his indignation against them. Jehovah has all such in derision, and hence he gives them warning as stated in Zephaniah 2: 2, 3. At the same time Jehovah warns all those who are of good will toward him to flee from the enemy organization and to seek the Lord: “Behold, the day of the Lord conieth, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.” (Isa. 13: 9-13) “My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord.”—Jer. 51: 45.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1S</sup> Then adds Jehovah by his prophet: “For all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” (Zeph. 3:8) “The earth” consists of the visible part of Satan’s world organization, of which “Christendom” is a part. Now “Christendom”, under the influence of the demons, has openly taken the side of dictators of the totalitarian rule. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the great religious organization, takes the lead in this and backs up the totalitarian rule. Such is the modern-day “oppressing city”; meaning the organization that oppresses, that is to say, “Christendom.” This oppressing religious organization, God declares, “is filthy and polluted.” (Zeph. 3:1) But when the fight at Armageddon begins the oppressive city shall go down, and nothing can save her. Upon that organization God pours his righteous indignation, and all the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon her. Only those who are of good will toward Jehovah God can possibly be saved. Jehovah’s indignation being poured out upon all the nations of earth, the entire earthly, visible rule shall cease; and this is true because the demons now exercise power, influence and control over the nations. (Dan. 2:39) As to the result, God through his prophet says: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.”—Isa. 24:5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PURE LANGUAGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> The Word of God, addressed to those who love him and who are therefore given an understanding of his Word, reads: “For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.” (Zeph. 3:9) Human interpretation of prophecy is seldom, if ever, correct. When God brings to pass the physical facts in fulfillment of prophecy, then man can understand and appreciate that prophecy, provided he is devoted to God and His service.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">” In this text, Zephaniah 3: 9, the word “then” does not mean immediately following the battle of Armageddon. It does not mean that immediately after Armageddon all languages will cease and a new, general language will be adopted. There is nothing in the Scriptures to support that conclusion. The word “then” means that, before the battle of Armageddon begins, the “sheep” class, that is, those who are on the side of Jehovah God, will be given the truth and together speak the truth, a pure, undefiled message. The Scriptures show beyond all doubt that those who are on the side of The Theocratic Government and act in harmony with and support of that government will be the only ones that will survive Armageddon. The oppressors will be destroyed at Armageddon. Therefore the words “a pure language” could not be given to those, who are destroyed. The literal and marginal reading of this text is, “a pure lip”; that is, lips that are given wholly to the praise of the great Theocrat and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> In 1918 Christ Jesus at Jehovah’s command straightway came to the temple and gathered unto himself the faithful “remnant” of those who had consecrated themselves to do the will of God. That was in “the day of Jehovah”, which had begun in 1914. The faithful remnant were brought into complete unity in Christ Jesus as a result of that temple judgment. Thereafter the Lord began to gather his &quot;other sheep”, which “other sheep” will form the &quot;great multitude”, and which company must also speak the truth in unity with the faithful remnant. The remnant goes forth then with this pure message, “pure lip,&quot; a language of praise to Jehovah, and the &quot;other sheep”, their “companions”, join with them in such pure lip. They work together in unity to the praise of Jehovah and thus harmoniously support The Theocratic Government. The words of the text, to wit, &quot;For then will I turn to the people a pure lip,” necessarily mean within the time, that is to say, within the day of Jehovah. That day of Jehovah began when Christ Jesus was enthroned as King, in 1914. The day of judgment began when Christ Jesus began, in 1918, the gathering unto himself and the cleansing of those who had made a consecration to do the will of God. and these gathered and approved ones must offer an offering in righteousness. (Mal. 3:1-4) All such ones gathered and who continued faithful came to see clearly that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the real issue, and therefore they all united in proclaiming the praise of Jehovah. Only those who speak the truth in unity will survive Armageddon. When the purpose of Jehovah is seen and appreciated, then a better understanding is had and the meaning of the prophecy becomes clear. This &quot;pure lip” or pure message must be proclaimed before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> The Devil used Nimrod in an effort to cement the people together in wickedness and for the purpose of bringing reproach upon Jehovah’s name. God broke up that wicked united movement to reproach his name. (Gen. 11:7-9) The Devil makes an attempt to again reunite all the wicked. Just before Armageddon he puts forth a desperate effort to turn all the people against Jehovah, and for this purpose he employs the totalitarian methods first put in operation through Nimrod. By the totalitarian rule the Devil attempts to bind the people and to regiment them and to completely carry out unity of action against The Theocratic Government. In this the big religionists fraudulently claim to represent God and lead the people into the trap of the enemy. Thereupon God gathers to himself his own people and brings them into full unity, and gives them his message, that they may all speak the truth while the opposers of The Theocratic Government rush madly on to destruction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> Therefore within the day of Jehovah he turns to his people, the remnant and their companions, “a pure lip,” that is to say, a lip that gives praise to and glorifies the name of the great Theocrat and his government of righteousness. In harmony with this it is written, in Hebrews, these words: “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.”—Heb. 13:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>21</sup> These words here quoted are addressed to the spiritual class. Such faithful ones joyfully bear the reproaches that come upon God and Christ. They have no abiding place in the organization of Satan, but are seeking that great city or organization, The Theocratic Government. In the name of Christ Jesus, the Head of the remnant, all his faithful servants ‘offer unto Jehovah an offering in righteousness’. They offer “sacrifice of praise to God continually”; that is, their lips are given to praise his name. A plain picture of the cleansing of the lip by fire is given in the prophecy which states: ‘The angel took from the altar a coal of fire, and put it upon the lip, and thus cleansed the lip of speech of the servant class.’ (Isa. 6:5-7) Following the cleansing of the faithful ones at the temple judgment these faithful ones are represented as saying: “0 Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.” (Ps. 51:15) &quot;With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.” (Ps. 119:13,17) &quot;The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue [now wagging world-wide, uttering many foolish theories] is but for a moment.” (Prov. 12:19) All the theories of peace, prosperity and world happiness advanced by men shall continue only for a very short while. Stating the rule with reference to creatures, the Lord says: “Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.” (Prov. 16:13) Thus do those who are kings and priests unto God and Christ speak the praise of Jehovah and his kingdom: “He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.” (Prov. 22:11) Concerning those who have a pure heart toward God and his kingdom, who love Jehovah and his Theocratic Government under Christ, such speak a pure message. They have the grace or favor from the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>22</sup> The Lord is in no wise the friend of those who speak the words of opposition to The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>23</sup> Spiritual Israel had displeased Jehovah at the time of the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, and this is shown by the prophecy at Isaiah 12:1-3. To spiritual Israel these words properly apply, to wit: “0 Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord; say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.” (Hos. 14:1, 2) The words of the psalmist are here appropriate: “What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good? Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.” (Ps. 34:12-14) “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile; let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers ; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.”—1 Pet. 3:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>24</sup> The speech or lip cannot be pure if it does not honor Jehovah. There must be a pure heart devotion to Almighty God and his kingdom, and then the speech will be pure. “For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.”—Matt. 12: 34.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>23</sup> In the face of all wicked opposition to The Theocratic Government the faithful servants and devotees thereof continue to offer praise of their lips unto God and his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>26</sup> The dividing line must be clearly marked. A great gulf is between those who oppose and those who are fully devoted to The Theocracy. Therefore the Lord turns to his people a pure lip and a pure speech, “that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.” First, those of the “remnant” are brought into full unity in Christ; and then come those who will form the “great multitude” and who are made the “companions” of the remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>27</sup> This text of Zephaniah could have no application to the world, which is in confusion. The Scriptures abundantly prove, and the facts fully support the Scriptures, that the world is under the dominating control of demons and therefore in confusion. These human creatures in confusion are not and will not be converted to righteousness. The language of Zephaniah’s prophecy, therefore, could not apply to them, as above stated. Only those who are of good will, who turn to the Lord, and who seek righteousness and meekness, have any prospect of understanding and being hid in the day of the Lord's anger: “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.&quot;—Joel 2:32.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">” Beginning with 1918 the temple judgment progressed. The approved were then commissioned and sent forth to offer unto the Lord sacrifices of righteousness. They were commissioned to do the witness work to Jehovah’s name and also that those who will form the “great multitude” might learn, receive instruction, and flee to the kingdom. Therefore it is written, in Romans 10:14-16: “How then shall they [the Jonadabs, who will form the ‘great multitude’] call on him [Jehovah] in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent [with a pure lip and pure message of truth free from all religion and hypocrisy] ? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?&quot; The apostle Paul quotes these words from the prophecy, and in fulfillment of the prophecy God does his “strange work”, using his witnesses until Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>29</sup> The remnant and their companions, the “great multitude” company, join together “to serve him with one consent”. Note the marginal reading is, “with one shoulder”; that is, all of the witnesses joyfully shoulder the burden and carry on the witness work in unity, illustrated by the twelve witnesses for the Lord with Joshua gathering up the stones and putting them on their shoulders and carrying them forth as a witness to the name of Jehovah God. (Josh. 4:5) It is only those persons of good will, meaning the “remnant” and the Jonadabs, that employ the “pure lip&quot; or pure speech, that stand firm against the Devil and all his agents, and that continue to declare the name of the Lord and his kingdom. It is only such that survive Armageddon. They continue their songs of praise unitedly until and then after Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GATHERING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> The work performed by the witnesses of the Lord has to do with the gathering. The people that are anxious to see and enter into the righteous government are gathered to the Lord. Those who are opposed to The Theocracy are gathered for destruction. Spiritual Israelites scattered about the nations are gathered unto the Lord in unity: “From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.”—Zeph. 3:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>31</sup> Ethiopia in the type was a warlike ally of Egypt. In the type Ethiopia pictures Satan’s visible organization prepared for and engaging in selfish pursuits and in war for spoil. Spiritual Israelites, although surrounded by the organization of Satan, have no part in the wicked organization of Satan. Ethiopia, therefore, here represents the Devil's organization, out from which some of God’s people are gathered. By the hand of Moses God gathered his chosen people out of Egypt and from her allies. The time comes for God to gather his spiritual, chosen people out from the Devil’s organization. This really means the second time of gathering; therefore it is written: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time [since the day of Moses] to recover the reinnant of his people [spiritual Israel], which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations [to which the remnant of spiritual Israel were scattered], and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.’’ (Isa. 11:11,12) Thus the Lord by his prophet foretold the gathering of the spiritual Israelites in bringing them to the temple judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>32</sup> During the World War many of the consecrated were frightened and became negligent of their duties They were spattered and messed up with religion, which resulted in their lawlessness of lips unto the Lord. They failed to proclaim his name. To such Jehovah speaks in Hosea 14:1, 2: “0 Israel, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>33</sup> To the cry of these to take away all their iniquity God replies: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him [spiritual Israel].” (Hos. 14:4) Then apply the words of the prophet Jeremiah, to wit: “In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping; they shall go, and seek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.”—Jer. 50:4,5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“The prophecy of Zephaniah (3:10) according to another version reads: “The daughter of my scattered ones </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[Young]</span><span class="font7"> shall bring my offering.” These dispersed or scattered ones are all a virgin class. They have not been tied up with religion, but have been-kept under the influence of the world organization. Desiring the righteous government they flee from Satan’s organization and come to Mount Zion, that is, the kingdom under Christ, and bring their offering, to wit, ‘the calves [strength of a young bullock] of their lips.’ (Hos. 14: 2) They bring all the strength they possess to the service and praise of The Theocratic Government. (Heb. 13:15) Jehovah shows his favor to those who thus devote themselves to him: “I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the Lord; and I will heal him.” (Isa. 57:19) “In that time shall the present be brought unto the Lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion.”—Isa. 18: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">” Following the World War and the releasing of God’s people from restraint, in 1919, the work of gathering from the far-away countries began. Some in antitypical Ethiopia showed good will toward God, and they came with the remnant of spiritual Israel. This is shown in the prophetic drama of Jeremiah, who was befriended by Ebed-melech, These are they that shall form the “great multitude”. (Jer. 38: 7-13) As to the rest of the Ethiopians or Cushites, that is, those who are against The Theocracy, Jehovah says: “Ye shall be slain by my sword.”—Zeph. 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>88</sup> Particularly after 1922, when the witness work took on an increased fillip or greater energy, the remnant of spiritual Israel was gathered. “In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride; and thou shalt no more be haughty because of mine holy mountain.”-Zeph. 3:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>87</sup> Prior thereto spiritual Israel had transgressed because of fear, and also still held to some religious practices, which they had brought with them out of Babylon. Jehovah then cleansed the temple class by his great Refiner. (Dan. 8:14; Mal. 3:1-4) The proud and haughty amongst the professed followers of Christ were taken away from the faithful, obedient ones by means of revealing to the faithful the truths then due: “Light is sown for the righteous”; and thereafter such began to walk in the increased light and straightway vigorously engaged in the witness work, giving the strength of their lips in praise to Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>88</sup> The proud were relegated to the “evil servant” class. They were not willing to receive instruction. (Matt. 24 : 48-51) Such proud ones gloried in their human leaders, especially their one human leader. They also took pride in “character development” and other religious practices and prided themselves on the expectation of being shortly taken to heaven and helping the Lord rule the universe. Therefore they discriminated against the earthly class, the “great multitude”, and refused to put forth any effort whatsoever to take the truth to them. They remained idle, ‘waiting for the Lord to take them home and relieve them from their great labor.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>89</sup> Pride and haughtiness and self-importance must cease amongst those devoted to The Theocracy. To such the Lord says: “And thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.” (R.F.) From that time forth the words of the prophet have been appropriate, to wit: “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord! or who shall stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.” —Ps. 24: 3, 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>40</sup> God’s faithful servants, receiving instruction from the Lord, learned that the vindication of his great name is of all-importance, and that took away from them any cause for acting or even thinking haughtily. By 1925 the faithful were well rid of religious folly and of haughty thinking. God revealed to his people in the year 1926 (The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> May 1) the folly of “character development”. The faithful spiritual Israelites then saw that each one is required to be faithfully devoted to The Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>41</sup> The temple judgment, which began in 1918 by the Lord Jesus Christ, cleared out the “evil servant”, and then the faithful went straight on with their assigned duties. All spiritual Israelites must come to a unity of the faith and all must serve Jehovah harmoniously; therefore says the Lord to those in a covenant with him: “For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me; there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. I will accept you with your sweet savour, when [ bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered: and 1 will be sanctified in you before the heathen.”-Ezek. 20:40,41.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>42</sup> God’s sanctuary must be cleansed, and such cleansing work began when Christ Jesus came to the temple. The “evil servant” class must be cleared out and the witness work must be done by the faithful: “I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.”—Zeph. 3:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>48</sup> Here the Lord tells of his purpose to clear out the evil servants. (See also Matthew 13: 41, 42.) The faithful servants must now do the work Jehovah assigns to them. By his prophet God foretold the purpose to clear out the rebels and to bring the faithful into the bond of the covenant for the kingdom : “And</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.”—Ezek. 20: 38.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>44</sup> The proud ones gathered out, there was left in the land “a people humble and poor&quot; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font7">; that is to say, a people disciplined by the Lord’s purging work and by his directing, that they as his sons who had wholly devoted themselves to his Theocratic Government have God’s approval. (Heb. 12:7,8) The faithful trusted in the name of the Lord, and they trust not in men who act as visible leaders. The faithful servants of God do not trust in any creature, religion or thing. They are weak and poor in themselves, and all their strength is in the Lord, upon whom they depend. At the present time the “remnant” see themselves encompassed by a mass of enemies, which enemies reproach the name of Jehovah and ill-use his servants. The faithful are not divided in their work, but they look forward to the day of deliverance and continue to sing to Jehovah: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>45</sup> The dividing or cleansing work accomplished, in 1931 the Lord revealed to his approved ones their “new name” and showed them that they were his witnesses. Then quickly followed the wicked persecution of all the faithful ones in Europe, who boldly declared the name of Jehovah. In that persecution the Roman Catholic Hierarchy took the lead, and in this they were aided by the “evil servant” class, and such persecution has extended to all parts of “Christendom” where God’s people are to be found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>46</sup> Jehovah selected a people for his name, which people constitutes the remnant of spiritual Israel: “The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.”—Zeph. 3:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>41</sup> What would specifically constitute iniquity as here mentioned? Anything that is done in opposition to God’s law because of fear or because of failing or refusing to go about and boldly preach the gospel of The Theocratic Government as commanded. Anything that would induce one to fail to declare the day of the vengeance of our God upon all the opposers of The Theocracy. The holding to religious practices or rules which make the commandments of God void, as, for instance, formal religious services used instead of following the divine rule; also any practice of bestowing honor and praise upon the creatures, which constitutes “the sin of Samaria”. All of these things are iniquitous in the sight of the Lord; which must be cleared out. (Mark 7:1-13; Job 32:21,22; Amos 8:14) From and after such cleansing the “remnant” must keep clean and free from lawlessness. Any one of the instructed who becomes defiled by religion or religious practices automatically ceases to be of the remnant. “As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.”—Ps. 125: 2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">“ The remnant must not “speak lies”: the preaching of any religious doctrine; or adding to God’s Word anything like that of “the ‘Great Pyramid’ witness”, as though it taught a doctrine of the Lord; or such things as “character development”. (Prov. 30: 5, 6; Rev. 22:18,19) The restored remnant must do what? “These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath; for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord.”— Zech. 8:16,17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup>* As stated in Zephaniah 3: 9, the Lord has turned to his people a “pure lip”; and hence he says: “Neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth.” The faithful remnant are not guilty of having sworn a vow of consecration to the Lord and thereafter failing to carry out that vow. They are not like the “elective elder” class, who promise to do and then fail to do that which they promise. (Matt. 23:3) The faithful remnant do not take the name of God in vain by failing or refusing to be active witnesses to the name of Jehovah. (Ex. 20: 7) They are true witnesses of the Lord: “A true witness deliv-ereth souls; but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.” —Prov. 14: 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>50</sup> The Lord’s angels cleared out all the ’ evil servant”, who ‘served not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly, and who by good words and fair speech deceived the hearts of the simple’. (Rom. 16:17,18) Some of such have been gathered out recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NO FEAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>51</sup> The faithful remnant trust wholly in the Lord, and they do not fear creatures. They trust in Jehovah and are at rest. “For they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.” (Zeph. 3:13) There is no famine amongst God’s faithful people for hearing the Word of the Lord. (Amos 8:11) To restored spiritual Israel, “the remnant of her seed,” Jehovah now says: “But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the Lord of hosts. For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.&quot;—Zech. 8:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>52</sup> This further precious promise Jehovah gives to his faithful spiritual Israelites: *T will also save you from all your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen.”—Ezek. 36: 29, 30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>53</sup> During the World War the enemy said to Jehovah’s dispersed people: '’They are done for.” But their saying is different now, because everyone sees the ‘’remnant” active in the proclamation of The Theocracy : “And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, and desolate, and ruined cities, are become fenced, and are inhabited.” (Ezek. 36: 35) The faithful do not lie down on the job; they go straight on in the witness work and God gives them rest and peace.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>54</sup> Why should any of God’s people be afraid of what men or devils may do to them? Jehovah has made it clear to his people that the power of the demons is exercised chiefly by the religious men. The faithful know they are surrounded by both invisible and visible enemies, but they trust in the power and protection of Jehovah of hosts. The faithful are perfect in love, that is, in their entire devotion to The Theocratic Government; and hence perfect love casts out all fear of man and demons. They have boldness in this day of judgment in declaring the truth. (1 John 4:17,18) They do not put on the soft pedal concerning the Theocratic message, nor do they yield to the demands of religious agents of the Devil. They obey God rather than men.—Acts 5: 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>55</sup> Looking back to 1922 and the way Jehovah has led his people from that time onward, there is every reason for Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions to rejoice. From the human viewpoint the way has grown much more difficult, but from the viewpoint of those who are wholly devoted to Jehovah God the way has grown brighter with each succeeding year. Jehovah has opened the windows of heaven and poured out upon his people the richest blessings. He has revealed to them an understanding of his prophecies written long ago, and with the unfolding of such prophecies the faithful have more clearly seen that all these things were written for the aid and comfort and increased hope of those now on the earth who are devoted to The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>50</sup> Satan, seeing that his time to get ready for the battle is short, has hurriedly gathered all nations against Jehovah’s witnesses, with the expectation of crushing such witnesses. The religionists have taken the lead in the wicked persecution of Jehovah’s servants, and the religionists have brought into action as their allies in wickedness the political, commercial, judicial and military branches of world organizations. These are the “mighty men” against The Theocratic Government. The Devil’s monstrosity, the totalitarian state, raises its wicked head and boastfully declares that Jehovah’s witnesses shall be destroyed; and these, together with other visible and invisible elements of Satan's organization, use every means available to bring about the destruction of the faithful, but they cannot succeed. Jehovah in the heavens has his enemies in derision. He sends forth his faithful servants to sound the final warning that destruction shall shortly come upon them. The enemies rage and defy God, spurn his message, and persecute his messengers. But all their efforts shall fail to bring about the destruction or injury of those who serve the Most High. The faithful know what will be the final result. They know that Jehovah is all-powerful and that He will carry out his purpose, and that very soon complete deliverance shall come to all who love and serve the Most High. What, then, should be the attitude of the faithful servants of God now on the earth? What is their attitude, and then-condition of mind and heart? Jehovah, by his prophet long ago, answers these questions.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ESCAPE FROM &quot;CHRISTENDOM’S” CONFLAGRATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">( ( 1 ’IRE and sulphur from heaven . . . destroyed them j&quot;’ all ” That conflagration took place “on the day that Lot went out from Sodom”. The great Teacher, Christ Jesus himself, gives us his word for it, at Luke 17 : 29, and then, what is important to us today, he adds: “Thus will it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.&quot;— Luke 17 : 30, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christendom” particularly is modern Sodom. We know that Sodom prophetically pictured Satan’s organization on earth, and particularly that part called “Christendom”, because it is written that, after the death of the Lord Jesus Christ, the witnesses of God on earth were killed by the beastly organization and their dead bodies lay in the street of “the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom . . . where also our Lord was crucified”. (Rev. 11: 3-8) The inhabitants of Sodom were practitioners of the Devil religion and were exceedingly wicked. Lot was a nephew of the patriarch Abraham and dwelt in the plain near Sodom. The record reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they [Abraham and Lot] separated themselves the one from the other. Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. But the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.” (Gen. 13:10-13) “Behold, this was the iniquity of . . . Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.” (Ezek. 16:49,50) “Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.”—Jude 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of the great wickedness that existed in Sodom Jehovah God sent his angelic representatives to Sodom to ascertain the facts concerning the abominations done there and to destroy Sodom. On the way those representatives of Jehovah informed Abraham of God’s purpose. “And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.” (Gen. 18:20,21) Abraham, having in mind his nephew Lot, who would be subject to destruction unless protected, made an earnest plea before the Lord God that Sodom might be spared from destruction if a certain number of persons there were found to be righteous. God informed Abraham that if as many as ten righteous persons could be found in Sodom He would not destroy it.—Gen. 18:22-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But that number could not be found in Sodom. There a violent mob of Sodomites stormed the house of “just Lot”, “that righteous man,” and they howled for the bodies of Lot’s angelic visitors, that they might commit sodomy with them; and that mob also attempted violence upon Lot. Without any question that mob was under the influence and control of demons. (Gen. 19:1-11; 2 Pet. 2: 7, 8) Only Lot and his wife and two daughters were found to be the ones who had faith in God. The Lord showed his mercy toward Lot, his wife and two daughters, and caused them to be led out and away from the place of destruction. “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brimstone, and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.”—Gen. 19:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until quite recently God’s faithful people on the earth understood that most of the peoples of the earth would pass through the great tribulation of the battle of Armageddon. This understanding corresponds with Abraham’s expressed hope that the city, picturing “Christendom” down at this end of the world, would be saved because of some righteous ones there But now it is seen that it is only those who seek Jehovah God and righteousness and meekness that have the promise of being “hid”, spared and taken through Armageddon. (See Zephaniah 2:3; 1 Peter 4:18.) The Scriptures state: “God spared not . . . turning the'cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; and delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;) the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.” (2 Pet. 2:4-9) Sodom is set forth as an example of those whom God will destroy at Armageddon.—Jude 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The angels of the Lord appearing on earth as men and as the Lord’s representatives led Lot and his family out of Sodom before the destructive fire was sent down upon the city. “The men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.” Then the angels warned them as to what they should do: “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.”—Gen. 19:16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The final fulfillment of this prophetic picture, without doubt, is at the end of Satan’s world, where we now are, and after the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the reason that Jesus said: “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, the} planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot’s wife.”— Luke 17:28-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this prophetic picture Lot and his family represented or foreshadowed those persons who are of good will toward Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under Christ and who now hear the warning concerning the great destruction that will come upon Satan’s world at Armageddon. That warning is now being sounded throughout the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses. It is certain that the destruction of Sodom pictured Armageddon, and that Sodom particularly foreshadowed that part of Satan’s organization called “Christendom”. Unfaithful Jerusalem also pictured “Christendom”, and to the rulers of religious Jerusalem Jel.oxal: by his prophet said: “Hear the word of the Lord, ye ruleis of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah: to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts? Bring no more vain oblations, incense is an abomination unto me ; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with, it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth. they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you ; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless; plead for the widow. . . . But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword [Armageddon] ; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.” —Isaiah 1:10-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations which are known as “Christendom” have in these latter days become exceedingly wicked, and such religious practitioners are the ones that wickedly persecute Jehovah’s witnesses because these stand for God and his kingdom and insist on obeying God and Christ Jesus in proclaiming the message of the kingdom. According to Matthew 25: 32-46, Christ Jesus counts the persecution and punishment inflicted upon his faithful followers, his “brethren” on earth, as though it were done unto himself. The conditions that obtained in and about Sodom exactly fit the conditions that now exist in “Christendom”. Jesus, speaking of the conditions that would prevail upon earth at the time of his second coming, in glory as a divine spirit, likens such conditions unto those in ancient Sodom, thus further proving that the destruction of Sodom was a type or prophetic pattern and that it foreshadowed what shall come to pass upon “Christendom” at Armageddon. “So, too, in the days of Lot. People were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building; but, on the very day on which Lot came out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from the skies and destroyed them all. It will be the same on the day on which the Son of Man reveals himself.”—Luke 17: 28-30, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Twentieth Century New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The facts now conclusively prove that throughout the land of “Christendom” the men who operate the religious systems do so for selfish reasons and by these religious systems they carry on a racket and are entirely oblivious to the warning God is causing to be sounded in their presence concerning the approaching time of Armageddon. Thus it is clearly seen that the prophecy of the Lord Jesus is now being fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only faith, but also obedience, is emphasized in the picture of Lot fleeing from Sodom. The angels of the Lord, having led Lot and his family away from Sodom before destruction began, then warned them in these words: “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee.” “Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.” (Gen. 19:24-26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> Lot’s wife utterly disregarded the warning from the representatives of the Lord, and her looking back was an act of disobedience, and the result was that there a pillar of salt stood forth as a monument of her disobedience and clearly appears to say, in substance: “When one undertakes to obey the Lord, he must then continue in faith and faithfully obey God’s commandments. Obedience to the Lord must be continuous and unconditional.” At Luke 9:62, Jesus said: “No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hence Jesus, describing conditions that will prevail on earth at the time of Armageddon, said: “In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. Remember Lot’s wife.” (Luke 17:31,32) And thus Jesus emphasized the importance of full obedience. Having once started to follow the Lord, then he who turns back shall not survive. This was pictured by Lot’s wife looking back and by the one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back or turns back. There is only one way that leads to life; and when one starts in that way and then turns back, destruction is ceitain to result, because, said Jesus, “strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it.” (Matt. 7:13,14) Life is a gracious gift of God through Christ Jesus; and when one having learned the way of life starts in that way and then turns back, he draws back to perdition, destruction; and such is his fate —See Hebrews 6: 4-6 and 10: 26-29, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lot and his family received the warning to flee, and they fled before destruction fell upon Sodom and Gomorrah. Likewise those who form the “great multitude” of persons of good will that will be “hid” during the battle of Armageddon receive the warning to flee, and they must flee to the Lord’s Theocratic Government before Armageddon begins. Further, they must abide under the Lord's protection, seeking meekness and righteousness, until the fire of Armageddon has completely burned out; otherwise they will be destroyed together with “Christendom” and all the rest of Satan’s organization. These things are recorded in the Bible as a pattern or guide for those who today undertake to serve the Lord now and for ever.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ACTIVITY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is always faithful to his covenant. For his own name’s sake and in fulfillment of his word he will carry out his covenant, regardless of what those in the other side of the covenant do or may not do. Through his prophet Moses as mediator Jehovah made the Law Covenant with the organization of his typical people Israel when that organization was yet young or was in its youth. Except for a remnant of that organization, the Israelites rebelled against the Law Covenant, and God cast that organization away; but to the faithful remnant he said: “Nevertheless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.”—Ezekiel 16: 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise Jehovah now has remembered his new covenant made through Christ Jesus as Mediator, and made with the organization of his chosen ones in the days of the youth of that Christian organization and before rebellious members thereof produced what is called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”. It is “Christendom” that claims presumptuously the sole interest in the covenant for the heavenly crown and for the kingdom of heaven, and yet “Christendom” has been entirely unfaithful to its implied covenant with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has been long-suffering with “Christendom”, but he has not forgotten his word spoken for the benefit of his faithful remnant of anointed witnesses In A.D. 1914, agreeable to his promise and in fulfillment of prophecy, he placed his King, Christ Jesus, upon his heavenly throne and he fully established his covenant and kingdom. It is through this covenant-kingdom that the people of good will who flee out of “Christendom” and to the kingdom and who obediently serve God and Christ the King will have opportunity for everlasting life on the earth and all the blessings thereof. All such clearly recognize that “religion is a snare and a racket” and they diligently avoid that snare and instead learn and do righteousness. To the religionists of “Christendom” it has happened as with typical Israel, to wit: “Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.” (Rom. 11:7) The “election” means the kingdom class elected of Jehovah God, to wit, Christ Jesus and the 144,000 members of “his body, which is the church”, and these will administer the affairs of Jehovah's Theocratic Government for the blessing of all who forsake Babylon, the Devil’s organization, including “Christendom”, and who willingly join themselves in joyful activity as God’s people, serving Him unselfishly wherever under bis organization they may be assigned to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The primary purpose of Jehovah’s “new covenant” which he makes with the spiritual Israel is for the vindication of his holy name, and by its operation he takes out from among the nations a “people for his name”, to act as his witnesses on earth. (Jeremiah 31: 31-34) The new covenant has already been made with Christ Jesus as Mediator, the Elect of God and the Head of his anointed ones, the members of his body. A remnant thereof arc to be found on earth since A.D. 1918. Ashamed of their former ways due to exercising a measure of religion and fear of creatures, they have turned to Jehovah God in devotion to his Theocratic Government under Christ. They are called “the daughter of Zion”, and to them Jehovah says concerning others who arc not spiritual Israelites but who become earthly companions or associates with the spiritual remnant: “Then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant [the Law Covenant with typical Israel].”— Ezekiel 16:61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christendom” has made vows or covenants unto God and has broken them all, and therefore God, by reason of “Christendom’s” unfulfilled part of her implied covenant or vows, is under no obligation to “Christendom”. Jehovah made the new covenant with Christ Jesus as the representative of the “people for his name” who should be taken into that covenant, and now since A.D. 1918 Jehovah has confirmed and inaugurated that new covenant toward his faithful remnant on earth, to whom he has given the “new name”, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” As it is written (Ezekiel 16: 62) : “And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> Now also a “great multitude” of people of good will come from among all nations, kindreds, peoples, and tongues, as foreshadowed by ancient Sodom and Samaria; they come in response to the witness concerning Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ, The Theocratic Government, and they associate themselves with the spiritual remnant and join with them in giving the witness. They become the “virgins, her companions”, the earthly companions of the bride of Christ, the church.—Psalm 45:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah in 1918 the remnant who had responded to the call for the kingdom were tested and approved, and were set in a company to themselves, that they might “offer unto [Jehovah] an offering in righteousness”. (Malachi 3: 1-3) It was then that the prophecies began to be unfolded to these approved ones, and then they must, by Christ Jesus the Head of the temple, offer a righteous sacrifice of praise unto God continually. (Hebrews 13:15) In doing such the temple class must, as God’s chosen witnesses, serve notice upon “Christendom” of her abominations and of the thing that is coming to pass by reason thereof. The facts must be put before “Christendom” in order that she might justify her extravagant kingdom claims, or else admit the truth and be condemned; and God’s witnesses must serve the notice. —Isaiah 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now God reveals to his people an understanding of the prophecies long ago written ‘for their learning’, that they may be encouraged and know that they are in the right way, and that their hope may be made strong. These faithful ones, seeing that they may have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, enter into the joy of the Lord and delight to proclaim Jehovah’s doings to the people. The witnesses of Jehovah are not slacking their hand in the work and calculating whether the days will be few or many. On the contrary, with singleness of purpose and ever-increasing boldness they go on, busily declaring Jehovah’s truth, his ‘high praises and judgments’ (Psalm 149), ser\-ing notice concerning the day of God’s vengeance and of the continuing “increase of his government”, which government “shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms” and which alone, as The Theocracy, shall abide for ever (Isaiah 9: 6, 7; Daniel 2:44) Confidently they work, knowing that Almighty God will take care of the result in his due time. The “servant” class thus has a part in the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name, and likewise al) persons of good will who consecrate themselves to do only the will of Almighty God have a share in that work, all acting unitedly under the leadership of Jehovah’s Leader and Commander. Christ Jesus, the King—Isaiah 55-4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the Scriptures Jehovah’s kingdom is made prominent. Following the rebellion of his creatures at Eden God’s first promise was that he would provide a King and a kingdom. (Genesis 3:15) It is that righteous go\eminent, The Theocracy, that will vindicate the word and name of Jehovah before all creation When, in 606 B C , God dethroned Zedekiah his typical king o'er Israel, because of Zedekiah’s wickedness, God declared that no one would again rule in His name “until he come whose right it is” (Ezekiel 21: 27) In due time Jesus came. After the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness Jehovah made a covenant with him that he should be the King of the world and the one “whose right it is” to rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the ministry of Jesus Christ he spoke moie thoroughly of God’s kingdom and emphasized it more than anything else, and most of his speech concerning it was in parables or dark sayings, which may now be understood Jehovah had likewise spoken by his prophets who preceded the ministry of Jesus on earth. Now that kingdom is here<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now that government “upon his shoulder” is functioning' (Isaiah 9:6,7) Now the publishers of the Kingdom joyfully and incessantly announce God’s judgments already written in the Bible against the “man of sin”, against “Christendom”, her rulers, and chief men, and against all who have defamed the name of the Most High. Fearlessly and clearly they sound the warning of the great tribulation just ahead for all that dwell upon the face of the whole earth, and they make known how some may be shielded and protected and carried through that greatest of all calamities, in which the power of the Eternal One shall be shown in “his strange act”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Haling read the article “Information” in the October 15 issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> we wish to express our disapproval of the things done by 0 R. Moyle against the family at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not know the contents of the letter written by Mr. Moyle, nor do we care to know. It is enough for us that our great God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font4"> is pleased to use you all in his service, and is showering you with blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe that the Society is the channel the Lord is using to carry on his Kingdom interests in earth at this time, and that our brethren at Bethel are being spent in that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We never listen to accusations against Brother Rutherford or any faithful servant of God who is performing his given service in the Theocratic Government; for to do so would be disobedient</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Continued from page 194)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">dates will be July 24-28 inclusive. Announcement is made in advance in order that Jehovah’s witnesses and all people of good will may have ample opportunity to arrange their affairs so as to be at Columbus, Ohio, or other cities tied in by direct wire communication and loud-speaker equipment. By the Lord’s grace, the president of the Watchtower Society will be in attendance in person at the key assembly m Columbus. For further details see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> issues of June 1 and 15, 1940. and dangerous to ourselves. All of the faithful, having been warned, would do well to be on their guard against the wiles of those “wild waves of the sea, . . . for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved for ever”. (Jude 13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A R V</span><span class="font4"> ) These do not discern the body, but, as Jude says, ‘show respect of persons for the sake of advantage.’—Jude 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to force of circumstances while I am still ‘tent making’ we are seldom where there is a company of servants We know that the faithful all over the earth will hasten to stand openly on the side of our brethren at Bethel, and against all wicked accusers We, also, wish to be found fighting shoulder to shoulder with our brethren, and to let it be known that, by Jehovah’s grace, we shall ever be found standing for Jehovah God, his King Christ Jesus, the Kingdom, and all who faithfully serve that kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With much love, we remain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your brethren and fellow locusts,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren of the North unit [of Chicago, Ill , company] of Jehovah’s witnesses have unanimously adopted the following resolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We, Jehovah’s witnesses of the North unit will be on the alert for any information from the enemy in relation to the things Brother Howlett brought to our attention Sunday, October 1, 1939, relative to 0. R. Moyle. We are one hundred percent back of you in the Theocratic Government, pushing forward to publish the Kingdom as commanded by the Almighty God through his Vindicator King Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">IN HARMONY WITH ACTION TAKEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We, the Racine [Wis.] company of Jehovah’s witnesses, wish to express our disapproval of the actions of 0 R Moyle against the Society and its president. We do hereby acknowledge the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Society</span><span class="font4"> as the visible channel of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and we are in complete harmony with the action taken by the board of directors. We are thankful to the Society for sending Brother Howlett in our midst to explain the matter, which he did so well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINE WORK VICTORY IN CHICAGO NORTH UNIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“March 9 fifteen publishers were placed at one of the busiest intersections which incorporated the large Scars and Roebuck store. After working about an hour a police officer came and informed us we could not do this work. We answered we were within our God-given rights as well as the right of the Supreme Court. The officer then said if we did not discontinue work he would haul us in. We refused to leave. About 20 minutes later two detectives began rounding up all the publishers in front of the Sears store. The large signs worn by the publishers were a great attraction to the public. One publisher took advantage of telling the officer that we could not buy the advertising through the public press that wc were receiving there then. The police wagon came, picked up the 15 publishers (6 men, 3 ladies, and 6 children), and took them to the station. We asked the sergeant what the charge was. The reply was, the complainant would be there shortly and the charge would be filed later. The officer stated the real complainant was Sears &amp;&nbsp;Roebuck, but rather than be exposed they put the burden on the owner of a small dress shop. The men and women were separated and placed in cells accordingly and the children were sent home. All were fingerprinted as though desperate criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Shortly after the chief, sergeant and another man came into the cell and began questioning, cursing and threatening us if we ever came back. Brethren then arrived to offer bail, that the publishers might be released until trial, but to no avail. Next morning another effort was made. Sergeant informed us that $100 cash bond or $400 property bond was required for each. We got in contact with Judge Schiller to sign the property bond, but because of some misunderstanding at the station with the officials the judge became very angry and took upon himself the responsibility of bailing out the publishers, at no expense to us. This did not set well with the chief and sergeant for the reason that they were Roman Catholics. Publishers were then released and case set for the following day. Next day we were called before the Municipal Court. We requested our case be tried by jury. Three weeks later our case was called at the Criminal Court and tried before Judge McCormick, who dismissed it because the complainant did not appear. The complainant was misinformed of our work, and when he learned the real purpose he refused to appear against us This, however, did not stop the arrests. Following week six more were arrested, and two weeks following two more. In the two latter cases the officers were signed as complainants. An issue was made of these cases, and through much prolonging of the courts we finally succeeded in getting our case before a jury. The jury, which found the publishers guilty, was composed of 9 Catholics and 3 others. We were fined $1.00 and costs. This, of course, caused us to ask for an appeal. The judge was not impressed by this because of the small fine involved. Our attorney insisted upon bringing to the attention of the court the ruling of the Supreme Court on cases similar to the one before this court. The judge permitted a continuance, asking the attorneys to investigate the law a little further. This was done, and upon presenting the four cases, plus the South Holland (Ill.) ease in evidence, the decision of the jury was reversed and our case was dismissed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGER CASE IN ANCIENT BAGDAD, IRAQ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“While a witness was away from his hotel room, a friend visited him but found the door locked. He went to the proprietor and told him it was very important to get into his friend’s room, and received permission to break the glass to enter. After he gained entrance he eagerly supplied himself with the latest publications of the Society and Watch</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazines. He left a note: ‘Dear Friend: Not having seen you for a long time I became very hungry for the precious truth as contained in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine and kindred publications. So in order to get a new supply I made up my mind to visit yon When I arrived at your hotel and found you were out I was sadlj disappointed. Immediately I went to the hotel proprietor and told him I came to visit you from another town and found your room locked. Therefore, in order not to return with empty hands I got his permission to enter your room through the broken window and I supplied myself with the Society’s publications.’ Later, after he read and studied, he determined to serve Jehovah and his Theocracy. At the school where he was teaching the school board enacted a law contrary to God’s law and tried to enforce it upon him. He refused because it was against his conscience and Jehovah’s law. On this account he resigned his good position, and now is planning to enter tile pioneer service and devote Ins full time to The Theocracy. This experience took place in the exact spot, Babylon, where centuries ago Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego were thrown into the fiery furnace because they refused to yield to Satan’s representatives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A JEW INWARDLY (BROOKLYN)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The lady had said, asking her husband for a quarter: ‘Oh, it is one of those books I used to read about God / </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">must get that book,</span><span class="font5"> I can’t pass it!’ I called back. 1 found she, though a Jewess -by birth, was really a Jewess at heart, accepted Jesus as the Messiah and her Savior, and had all of Judge Rutherford’s books with the exception of two or three. I made several back-calls, placed with her the three books she did not have, also ten booklets, besides supplying her </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> weekly. She confided that she loved Jehovah from a child, tried to learn as much as she could about Him from the rabbi, read books and magazines extensively, but was never satisfied until she received the truth. The net result is that she has definitely taken her stand for Jehovah, goes out witnessing, her first witness being to the rabbi, and desires to be immersed at the first opportunity. She has also been influential in getting her husband to believe in the ‘New Testament’ and Christ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">TWO MONTHS PREVIOUS AN ATHEIST (TEXAS)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No one at home. A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> left. Later a call, buc no one was there. A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> folder left, with address of the meeting place. Soon, the couple living in that house came to the place of meeting desiring to be associated with the Kingdom workers. On arrival of the Society’s zone servant he called on them. The following Sunday they, with five others, were immersed. They ordered a new Bible, a phonograph, two series of records and several miscellaneous recordings, also contributed $---- to the zone servant. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">are both now in the service. This shows the importance of leaving a slip with the meeting-place address at the door.”</span></p>
