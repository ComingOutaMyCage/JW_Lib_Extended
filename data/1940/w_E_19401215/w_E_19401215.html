<p><span class="font3">WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp;&nbsp;TRACT SOCIETY 117 Adams Street - &nbsp;&nbsp;• Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Officers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">J. F. Rutherford, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">President_______</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">W.  </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">E.

<p><span class="font3">“And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great sha</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">ll be the peace of thy children.” - </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Isaiah 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH la the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on &quot;earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to &quot;fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“COURAGE” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This special Period which occupies the entire month of December is marked by the term “Courage”, a quality which Jehovah repeatedly exhorted Joshua to exercise in driving out the enemies of the theocracy, for an example to us today. December should shatter all previous records in booklet distribution, due to the almost unbelievable offer of seven of any of the -Society’s booklets on a 10c contribution. If possible, every packet of seven should include the latest booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> A special wrapper, provided by the Society, helps make the 7-booklet combination all the more attractive. All this requires special advance work. Especially, attend the weekly service meeting of the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, where the details of the work of “Courage” Testimony Period are being discussed. If you are not in touch with such, write this office for references, Keep accurate record of your activities and report same fully at close of December.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1941 YEARBOOK OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the face of an almost impossible year the publication of the 1941 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> represents an accomplishment made possible only by Jehovah’s power. Confirmation of this you will find when you read the comprehensive report, as written by the Society’s president, covering the world-wide activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, under continuous enemy fire, during the past service year. Besides this amazing report the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> also offers the president’s comment on the 1941 yeartext and a text with a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> comment thereon for each day of the new year. The edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is always limited, thus enhancing the oosts involved; hence a contribution of 59c per copy is stipulated these-for. Organized companies should combine the orders of all individuals therefor and send such through the company servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“SATISFIED&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In these days of increasing dissatisfaction with everything of the world, the title of this new booklet, “Satisfied,” strikes the reader with a strong appeal. The contents of this 32-page booklet show how and by whom the hearts desire of all men of good-will shall early be satisfied. The front-cover picture visualizes the setting of the story as related by the author, Judge Rutherford.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And you will be objects &amp;f hatred to all the nations en account of my name.&quot; —Matt. 24:9, Weymouth; Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">JEHOVAH'S provision for man to gain life ever-I lasting is by and through Christ Jesus. Such is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font3"> God’s gracious gift to obedient men. (Rom. 6: 23) All such persons thus benefiting by the gift must bear the name of Christ Jesus. Those who will inherit the Kingdom with Christ Jesus will live as spirit creatures, and by the Lord these are designated as the “little flock”. (Luke 12:32) Those who will form the “great multitude” and live everlastingly on the earth Jesus speaks of as his “other sheep”, who are brought into his fold. (Rev. 7 : 9-17 ; John 16:10) It necessarily follows that those of both flocks and who are brought into one fold of the Lord Jesus must all bear his name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> All persons who are opposed to The Theocracy are under the influence of Jehovah’s great enemy, the Devil, who is the “god of this world” of wickedness. Therefore such persons under the wicked one’s influence are designated in the Scriptures as those “of the world”. There could be nothing in common between those who bear the name of Christ Jesus and those who oppose The Theocratic Government, of which he is King. There is an impassable gulf between those who are opposed to The Theocracy and those who bear the name of the Theocratic King. Every person who boldly declares himself for The Theocrat and his King, Christ Jesus, is a target against which the Devil and his subjects fire their many wicked missiles of persecution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">children persecuted</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Parents who are devoted to God and Christ are specifically commanded by the Lord to teach their children of and concerning the kingdom of God under Christ, and to he obedient to his laws as the only means of obtaining life everlasting. (Gen. 18:19; Deut. 6: 6, 7 ; 2 Tim. 1: 5; 3:15) Children thus learning that the only way to life is by devotion to and obedience to The Theocbat and his King declare themselves for God and Christ and his kingdom. Such children individually thus choose the side of God and his kingdom. At once such children become the targets for the wicked darts of Satan and those</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">who are devoted to Satan’s world. Their persecution and suffering there begin.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> All totalitarian nations are against Jehovah and his kingdom. Such nations compel the children to conform to the rules of the totalitarian or “corporate” state, and that is done without regard to the conscientious belief, teaching or training of the children. Although the United States claims to be a democracy, in which freedom of worship is guaranteed to all, that nation is now rapidly moving into the totalitarian class. Throughout the States children are expelled from school and denied the privileges thereof for the sole reason that such children refuse to disobey Almighty God’s commandment and therefore refuse to bow down to anything that is on earth, because they conscientiously believe that for them to do so is a violation of the express commandment of Almighty God and that the disobedience to such expressed commandment would deprive them of the privilege of life everlasting. (Deut. 5:8,9; 4: 15-19; 1 John 5: 21) Their devotion is to Almighty God and his King. In God they put their trust and hope. Because the parents refuse to compel their children to violate God’s law and their own conscience the children are then taken away from the parents by the state authorities upon the pretext that the parents are unfit to rear the children. The care and custody of these children is then by the state placed in the hands of those who are opposed to the great Theocracy. Necessarily this brings persecution and suffering upon both the parents and the children. Such suffering is for righteousness’ sake and because they bear the name of God and Christ his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> In their distress parents thus suffering are seeking advice, aid and comfort. Their letters addressed to the Society ask, “What can we do, and what can the Society do for us and our children ?” What is here said, it is hoped, will answer to some extent such inquiries and be of some aid and comfort to both parents and children.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">• The Society has, up to this time, employed every known legal remedy to safeguard the children and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">371</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">(NOTE : Because of the perplexity of many of God’s covenant people who are now being put to grief by reason of the expulsion of their children from school, and in order to answer their questions and if possible give them some aid and comfort, it is deemed proper and necessary that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> should now publish this article. It takes the place in this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> of the Part 3 of “Drama of Vengeance”, which Part 3 will follow in the next issue.)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">their parents from such wrongs thus heaped upon them. The Society has put forth its efforts to get these questions squarely before the courts and to have the decisions in harmony with the guarantees of the Federal Constitution and the Constitutions of the many states. Although the Constitution of the United States guarantees freedom of conscience in belief and worship and service of Almighty God, the highest court in the land has side-stepped this Constitutional guarantee and put the responsibility upon boards of education or school boards to fix and to enforce its own rules according to its own ideas. The conscience of the believer is ignored. While there is no law in the land compelling adults to salute any flag, the school boards have made rules requiring the children, regardless of their conscientious belief, to salute the flag; and, upon remaining silent and refusing to participate in such religious ceremonies, the child is usually expelled from the school and denied the privilege of an education in the public school. Having gone to the very limit in the courts the Society is therefore precluded from taking any further action in behalf of such parents and children in this matter of flag saluting. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> can give advice and point out why the children and parents thus suffer for righteousness’ sake, and it is hoped that by this means aid and comfort may be given&quot; to those in distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">COMFORT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah God is “the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort”. (2 Cor. 1: 3, 4) Those persons who have covenanted to do the will of God are within the special care of Almighty God. To all such he says: “Lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him [God], and he shall direct thy </span><span class="font2">paths.” </span><span class="font3">(Prov. 3:5,6) The consecrated must there</span><span class="font2">fore </span><span class="font3">seek knowledge from God’s Word and then follow the advice given in the Word of God, and not depend upon the opinion of man, nor lean to human reasoning that is out of line with the Word of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Reproaches, persecution and suffering cannot come to the consecrated without the knowledge and permission of Jehovah God. All such have the promise that no sparrow can fall without having God’s notice, and every child of the Lord and every child devoted to God is of far greater importance than sparrows. (Matt. 10:29,31) Why, then, should the children and the parents, both consecrated to do the will of God, be subjected to persecution and suffering at the hands of others because the children and parents obey the commandments of Almighty God? To appreciate the </span><span class="font2">answer to </span><span class="font3">this question will bring real comfort to everyone </span><span class="font2">who is in </span><span class="font3">a covenant to do </span><span class="font2">God’s will </span><span class="font3">and wholly devoted to The Theocracy and the King thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The adversary of Jehovah God is the Devil, who has continuously reproached the name of God since the time of Eden. The challenge of the Devil to Almighty God then was that God could not put men on the earth who would remain faithful and true to Jehovah when subjected to severe persecution. (Job </span><span class="font2">2: 5) </span><span class="font3">In acknowledging that wicked challenge God </span><span class="font2">said </span><span class="font3">to the Devil: ‘For this cause have I permitted thee to remain [in existence], that I might show thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’—Ex. 9: 16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Two specific things, then, must come to pass : the name of Jehovah must be declared throughout the earth by his servants, and then he will exercise his supreme power against the Devil. Those persons who have voluntarily taken their stand on the side of God must therefore declare his name throughout the earth. This must be done before God exhibits his supreme power against all the wicked. The chief duty of the covenant people of God, therefore, is to bear testimony or witness to his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Every person who maintains his integrity toward Jehovah God must be a witness to the name of Jehovah and his government, The Theocracy. Every such person, therefore, is opposed by the Devil, the adversary of God and The Theocratic Government, and that wicked one sees to it that they are severely persecuted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> The hour has come in which every </span><span class="font2">person must </span><span class="font3">now declare himself either for or against Jehovah’s kingdom, because now is the day when all the nations are before the great Judge of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, who is separating the people, putting the approved on one side and those disapproved on the other. This is therefore the time of great crisis of the nations. If a person has taken his stand on the side of The Theocracy and declared himself for Jehovah and Christ, he must from that time forward expect to be persecuted by those who are of the world and who are therefore on the side of the Devil. The persecutors, therefore, compose the great mass of the people, because it is written: ‘The whole world lieth in the wicked one.’ (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.; Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> The wicked do not persecute one another who are wicked, but they do persecute those who de-elare the name of the righteous One, Jehovah, and his King. Which side of the great controversy between the wicked Satan and the righteous Almighty God have you taken? and on which side do you desire to remain ? If you are on the side of The Theocracy, then know for a certainty you will receive persecution at the hands of those who are against The Theocracy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PROOF</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” All persons who have taken and who declare the name of Jehovah God are witnesses for Jehovah. All witnesses for Jehovah are hated by the Devil and his agents. Take note of the unbroken line of proof: Abel was the first man who declared himself for Almighty God. Abel was persecuted by the Devil and murdered by the Devil’s agent. From the time of Abel to the last of God’s prophets, every one of his witnesses suffered violence at the hands of Satan and his agents. For the information of those who in this day are persecuted God caused a record of the persecution and life of those faithful men to be set out in the Bible at Hebrews the eleventh chapter, and, among other things, it is there recorded: “And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets; who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.”—Heb. 11: 32-34.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Those faithful men suffered all manner of persecution because they were for God’s kingdom and were diligent at all times to obey his commandments. Further concerning them it is written: “And others had trial of cruel Mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth/’—Vss. 36-38.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> All those faithful men died for the cause of righteousness. They were martyrs or witnesses to the name and kingdom of Almighty God. They were witnesses for Jehovah and consistently declared his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> Then came Jesus, the beloved Son of God. He is the one designated by the Lord Jehovah as “the faithful and true Witness” of Jehovah and whom God sent into the earth for the express purpose of proclaiming the truth of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom. (Rev. 1:5; 3:14; John 18:36,37) From the beginning of his earthly ministry until the end thereof he was reproached and cruelly persecuted by the Devil and his agents. For many centuries prior to the coming of Jesus the Devil had reproached the name of Jehovah, and therefore Jesus said: “For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”—Ps. 69: 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Jesus, “the faithful and true Witness,” suffered for righteousness’ sake, and of him it is written: “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.”—Isa. 53: 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Why should Jehovah God permit his beloved Son, who did no wrong, to be put to such great suffering? Jesus must prove his integrity toward God, and that under the most severe conditions, and thereby prove the Devil a liar; and thus he did by willingly and obediently suffering the greatest reproaches and indignities, and concerning the Lord Jesus it is written : “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto, all them that obey him.”—Heb. 5: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Mark now how closely the sufferings of the faithful prophets of old are related to the sufferings of Christ Jesus, and which establishes the rule that all who live godly must suffer persecution. (2 Tim. 3:12) Those faithful prophets specifically named at the eleventh chapter of Hebrews constitute a “cloud of witnesses” for Jehovah’s name, and these are held forth as proper examples of all persons who take their stand on the side of Jehovah. For the encouragement and comfort of all who have entered into a covenant to do the will of God these words are recorded, to wit: “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.”—Heb. 12:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> If one declares himself as having taken the side of The Theocracy and then attempts to escape persecution by declining or failing to bear testimony to the name of the great Theocrat and his King, that is further evidence that such a person is not a child of God but that he is on the side of the enemy and designated in the Scriptures as a ‘&quot;bastard”. God cannot be deceived. He knows the secret intent and purpose in the mind of each and every creature.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Today Jehovah’s witnesses are hated by all who are in opposition to the Theocratic Government of righteousness. They are hated because they declare the name of Jehovah God and of his King and kingdom. These facts are exactly in fulfillment of the prophecy uttered by the great Prophet, Christ Jesus. We are at the end of the world, and the words of that prophecy now specifically apply to all who are on the side of God and Christ, to wit: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.’’— Matt. 24:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Persecution of children and their parents by the enemies of The Theocracy is an endeavor to force both children and parents to violate their conscience and thus to fail to prove their integrity toward God, which would lead to their destruction. It is an effort on the part of the Devil and his agents to bring about the destruction of those who have declared themselves for Jehovah. The covenant people of God, therefore, must choose either to remain steadfast on the side of Jehovah and trust in him or to withdraw from their covenant and suffer destruction.—Josh. 24:15; Rom. 1: 31, 32; Heb. 10: 38, 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The anointed “remnant” are the willing servants of the Lord and joyfully declare the name of Jehovah, of Christ, and of the Kingdom. The Jonadabs, who will form the “great multitude”, have put themselves under the command of the Lord and are therefore his servants, and they join with the “remnant” in declaring the name of Jehovah and his King. Both the remnant and the Jonadabs, therefore, have taken the name of Jehovah and Christ. To all such the words of Jesus now apply, to wit: “Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.”—John 15: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Otherwise stated, if a person is on the side of the Lord and firmly remains there and maintains his integrity, he must openly and boldly declare the name of the great Theocrat and his King and must expect to suffer as Christ Jesus suffered. In thus proving his integrity he is certain to be the object of attack by Satan and by all those who are blindly doing the bidding of Satan, and that includes all the totalitarian states and those who are moved by the totalitarian or arbitrary spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The present is the day of tribulation upon the world. It is the time when the Devil continuously brings one woe after another woe upon the peoples of earth and when he is desperately fighting to destroy all who are on the side of the great Theocrat. (Rev. 12:12,17) Jesus specifically prophesied con-ceming this day of tribulation upon earth, and this tribulation he declares will reach a climax in “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, which battle of Armageddon is now very near. Did Jesus have in mind the present-day persecution of parents and their children! Without a doubt he did, because he prophesied furthermore in these words: “And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!” (Matt. 24:19) That prophecy has served as a warning to parents that both they and their children would suffer many woes at the hands of Satan and his agents in this day of tribulation. Probably many persons have overlooked this prophecy of the Lord and, although consecrated to do the will of God, they have expected some special favor to be shown to them and to their children by means of which they would be enabled to escape reproaches and persecution. This was an erroneous expectation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> But bear this in mind: that when a child reaches the age of understanding and intelligence, and intelligently takes his stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom, that child must prove his integrity toward Jehovah if he gains life everlasting. Therefore the child must be subjected to reproach and persecution and the parents also must likewise be subjected to reproach and persecution, because Satan will see to it that they get it, and the Lord permits it in order to afford an opportunity for such consecrated persons to prove their integrity toward him and thus prove Satan a liar.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> It is a cruel thing to take a child from the care and custody of its parents and put that child in the custody and control of a godless and religious institution. Such is directly contrary to the fundamental law of the land; but in this day laws are disregarded by those in power. It must be kept in mind that these are perilous times, when freedom has fallen to the earth and worldly governments are ruled by extremely vicious and cruel dictators. Such is true whether that nation be called “a republic” or “a Fascist government”. There is no means provided in this world to escape such cruel treatment unless the courts would sustain the fundamental law of the land, that which is guaranteed by the Constitution. When the courts fail to do this, the citizen has reached the end of his worldly remedy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Even though the child is forcibly and wrongfully taken from the parents because of the faithfulness of that child to keep its agreement to do the will of God, and the child is then placed in the custody of a religious institution, God can cause even that to operate for the good of the child and for the honor of His name. Little children are forceful witnesses to the name of God and to the Kingdom, and their testimony given before their custodians may well result to the honor of Jehovah’s name and enable the child to prove its integrity toward Jehovah God, resulting in everlasting life to the child and being a bright and shining light exposing the wickedness of this world and making manifest the goodness of Jehovah and the King. (See Daniel 1: 3-21.) There are many instances recorded in the Scriptures of children being witnesses for Jehovah, and in the present day children devoted to God can be more effective witnesses for the name and kingdom, of Jehovah than at any time past. (1 Sam. 3:1-18; Ps. 8: 2; Matt. 21:15,16; 2 Ki. 5:1-4; 2 Chron. 24:1-4; 34:1-4) The parents, therefore, have reason to rejoice with the children that they thus have the opportunity of bearing testimony to the name of God and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The all-important thing to do is to give the testimony to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. The perfect wisdom of the Lord directs the best way for his covenant people to take. Both the parents and the children must likewise keep in mind that the witnessing to the name of Jehovah and to the King and the Kingdom is the all-important thing and the great obligation laid upon them. When such faithful testimony brings upon the children and the parents reproaches and persecutions, then joyfully bear the same with the determination to remain true and steadfast to your covenant and prove faithful to Jehovah and to his King, and do this under all conditions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Each one must decide as to which side of the controversy he will take. On which side do you desire to be1 On which side would you have your children to be put and remain ? Of course, you will say, My desire for myself and my children is to be always on the side of Jehovah God and Christ his King. To have that desire, therefore, means that the ones receiving it must suffer reproaches and persecutions, by which reproaches and persecutions they advance into the Kingdom. Such reproaches and persecutions are therefore not worthy to be compared with the blessings that shall come to those who maintain their integrity toward God and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Everlasting life is the gift of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus, and that gift will be made only to those who maintain their integrity toward Jehovah God and his kingdom when put to the test Everlasting destruction is the result to all persons who are unfaithful to God and his King or who refuse to believe on and obey Jehovah and his King: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> Every one of the remnant and all of the Jona-dabs have chosen the side of Jehovah and his King, and in order to receive the approval of the great King and the blessings of life everlasting, such persons, both parents and children, must remain true and faithful to God and to his King. If the parents are separated from the children for a time, that will be only for a short time. If both parents and children remain true to Jehovah and to his King, then within a short time both parents and children will for ever have the blessings of living in peace and joy upon the earth together. The parents, therefore, should teach their children to remain true and faithful to God and to his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Remember, then, that the words of Jesus specifically apply in this present hour to all who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and his King, to wit: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matt. 24:13) These words apply now, beyond any question, and show that one must expect to be persecuted and must endure the same and remain faithful and true to God unto the very end. Be strong and very courageous, therefore, firmly and steadfastly remain on the side of the Lord, and give heed to these words of instruction, to wit: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”— Prov. 3: 5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">summary</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> The following, therefore, is a summary of the advice given to parents who inquire concerning what they shall do when their children are persecuted, as hereinbefore stated, to wit: If your child has voluntarily taken his or her stand on the side of Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, and conscientiously believes that, by indulging in the formal and religious salute of any flag, such is an act of idolatry committed in defiance and in violation of God’s law, then the child should be permitted to take the course that will prove its faithfulness to Jehovah and his King. If, because of this firm stand for its conscientious belief, the child is expelled from school, then let the parents and the children ask for an opportunity to take advantage of it and give a clear and emphatic testimony before the school board as to why the child takes that position, making it clear that both the children and the parents have the highest respect for the law of the land and for the flag, and the law for which it stands as a symbol, and will fully obey all laws of the land for which the flag stands and all laws that are not in violation of God’s law. Make it clear that the stand of the child is not stubbornness or any disposition to violate rules, but is faithfulness to God and to a covenant made with God to obey his will. At this testimony present the booklet named </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty</span><span class="font3"> and ask the school board to carefully peruse its pages. Submit other similar publications showing why one in a covenant with God must be faithful and true to the terms of that covenant. Then if the board decides against you, you have done your duty in bearing the testimony to the name of God and his kingdom and you can trust in the Lord for the final results.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” In taking this course both parents and children will be bearing testimony to the name of Almighty God and his kingdom, and that is the principal obligation laid upon such now. For many centuries faithful men and women have suffered because of their loyalty to Jehovah and his King. Follow their example and prove your integrity toward God and his King. If further punishment is inflicted upon the children because of their conscientious devotion to Jehovah God and his kingdom, then -the ones inflicting that punishment must bear the responsibility and answer to Almighty God and to his Executioner, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>86</sup> Let the school board be informed that the child is perfectly willing to stand mute and respectful while the religious ceremony of flag saluting proceeds or is willing to withdraw from the room for the time being; that there is no desire to oppose any rules; but where there is a conflict between the rules made by men and the emphatic rules made by Almighty God, then everyone in a covenant to do God’s will must follow the lead of the faithful apostles of Jesus Christ who said: ^Ve must obey God rather than men.’—Acts 5: 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” If the children are denied the benefits of the school for the reasons above assigned there is nothing more that can be done to compel their admission. If the parents are summoned into court to answer the charge that they are not fit persons to care for the children, then ask permission to there give testimony before the court, and show that the parents are devoted to righteousness, that they are endeavoring to obey the injunction of the Bible to bring up their child in the nurture and admonition of God; and then, if the court decides against you, wait on the Lord. The day of deliverance is near at hand, and that in the near future. Jehovah God has promised to avenge his own people, and that he is certain to do. “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them! I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth!” (Luke 18: 7, 8) Do you have such faith in God, that he will avenge those who are devoted to him! Not many will have such faith, as Jesus here indicates. Only those who are subjected to reproaches and persecution can prove that they have such faith. Prove it now by relying on the Lord, and know for a certainty that he will deliver you and your children in his due time and own good way.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> If legal proceedings are instituted to deprive the parents of the custody of the children and to put them in the custody of some religious institution, immediately notify the Society, addressing the Legal Desk, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, New York, and if there is anything possible that can be done we will attempt to do it in your behalf.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Bear in mind always that your chief obligation, which is laid upon you by the Lord, is to give a witness to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. Do so faithfully and trust in the Lord for protection, and his blessings will result. Be of good faith and be very courageous!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> What is the first or paramount obligation of the parents who are consecrated and in a covenant to do the will of God! Must they first obey every rule oi law of the land, even laws which are made and enforced in violation of God’s law, or is their first and paramount obligation to obey the law of Almighty God! Each person must choose for himself, and if he is really in a covenant to do God’s will he will be guided solely by the law of God; because it is written . “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&quot;—Ps. 119:105.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> All the faithful prophets of old chose to obey God rather than men, and all therefore willingly suffered death at the hands of men rather than to disobey God’s law. Christ Jesus, the only great man ever on earth, said to Jehovah: I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is written in my heart.’ (Ps. 40: 8) And again he said: “I came . . . , not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.’’ (John 6:38) Christ Jesus suffered the most ignominious death at the hands of religionists because he was faithful to Jehovah, always being obedient to His will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> The apostles of Jesus Christ strictly followed the lead of their Master, refusing to violate their covenant by obeying the laws of men; and when they were haled before the courts because of their obedience to God their reply was: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29) They too suffered persecution and martyrdom because of their faithfulness to their covenant and their obedience to God’s law After enduring all manner of persecution the faith ful and inspired apostle wrote: “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” (2 Tim. 3:12) That announced rule is unchangeable. Do you as a parent who is in a covenant to do God’s will, and whose children are likewise in a covenant to do his will, expect to receive for yourself and children blessings which God has provided for those who love him, and that without being subjected to persecution and suffering! “God is no respecter of persons” (Acts 10: 34), and makes no rules for any individuals or classes. His rules are unchangeable, and all who receive his approval must be obedient to his law, even though such obedience brings persecution and suffering to them. If persecutions and sufferings are conditions precedent to you and your children entering into life everlasting, because such is God’s fixed rule, then do not expect that the pathway that leads to life will be strewn with flowers and conditions of ease. The greatest gift that can come to man is life, and for that gift everyone must willingly meet the conditions which God has provided.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> One who has made a covenant with Jehovah God, thereby agreeing to do Jehovah’s will and to obey his law, must obey God’s law regardless of what men or nations may think or do about it. You may suffer much severe punishment because of that strict obedience to God’s law. You may be imprisoned and even put to death because of your full devotion and obedience to the law of Jehovah God. But do not fear such punishment. Men can only kill the body, but the Almighty God can destroy even the right to life and all possibility of life, which men cannot do. Those who because of their faithful devotion to God are put to death by men God will grant a full and complete resurrection to life, because he alone is the fountain of life and has the power of salvation and deliverance. (Pss. 36:9; 3:8) Therefore Jesus says to all who have made a covenant to do God’s will: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”—Matt. 10: 28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Democratic nations have for centuries recognized that the law of God is supreme and that no human law is of value that is contrary to God’s law. Recognized legal authorities have repeatedly written upon this matter, and which rule is summed up in the following words by legal writers: “The law of God is binding over all the globe, in all countries, at all times. No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from the original.” (Blackstone) “No external authority is to place itself between the finite being and the Infinite.”—Cooley’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Constitutional Limitations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> The Supreme Court of the United States, on former occasions, has held that the law of God is supreme. The Constitution of almost every state has so held. But, above all, we know that Jehovah God is supreme and that his law cannot be called in question by men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> But now a great change has come because we are at the end of the world, when Satan’s rule shall shortly cease for ever. Now cruel dictators, the agents of Satan, have completely supplanted democracies, because totalitarian rule is the instrument of the Devil. Now the Devil employs such to destroy all who are on the side of Jehovah and his </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">King</span>, because all the totalitarian rulers are against The </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy. Now all the nations are before the great Judge, Christ Jesus, where they are being judged. (Matt. 25:31-46) Now all persons may choose whom they will serve and to whom they will render full obedience. Obey Almighty God and live.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> Are the parents obligated to teach their children God’s Word of truth? God’s Word must be their guide and answers the question. (Ps. 119:105) To that question, in the scriptures as related to the governing of covenant people of God the emphatic answer is given: “And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”—Deut. 6: 5-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> The covenant people of Jehovah dare not turn away from their covenant and practice religion, because such is the product of Satan and the other demons and will result in their destruction: “Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”—Deut. 11: 16,18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">*’ Furthermore God’s Word specifically commands his covenant people: “And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” (Eph. 6:4) “Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is wellpleasing unto the Lord.” (Col. 3: 20) “Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart from it.”—Prov. 22: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>50</sup> God’s law is the law of life. No one can gain life who willingly violates God’s law. The most blessed heritage the parent can give his child is a knowledge of God’s Word, which shows that child the way to life. The parent who thus does his duty toward his children can fully trust the Lord to do for his children what the parent can not do. If, then, your children are taken away from you by cruel rules enforced against them because of the childrens' faithfulness to God, then rest content in the Lord, knowing full well that he will cause the same to work ultimately to the good of all such faithful ones. May it not be that the Lord will use your child or children to bear witness to his name before others who think themselves of great importance and possessing great authority? May not your children be used to put such men to shame or to confound them when the crucial test comes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ The child Jesus, when only twelve years of age, sat with the doctors or mighty religious leaders and by his expressed wisdom confounded them and put them to shame. (Luke 2:46-48) Other children have been named in the Bible as serving God with his approval. When the man Jesus was on earth conditions were exactly similar to those of the present time. Then the “wise and prudent” men, wise in their own eyes, were the great religious leaders, but were in fact in darkness as to God’s purposes. Likewise today the great religious leaders are in the dark as to Jehovah’s purposes, while the truth of his purpose is revealed to little children. Now are appropriate the words of the Psalm, which Jesus repeated and which apply both to the ancient and to the present time, to wit: “0 Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies; that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.” (Ps. 8:1,2) “In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.”—Luke 10: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>52</sup> Today the child of ten years or less which has been instructed in the Word of God can readily teach and easily confound the religious “wise men” of this world, because such children are taught according to God’s Word. Have faith that God will see to it that your child, if faithful to him, will be protected from harm and will be used by him to witness to his name and to his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ The religious institutions of the world, which claim to be Christian but which are not, are designated in the prophecies under the symbol “Jerusalem”, which Jerusalem was and is unfaithful to God. The prophet of Jehovah, at God’s command, makes the following record: “For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem, and from Judah, the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water, the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.”—Isa. 3:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>53</sup> Today God has taken away from all “Christendom", which is modern Jerusalem, all true bread and water, that is, all life-giving and life-sustaining food of truth. Instead of these religionists being fed and now being aides to the people, God has given the bread and water of life to little children that stand firm for God and his government, that the children may aid others. If such children continue faithful until and through Armageddon, they shall be forever with the faithful prophets of old, who shall be “princes in all the earth”. (Ps. 45:16; Isa. 32:1) Now' your child stands above the mighty ones of earth because God’s favor is to those who love and serve him faithfully and truly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>54</sup> If your children should be torn from your parental care and love, bid them as they go to always remain true, faithful and steadfast unto Jehovah God and Christ his King; to continuously pray to God and Christ to give them protection and use them in the service of the great Theocracy and to cause them at all times to do the will of the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Almighty</span> God. Then rest in the Lord and wait for his complete deliverance. (Ps. 44:4) That blessed day is near at hand! —Luke 21: 28, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ON &quot;GOING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">H</span><span class="font2">EAVEN is the habitation of the great Creator of the universe, Jehovah God, the Most High. He caused to be written in his Word: “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.” (Isa. 66:1) That means that heaven is more lofty and exalted than the earth. Jehovah God is the self-existing and immortal One. Concerning him it is written, at 1 Timothy 6:16, that Tie only hath immortality, dwelling in the light, whom no man hath seen, nor ever can see’. The reason is that God is the great spirit Being and man is a human creature. By his prophet Isaiah Jehovah declares that he made the earth for man and He made man for the earth. (Read Isaiah 45:12,18.) God formed man out of the elements of the earth, and hence it is written that man is of the earth, and earthy. An earthly creature, therefore, could not inhabit heaven. If he ever goes to heaven he must be changed from a human to a spirit creature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark9"></a>TO HEAVEN”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The organism or body of man is flesh, and the life of man is in the blood, according to God’s declaration at Genesis 9: 4 and Leviticus 17:11. “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” It is so stated at 1 Corinthians 15: 50. The doctrine universally taught to the people by so-called “organized Christianity” is that all good men, women and children do at death go to heaven. There being so many branches and divisions of so-called “organized Christianity”, the religious elergy in their desire to keep the people in the proper attitude say to them: ‘It matters not to which one of the churches you belong, just so you belong to one. We are all traveling different roads, but to the same goal, and that is heaven.’ This conclusion of theirs is based upon the false doctrine of the inherent immortality of the human soul and of all souls, including the Devil. The teaching is in substance this: That death does not mean cessation of living existence, but merely the transition from</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">one condition of life on earth to a condition of life either in heaven or in hell. So far as “orthodox” religion is concerned, earth is merely a breeding place or an incubator to produce and nourish creatures for one or the other of two places, hell or heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To illustrate: A man of a community who has been successful in business and been a member of some church organization and who has rendered public service to the people and contributed large sums of money to the poor, ends his earthly course in death. At his funeral the clergyman unhesitatingly tells those who hear that this man was a good man and that he is not dead but that he has passed immediately into heaven. The listening people are induced to believe his statement, and many do believe it. The statement of the clergyman, however, is wholly unsupported by the Word of God, and therefore is untrue. If the man just described is classed as a “good man” and, according to the clergy, goes immediately to heaven, then it follows that heaven must be full of like men who have lived and died. However, the man thus described is not “good” within the meaning of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bible shows that Abel, Enoch, Abraham, Isaac and all of God’s prophets received his approval. (Read Hebrews 11:1-39.) They died faithful to God. Concerning King David of Jerusalem, one of these prophets, it is even written that he was a man after God’s own heart. (Acts 13:22) Those men not only did good to the people, but were faithfully devoted to God and to his righteous cause. They all died, but not one of them went to heaven or ever can be in heaven. Some of them died practically three thousand years before Jesus was on earth. According to the teachings of the orthodox clergy, all those men must have gone to heaven, and they cite you for proof to the scene of Jesus’ transfiguration on the mountaintop, when Moses and Elijah appeared, but which Jesus plainly said was but a “vision”. (Matt. 17:9) According to the testimony of Jesus, who spoke with authority, not one of those faithful men went to heaven. You must choose whom you will believe, clergymen or the Bible. In his conversation with the Jewish ruler Nicodemus Jesus said: “No man hath ascended up to heaven.” (John 3:13) This is conclusive proof that not one of them went to heaven. Even though David was a man after God’s own heart, and had God’s approval, yet the inspired apostle Peter, on the day of Pentecost, ten days after the ascension of Jesus to heaven, declared, at Acts 2:34: “David is not ascended into the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus named John the Baptist as a prophet than whom none greater had risen of all them that be born of women. God selected John to be the announcer of The Messiah, The Christ, and John was faithful and true to his commission and suffered martyrdom because of his faithfulness to Jehovah God. Concerning John, Jesus said: “He that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he [John].” (Matt. 11:11) The reason that these good and faithful men did not go to heaven and never can be in heaven is plainly set forth in the Bible and enables one to see clearly what is required to take place before one of the human race can be taken to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Bible is consistent: every part thereof is in harmony with every other part. The proper understanding of the Bible makes clear the purpose of Jehovah God. Man is a human creature; and since no human creature can enter heaven, which is the habitation of the spirit creatures, then it follows that a man could not enter heaven without being changed from human to spirit. Jesus spoke with authority and he said to Nicodemus: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. . . . Except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.” (John 3:3, 5, 6) In other words, in order for a man to go to heaven he must be born of the spirit and become a spirit creature. The faithful men of old, from Abel to John the Baptist, died before the day of Pentecost, when the spirit was poured out upon those devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ. Prior to that, “the holy spirit was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.” —John 7:39; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The statement by the clergy and other orthodox supporters that there are many roads leading to heaven is utterly false and is not supported by any scripture in the Bible. God has pointed out in his Word one way, and just one, by which the man may in due course enter the heavenly realm. This is so important that we cannot afford to accept the opinions of any man upon the question. The Bible alone is the authority upon which we must rely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When Adam, the first man, was sentenced to death because of turning to religion and breaking the law of God, Jehovah announced then and there His purpose to bring forth from his universal organization (symbolized by “the woman”) a “seed”, which would be used as God’s chief instrument for the establishment of righteousness on earth and to bring believing man back into harmony with Himself. (Gen. 3:15) That seed is Christ Jesus, and those who become the faithful members of “the body of Christ” are by adoption made a part of that seed and all together constitute the heavenly kingdom, “the kingdom of heaven.” The seventh and fourteenth chapters of The Revelation are authority for the statement that there will be only 144,000 and One of that specially favored and elect Kingdom class. The One is Christ Jesus and the 144,000 are his associates and members of “his body”, “the church.” These will be of the Kingdom, while at the same time there will be visible princes on the earth, to wit, the resurrected faithful men of old, who will be the visible human representatives of that invisible Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus the King. All those of the invisible heavenly kingdom “must be born again”, as Jesus told Nicodemus.—Read Revelation 7:1-8; 14:1-4; John 3:7; also Isaiah 32:1; Psalm 45:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus became a man that he might bear witness to Jehovah’s name and His Theocratic Government and also that he might be qualified to pay the ransom price and redeem from death all men that believe and obey. It was the will of God that Jesus should take this course, and Jesus gladly and faithfully complied with God’s will. In Philippians, the second chapter, it is recorded that because of his faithfulness to God in the performance of the covenant to do the will of God, Jehovah raised up Jesus out of death and made him the Head of the heavenly kingdom class and appointed him to the position of Jehovah’s Chief Executive Officer for ever. Never before that time was it possible for any man to go to heaven. The man Christ Jesus was the first</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">one to be changed from human to a spirit creature. Hence it is written of him, at Colossians 1:18,19: “He is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.” Christ Jesus was the first creature ever to get immortality, and this he was given by Jehovah at his resurrection. As Jesus stated: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” (John 5:26) After his resurrection he said: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.”—Rev. 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Concerning Jesus and his resurrection and appearing in heaven it is written, at 2 Timothy 1: 9,10: “Grace . . . was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[{Douay Version)</span><span class="font2"> life and incorruption] to light through the gospel.” Before that there was no way open for man to have everlasting life, and no possibility for any man ever to have immortality or ever get to heaven. These facts are set forth so plainly in the Scriptures that there is no excuse for any real student of the Bible to be misled concerning the truth thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After Jesus’ resurrection and ascension into heaven the way was opened for man to enter that way to heaven, and then God began to take out from amongst men those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus in the kingdom of heaven. Only those living on earth at that time, or who would live on earth thereafter, could possibly be of the heavenly class, and these must meet the conditions or requirements of God before they could be taken to heaven. To these 144,000 Jesus says: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” —Luke 12: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A rich ruler came to Jesus and asked him what he should do to inherit eternal life. He told Jesus that he had been obedient to the law of God in every respect. Jesus then said to the ruler: 'What you lack now-is this: You must sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.’ What Jesus really meant was that the affection of this man should cease to be attached to things earthly, and his devotion and allegiance should be to God, because that was the course that Jesus took.—Read the record at Luke 18:18-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To his disciples Jesus said: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” (Matt. 16:24, 25) No man would do what Jesus here says unless he believes in God and in Christ as the great Redeemer. These scriptures therefore prove that in order to make even a start to go to heaven a man must first believe that God is the Rewarder of those that diligently seek Him and serve Him, and that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer and Savior of man. Then the man must commit himself to the will of God by agreeing to do God’s will as he learns it. Before he could do these things he must have some faith, and faith comes only by having a knowledge of God’s purposes and then by relying upon God’s Word. To say that a man can believe anything he wants to and reach heaven is worse than error. It is clearly misleading, and destructive of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The individual’s agreement to do God’s will is not made with man, but each one .must make it with the Lord God This agreement is made only by those who have and who exercise faith in God and in Christ. If God is pleased to do so, He makes a covenant with the one thus showing his faith; and this is called a “covenant by sacrifice”. (Ps 50:5), because it is an agreement to do God’s will and it leads to the sacrifice of everything that is earthly, and this particularly includes the right of the man to live on earth. No one can decide to go to heaven without sacrificing for ever his right to live as a human creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God then gives his word of promise that such a one shall have the right to live as a spirit creature and, if faithful to his covenant, shall live forever in heaven. In James 1:18 it is written. “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” The word “begat” used here means to bring forth and to acknowledge as a son, that is, the Father acknowledges that the one so brought forth is the son of God. The one thus brought forth is just now starting in the heavenly way. If he faithfully performs his part of the covenant he will receive a complete change in the resurrection from human to spirit life. (See 1 Corinthians 15:35-54.) God considers the consecrated, spirit-begotten one a spirit creature from the time he is brought forth, because he must live, if at all, as a spirit creature. Since no human creature can ever be of the heavenly kingdom, it follows, then, that God would not call any human creature to heaven or offer him a place in heaven. All those who are “called” or invited by Jehovah to heaven are called after they become the sons of God, being brought forth, as just stated. All those brought forth receive the call, but the Scriptures show that only a few are chosen for the heavenly kingdom. “Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus.” (Heb. 3:1) Many do not respond to the call. “For many are called, but few are chosen.” (Matt. 22:14) Those who do not respond to the call by seeking the Kingdom and proving themselves faithful and trug witnesses of Jehovah even unto death are never chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who do respond to the call for the Kingdom, and who thereafter become unfaithful or lawless, iniquitous, suffer everlasting destruction. At his coming to the temple, “the Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 13:41,42) Concerning those found to be unfaithful, evil servants, at his coming to the temple, Jesus prophesied: “That evil servant . . . the lord of that servant shall . . . cut him asunder [from His organization], and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 24: 48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Those who respond to the call for the kingdom of heaven and who devote themselves unequivocally and wholly to God and to his Theocratic Government under Christ, and who continue faithful and are found faithful by the great Judge Christ Jesus, are chosen and anointed to perform a special work while on earth, and if this work as a witness of Jehovah is done faithfully to the end, such ones shall be members of the heavenly kingdom. In this connection Jesus said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.” (Matt. 7:21) But how may a man know what is God’s will!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The will of God man learns from the Bible. Among other things it is written that the will of God is that all who have a part in the heavenly kingdom must overcome the world. To his followers Jesus said (John 16:33): “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” He told his disciples that they must do likewise; they must “overcome the world”. “The world&quot; means the organization of peoples of the earth which rule over the earth and which organization is under the supervision and direct influence and control of the invisible overlord, Satan the Devil.-John 12:31; 2 Cor. 4:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To “overcome the world” means that one must take his stand on the side of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under Christ, be obedient to God’s will, and refuse to have any part in the affairs of the world. At James 4: 4 it is written: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God! whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” Here “adultery” is used in a symbolic manner, and means the illicit or wrongful co-operation with the rulers of this world by one who professes to be a Christian. It means that the man who participates in the politics or rulership of this world, whether he be a clergyman or a financier, and who shows he is a friend to the world by upholding its schemes, cannot be pleasing to God, but is classed as God’s enemy. He might be a very moral man and have a good name and reputation amongst his neighbors; but that is not sufficient. Mere morality, chastity and honesty, and doing good deeds to one’s neighbor, are not a passport into heaven, by any means. The real Christian must be all of this and much more. He must be entirely for God and his Theocratic cause, must seek to know God’s will as found in His Word, and then must faithfully do it. This he accomplishes by faith in Christ Jesus as his Redeemer, and in God as his great Benefactor. Therefore it is written concerning the Christian : “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” (1 John 5:4) No man will take this course and go on to victory unless he has absolute faith in Jehovah God and demonstrates that faith by works of obedience. No man can have this faith without some knowledge of God’s way and purpose; and God has but one way, not many, and that way is not found in any part of the so-called “organized Christianity” on earth, with its many forms of religion, which is demonism.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark11"></a>’’ACT OF GOD”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">R</span><span class="font2">EPORTS the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font2"> of November 11: “Sunday’s catastrophic earthquake in Rumania achieved more for the cause of British arms than any military action thus far in the war. The ‘act of God’ crippled seriously Rumania’s already inadequate transport, razed bridges which it would have taken an army to destroy, and wrought havoc in oil fields upon which Germany is now almost wholly dependent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Courts of law and law writers define an “act of God” as “an inevitable accident against which ordinary care and prudence could not guard; the interruption of the ordinary course of events such as is not to be looked for in advance”. Are such things as the above the result of God’s acts ? No, they are not; and the claim that such thing constitutes the act of God is entirely without Scriptural authority. God is therefore wrongfully charged with such calamities. Such are properly chargeable against Satan the Devil. That Satan has power to produce storms and like unusual things cannot be doubted, and is proved by the Scriptures. (Eph. 2:2; 2 Cor. 4:4; Heb. 2:14; Luke 8: 23-25) But why should Satan bring storms and like disasters upon the people and cause them to charge the responsibility up to God! The reason is that Satan has always tried to induce men to curse Jehovah God. If the people could be made to understand that Jehovah God is responsible for these disasters they would hate rather than love him, and this Satan well knows; hence his course of action. —Job 1: 6-22 ; 2:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To appreciate the above we must get the proper understanding of the great question at issue. When Satan rebelled against God he induced man to sin by introducing religion to man and telling man that God is a liar. Satan then defied Jehovah God, saying that no man could be put on the earth who under great stress would be faithful to God. In order that all creation might in due time be fully convinced that Jehovah is the only true God, from whom blessings come, Jehovah permitted Satan to go his full limit in wickedness. In due time Jehovah will destroy Satan and all his power, and this by means of his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. For this reason the book of Job is written in the Bible. The record is that Job was a very rich man who served God faithfully amidst great prosperity. Satan declared he could compel Job to curse God, and so he was permitted to try it. Satan brought a great windstorm which destroyed Job’s house and killed all his children and most of his servants. Then Satan brought other calamities upon Job. He afflicted Job with boils and then brought three pious-faced religionists who claimed to be Job’s friends and who by false accusations tormented Job for days. Satan also induced Job’s wife to call upon him to curse God and die. Amidst all this Job remained true and faithful to God, and Satan failed in his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For the same purpose Satan has caused the people to be taught for many centuries that all the storms, the bugs, and insects, and like things that bring disaster upon the people, come because the people have not contributed to the religious organization and been faithful to it, and hence God is displeased with them and sends calamities. Thereby many persons have been induced to curse God and turn away from him. In due time Jehovah God will bring to pass events that will surely convince all creation that Satan is the wicked deceiver and that Jehovah God is the Giver of life and happiness to those that serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What, then, is the proper explanation of the words “act of God”! The Bible truly says that all the works of Jehovah are perfect, and that all his ways are good and just, right and true. (Deut. 32:4) “God is love”; which means he is entirely unselfish. He does punish wickedness and declares he will completely destroy the willfully wicked. This he has done, and will do, for the honor of his name and for the good of those who love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of Adam’s willing disobedience Jehovah God sentenced him to death, expelled him from Eden and put him tn death. Adam’s children, acting with the host of Nephilim or demons under Satan, filled the earth with violence. (Gen. 6: 4, 5, II, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font2"> God sent a great deluge and destroyed all flesh upon the earth except Noah and his. immediate family, who were faithful to God. That great deluge was an act of God; but before God performed it he gave full notice, so that it could not be said that it was an “inevitable accident against which ordinary care and prudence could not guard”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under the rulership of Pharaoh and his associates the Devil-worshiping Egyptians greatly oppressed God’s chosen people, the Israelites. These cried unto Jehovah and He led them out of Egypt by the hand of Moses. When the Egyptian army pursued the Israelites for the purpose of destroying them, God destroyed the Egyptians in the Red sea. That was an act of Ged. It was not, however, an inevitable accident against which the Egyptians could not guard and about which they could not know, because God had previously by Moses given full notice to the Egyptians of his purpose to punish them if his people were further persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Jews, once God’s chosen people, turned away from his law and worship and to religion, the snare of the Devil. They were unfaithful to their covenant with Jehovah God and became idolatrous. In due time Jehovah God permitted the armies of Babylon to lay siege to Jerusalem and to cause millions of the religious people to die by the sword, by famine and pestilence, and the city and its temple to be completely destroyed in 606 B.C. That was an act of God, but it was not an inevitable accident that could not be looked for in advance and against which prudent men could not guard themselves. On the contrary, Jehovah God did, over a period of 150 years, send his prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel and others to the Jews and gave them full warning of his purpose to punish them for their wickedness; and in due time he did punish them. Therefore, an “act of God” is not, as defined by worldly wise men, ‘an inevitable accident that cannot be looked for in advance.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Scriptures conclusively prove that God never takes advantage of his enemies by bringing upon them a disaster which they could not know of in advance. This is further proof that all such calamities not forewarned of are from Satan, the enemy of God. Satan causes these to be charged against God for the very purpose of turning the people away from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now the Scriptures make it dear that another great and mighty act of God shall soon come to pass, which act was prefigured by the great deluge. The Scriptures describe it as “his strange act”, and add that in the progress thereof the wisdom of the worldly wise men shall perish. “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. Now, therefore, be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong.” (Isa. 28:21,22) By the words of his prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel God declares He will completely wreck “Christendom” and all of Satan’s organization and that there will be so many dead persons as the result of his “strange act” that the living will not be able to Miry them. By his prophet Habakkuk the Lord tells of how he will march his heavenly hosts through the land and desolate it and that he will thresh the nations in his anger and that so terrible will be the spectacle and power of Jehovah God exhibited that the sun and the moon shall stand still, and then all shall know it is the act of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That great act of Jehovah God at Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” will not be as the worldly wise men have defined it: ‘an inevitable accident against which prudent persons cannot guard.’ Particularly since A.D. 1918 Jehovah God has been sending his witnesses throughout the land with his message of warning to “Christendom”, telling of the great and terrible “strange act” that is just ahead. That message of warning he has caused to be printed in millions of books, in many languages, and to date these have been given a distribution of more than 335 millions of copies throughout the earth, not including the hundreds of millions of copies of free tracts and of magazines, such as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> God is causing notice now to be served upon the rulers, and particularly upon the religious clergy, in order that their mouths may be for ever estopped from saying that ‘there came upon us an inevitable disaster which we as prudent men could not know about in advance’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Responsibility is upon Jehovah’s witnesses to now take this message of warning to the people, and then the responsibility is upon those to whom it is brought to give due and proper consideration to that message. Refusing to hear it and destroying the books that contain the message will furnish no excuse to anyone to ever say he did not know that this great “act of God” was about to be performed. Armageddon is rapidly approaching, and Jesus described it as the greatest trouble that ever came upon the world or ever will come. Both Jesus and other prophets of God declared that people of good-will and honest heart who hear and heed the warning and take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ will be preserved and taken through the trouble. So, be wise and give a hearing ear. May it please you to do so and receive the protection find blessings of Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEER SHOWS COPS HOW IT’S DONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;A police car drove up with two officers and a town official. The officers were very courteous, but not so the town official. One officer asked what we were doing. I replied we were preaching the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom as commanded, and handed him my identification card, also explaining to him the manner in which our work was carried on from door to door. One officer then said to the town official that if we were selling the books he would bring us in. At my suggestion the officers were invited to come along with us and see just how the work was being done; to which they agreed. The three then left. About half an hour later the two officers returned, with a third one, on a motorcycle; this last officer being the one assigned to accompany me in my work. For more than an hour this officer and I went from house to house and door to door, climbing the stairs. At one place a lady became enraged at the Kingdom message and the officer explained to her that I was within my legal rights in doing this work and there was nothing wrong with it. She quickly calmed down and thanked the officer for his explanation. This officer also was very friendly. When he left he asked for my name and address, stating he would have to make some kind of report that our work was all right. One week later, while returning to my car after making a back-call, an officer (not one of the three mentioned above) stopped his car next to mine and said, Wou’ve got my mother now,’ and smiled. I said, ‘Yes, how’s that?’ He replied: ‘A few weeks ago she got some pamphlets and read them; now all you can hear is Jehovah'; and with a friendly smile he drove off.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“She read the testimony card, and without asking to see the book she dashed inside and brought the shilling and took the book. Said she: ‘We had the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font2"> some years ago and read it, and when the war broke out my husband and I turned up this book and realized that its contents were true.’ Of course, we had a good talk together and in course of conversation I told her of the lecture recordings, which resulted in an appointment for Sunday a week in the evening. On arrival at call we found twenty persons assembled, mostly young folk. Recordings were put on, and we had question after question. All expressed their appreciation after meeting, and a further appointment was made. We went again last night (Sunday evening). Twenty-one present! More recordings, more questions, very pointed ones, and pointed answers. One asked what we thought of spiritualism, and we pointed out that this was demonism, referring to the Scriptures. There was a chorus of approval to the answer. After meeting, a man from a neighboring city, who had been present, said he was very interested and had we been spiritists he would have walked out. He is very keen and gave us his address and wants to get in touch with the local organization where he is living. I have written the company servant at Stoke, so that he can get in touch with him. All expressed their appreciation, and we are arranging for a further meeting. The lady of the house says she would sooner have these meetings in her home than go to church, and they are discerning the difference between religion and Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AT THE THEOCRATIC CONVENTION (ENGLAND)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A smiling young man approached me inside the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, and said, ‘Do you come from Newcastle (Staffs.)?’ I nodded. He asked if I recognized him-, which I did not, although the face was recalled. Then he reminded me that two years ago I called at his house in Birmingham and left a book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> At the time he refused to contribute for the book and was critical and skeptical. Because he seemed to be of good-will and intelligent the book was left with him on this understanding: that if he found the message valuable and true he would post one shilling to my address (which was left with him, but subsequently lost). On reading the book he found, to his great surprise, the answers to his problems, and immediately got in touch with the local friends at the Kingdom Hall For over a year he has been a publisher of Jehovah’s kingdom and is now the territory servant for Birmingham Central Unit. He always regretted losing my name and address and inquired often the identity of the witness who originally called on him. Nobody could tell him, but at Manchester convention he at once recognized me and we both rejoiced together. What a thrill I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WITNESSING AFTER MOB ACTION (ELSINORE, CALIF.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I asked God’s guidance. I parked car in the middle of the block near where mob action occurred. Two of the children watched our whereabouts. I took the third, wife took the fourth child. Soon I saw the police car driving up and down the street. They stopped to examine my car, which has a sign on the back ‘Give Praise to Jehovah’. We carried right on, from house to house. The cop questioned the children, then drove up to me, asked my name, and, ‘Where is your permit?’ ‘I do not need a permit.’ ‘You are selling books; your boy offered to sell me one for 25c.’ I told him we receive contribution for literature. Officer next to driver: ‘Why do you carry carnal weapons ?’ I said, ‘That is a lie!’ Cop: ‘A short time ago when they had a mob here, some of Jehovah’s witnesses carried carnal weapons.’ ‘Did you see them yourself?’ ‘Someone told me so.’ ‘And you believed him? If I tell you the truth, you do not believe me.’ I asked him if he ever read the Bible. ‘I have several Bibles. I believe the Bible, but that crap you are peddling I do not care for. Why don’t you salute the flag and be a good citizen ?’ I referred him to Exodus 20: 3-5 and other scriptures; and, ‘as being a good citizen, I raised eight children and paid over $400 taxes last year. That might be more than you did for the country.’ Cop at wheel: ‘What is your age? [52] Where were you born?’ In Rumania.’ ‘Have you your citizenship papers?’ ‘I have my first papers.’ ‘When did you get them?’ ‘A few years ago.’ Officer next to driver again referred to that crap I was peddling. I told him it was not crap; it is announcing Jehovah’s kingdom. ‘Who is Jehovah?’ ‘He is the Most High over all the earth.’ Cop: ‘Rutherford’s name is on that booklet; what is that for?’ I replied: ‘Suppose you were accused of being a thief or “fifth columnist”, you would want to clear yourself of that charge.’ The cop at the wheel looked all through the booklet: ‘Can I have this booklet?’ ‘Yes, if you read it.’ I offered one to cop next to him; he had no use for it. I asked him for his name, but he must have been ashamed of it. They drove off, and we went right on, placing 13 bound books </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> and 23 booklets, in four hours.”</span></p>
