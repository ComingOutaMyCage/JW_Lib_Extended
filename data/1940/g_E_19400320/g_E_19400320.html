<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Convention Report</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">TESUS foretold this day when the “great multitude” would come from the east and west to sit down by the side of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who together pictured The Theocracy. (Matthew 8: 11) To those who are now privileged to witness the increase of this great, swelling army, the fulfillment of the prophecy is thrilling beyond expression. The sight of those coming now to seek salvation under the protection of the Lord’s organization was dramatically exemplified at the recent zone assembly in Long Beach, California, February 9-11. This was not really a convention, but only a joint meeting of Zones 1, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2 and</span><span class="font10"> 5 of the state of California. But those of the remnant and of their companions, the “great multitude”, heard of this assembly which was to be addressed by Judge Rutherford, and came from all parts of the west, Canada, and Mexico. The people of Los Angeles and Long Beach, who received an invitation to the assembly by means of wide advertisement and publicity, which was carried on without the aid of any newspaper, also swarmed to the congregation of the Lord’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The climax of the meeting was the public address by Judge Rutherford, on Sunday, at 3 p.m., in the Municipal Auditorium, on the subject “The Theocracy”. An audience of 8,000 people heard this wonderful message from the Lord in breathless attention. A thousand more people were turned away from this beautiful auditorium, picturesquely located on the beaeh of the Pacific ocean. No auditorium has ever been large enough, in Los Angeles county, when Judge Rutherford speaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the remnant decreases in the earth and the “great multitude” sweeps up in numbers, the message of the Lord is more particularly addressed to that company who shall fill the earth with a righteous race. How intently this audience, chiefly composed of the Jonathan class, or “multitude”, heard the speaker describe The Theocracy in the thrilling phrase of the Scriptures! There was realization in their faces that what they heard was lifegiving truth informing them of the purposes of the Almighty to sustain them in this hour of peril and need. “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.” (Psalm 3: 8, A.R.7.) It was a marvelous sight to see the remnant and the Jona-dabs gathered together in unity.-Psalm 133: </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Judge Rutherford’s speech was not delivered entirely by manuscript, as is compulsory in radio addresses, but it was a heart-to-heart speech delivered with all the fire and emphasis that was possible in appealing to those of reasonable minds that they might seek the Lord’s place of safety. Those joyous people, hearing the Lord’s way of salvation, were a sight never to be forgotten. Clearly it was outlined to them how religion has been the snare which Satan has used to blind the people. Another thrill came when it was pointed out that soon the Hierarchy’s chief potentate would arrange for peace, claim all the credit therefor, and then would sudden destruction come .upon the Hierarchy and their whole gang. “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” (1 Thessalonians 5: 3) This great message of Jehovah was the soul-satisfying feast for the hungry Lazarus company, many of whom had been held in subjection by the religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Long Beach is fortunate to have some real men among its citizens, who have not forgotten that this country was founded to give freedom to the oppressed. When the manager of the Municipal Auditorium was appealed to to rent the building for the assembly, he answered in this phrase: “Who? Jehovah’s witnesses want to come here for convention? Are you not the people that had trouble with the Coughlinites at Madison Square Garden? </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">You </span><span class="font10">can’t rent this auditorium; we will give it to you free for three days, because you are the kind of people we want in this town.” And despite the Catholic Hierarchy’s usual methods of intimidation, in which they had endless telephone calls relayed to this freedom-loving manager, he stuck by his word and told this bunch of totalitarians to &quot;go jump in the creek”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There were other real men in Long Beach. It is said that the city has recently had a change in official personnel, a Catholic mayor and governing group having been replaced by some red-blooded Americans. When the priests got their parishioners and other suckers to call up the chief of police and the mayor, asking them to stop Jehovah's witnesses, they got little satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only effect that opposition to the Lord’s message has is merely to advertise it the more. In his address Judge Rutherford called attention to the tactics of the Hierarchy in thus trying to prevent the people from hearing the truth; and so five or six thousand of the public from Long Beach and vicinity heard the exposure of this gang, and their disgust was increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other features of the assembly were service discourses both in Spanish and in English and a model </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font10">study was a revelation to many in the amount of ground covered in less than an hour. Brief opening and closing comments were made by the chairman, the salient points of the entire December 15 </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> were considered, more than thirty questions asked and answered, thirty-six paragraphs were read; and this was completed with accurate answering of all questions, requiring no additional comment by the chairman, in less than sixty minutes. This accomplishment did not permit of any “windjamming'’. On Sunday morning 226 were immersed, 5,500 books and booklets were placed, besides 1,171 individual copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> during the convention ; attendance at phonograph setups and sound-car recordings was 4,019, besides those present at the meetings. All went home rejoicing at another victory for Jehovah.— Written by one who was present.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Watchtower</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Distributors Arrested</span></h3>
<p><span class="font19">F</span><span class="font10">IVE young men, eager to bear to others the vital truths now due to go to the people, stationed themselves on a busy street intersection in Brooklyn, New York, on Saturday, February 24, and offered passers-by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> magazines, at the same time calling out, with great plainness of speech, “Religion is a. snare and a racket” or &quot;Read the truth about religion and see for yourself that it is the world’s biggest racket”, and similar other arresting observations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They were entirely within their rights in so doing, not only on the basis of the Word of God, but also on the basis of confirmatory decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, which, in opinions handed down in the Schneider case and the Lovell </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">r.</span><span class="font10"> City of Griffin decision, made it clear that no one can be stopped from spreading papers, pamphlets, magazines or other literature, on the streets or elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whether the policeman on the job in this instance knew this or not, he understood that something uncomplimentary was being said about religion. His name was Leahy. So he arrested the young men, all of them, forgetting that the United States is a democracy and that, freedom of speech and of the press is one of the most jealously guarded rights of the American people. He had sworn to uphold these rights and be loyal to them, and defend them with his life—but no matter. Here was something he felt must be stopped. But the end was not yet. He had to appear in court and explain matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the cases were tried he was placed on the stand, and when asked whether he was a Roman Catholic he sort of hated to admit it, but said softly, “Yes.” When asked to state why he had arrested these young men, he said that they had shouted too loud. Would he demonstrate just how loud they had shouted &quot;Religion is a snare and a racket”? He tried, but. something stuck in his throat, and the demonstration was far from convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then he was asked if it. was not true that “Coughlin’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Social Justice</span><span class="font10"> magazine” was regularly distributed at the same location. “Yes,” that, was true. But. he had not arrested any of those who distributed that inflammatory periodical. Was he then a member of “The</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christian Front”? He turned red, but said “No”. The attorneys for the Watchtower distributors then saw to it that the record of the ease included a statement as to the exact reason for opposition to the work of proclaiming the truth of the Kingdom of God. They were aware that the Kingdom publishers were not chiefly concerned about their personal liberation from restraint. They wanted to give a testimony to the praise of Jehovah’s name; for the honor of that name, and not their personal liberty, was the issue. The judge on the bench at first wished to exclude such testimony, not appreciating the situation fully.- But he was a just judge, and, mindful of the fact that these young men had been put to considerable inconvenience, he permitted their attorneys to include a statement of the real reason both for their work and for the opposition of the clergy (who were'back of the policeman), A complete record having been made, the judge dismissed the case, with the statement that the workers of the Watchtower were entirely within their rights, that it was perfectly apparent that their ideals were of the highest, that they were not criminals, and that police officers, instead of interfering, should protect them in their work. The judge stated, “These men will give their life for this work; our country would be better off if there were more men like that, as they are very rare in these days.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>American Railroads</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">AM a railroad man, and I wonT ^er whether you know that'approx-/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imately 16,000 passenger trains are</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">operated in the United States, and somewhere in the land a train is either starting or ending a trip every five seconds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the ears and locomotives owned by the railroads of the United States, if coupled together, would make a train nearly 20,000 miles in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a year, the railroads carry approximately 500 million passengers, or as many passengers as there are people in all of North America and South America, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Poland, Spain and Germany combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1930, the total mileage run by American passenger trains at a mile a minute, or more, was only 1,100 miles a day, while today it exceeds 50,000 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first streamline train was placed in service in 1934, and today there are 88 high-speed light-weight streamline trains in operation, on </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">18 </span><span class="font10">railroads, in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fifty-six percent of the passenger trains classified as the fastest scheduled runs in the world operate on American railroads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A railroad passenger can now leave New York on Friday night and arrive on the Pacific Coast the following Monday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One dollar now pays for carrying a railroad passenger 54 miles, compared with 32 miles in 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pullman and Dining-Car Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the course of a year 174 million pieces of linen and 535,000 blankets pass through the Pullman Company’s laundries. Last year the Pullman Company, the world’s greatest housekeeper, purchased 220,528 sheets, 157,780 pillow cases, 20,253 tidies, 455,829 towels, 24,318 headrest covers, 13,692 napkins, and 3,260 tablecloths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reason, why the railroads know that Americans like pie is that apple pie is the most popular dessert served on railroad dining cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first railroad dining car was built in 1868, by George M. Pullman, and was named “Delmonieo”, after the famous New York restaurateur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railroad dining cars use, each year, about twenty-four million eggs, nine million pounds of potatoes, two million pounds of butter, one and a half million oranges, fifteen thousand barrels of apples, three and a half million quarts of milk and cream, a million loaves of . bread, and about thirty million rolls. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railroad dining ears serve twenty-five million meals a year—which is equivalent to serving every inhabitant of a city of nearly 23,000 population with three meals a day for an entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railroads buy and use more than 70,000 different commodities, including such things as pfns, needles, strawberries, locomotives, rails </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">bridges, and railroad purchases are made in 12,000 communities, located in all of -the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">States, and in 85 percent of the counties in the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Now Talking About Freight</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do you realize that the railroads last year performed a service equivalent to moving one ton of freight 2,230 miles for every man, woman and child in the United States?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railroads are the backbone of the nation’s transportation, because only railroads can provide the efficient, low-cost, all-weather mass transportation service required by industry and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Last year the railroads loaded 30 million cars of freight and hauled them distances ranging from a few miles to more than 3,000 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About 39,750 five-ton trucks would be required to carry the freight that one railroad hauls into, out of, and through Ashland, Kentucky, on an average day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To carry the freight moving on one line of railroad out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on an average day, would require 32,000 five-ton trucks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nearly 1,100 five-ton trucks would be required to carry as much coal as a hundred-car freight train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ninety percent of the nation’s freight traffic is handled in regularly scheduled freight trains that move on definite schedules, the same as passenger trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The average speed of freight trains last year was 61-percent faster than it was in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Approximately 80 percent of the operating revenues of the railroads is derived from freight traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The railroads now haul ail average ton of freight 98 miles for the price of one dollar, compared with 78 miles in 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Except for Japan, where labor is very cheap, American railroad freight rates, as measured by the average revenue received for hauling a ton of freight one mile, are the lowest in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To buy a three-cent postage stamp takes all -the income the railroads receive for hauling an average ton of freight three miles, because the average revenue is only about one cent a mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railway Express service in the United States was one hundred years old on March 4, 1938. The first “expressman” carried packages between New York and Boston in a carpetbag, and thus the service was inaugurated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In 1830 there were only 23 miles of railroad in the United States, while today the total length of all tracks operated in this country would form 138 lines reaching from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The United States has about 31 percent of the total railway mileage in the world—245,752 out of 789,000 miles of line—although the land area and population of the United States are less than 6 percent of the world’s total.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railroad tracks in this country are laid on more than one billion crossties—nearly 3,000 grossties being required for each mile of track.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Despite extensive tests over a long period of years, the railroads have failed to find a substitute, which will stand up successfully under heavy main line service, for the chemically treated wooden crosstie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The T-raii, and the “hook-headed” spike used today by railroads throughout the world to fasten steel rails to crossties, were designed about 1830 by an American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Railroads in this country began to place steel rail in general use about 1867. The average weight of steel rail in use in the United States is 94 pounds a yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The railroads, by using a welding process for building up the worn ends of steel rails, prolong the life of such rails fully one-third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The point of contact between the track and wheels of the modern railroad locomotive or car is no more than the width of a chalk line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first railroad tunnel in the United States was opened in 1833.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Class I railroads pass through 1,539 tunnels which, if placed end to end, would extend a distance of 320 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Supplies and Pag Rolls</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About two million tons of steel rail, enough to build a track ten thousand miles long, are normally purchased each year by the railroads of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The railroads use approximately ninety million tons of coal annually, or 22 percent of the nation’s total coal production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400320_files/g_E_19400320-4.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:43pt;">

<p><span class="font10">There is a railroad pay roll in every city and nearly every town and village in the United States, and railroad employees receive, in wages, around two billion dollars a year—or about half of every dollar the railroads take in. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The railroads provide employment to about one million wage earners, who, with their families, comprise a group of around four million men, women and children—which is more than the population of ten cities the size of Indianapolis, Indiana,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is estimated that for every man directly employed by the railroads, one man is employed by other industries in the production and distribution of the 70,000 different kinds of articles the railroads buy and use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■When their income will permit it, railroads spend about one billion dollars a year for materials, supplies and fuel, thus stimulating employment and local business throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Locomotives and Freight Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The building of a standard locomotive provides employment equivalent to the work of 50 men for one year, and requires more than 7,500. parts, from 119 manufacturing plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The firebox of one of the largest locomotives in operation is 9 feet wide and 22 feet long —or as large as the average room in a small home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The building of one freight car requires materials from 31 states and provides employment equal to the work of one man for a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Own the Bonds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I wonder whether you know that millions of persons benefit when railroad fixed charges are paid, because these charges are mostly interest on bonded debt—and 56 percent of the outstanding rail road bonds are held by life insurance companies, savings banks, educational and charitable institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The value of railroad property, after allowance for depreciation, according to the Interstate Commerce Commission, is about two billion dollars greater than the total amount of stocks and bonds in the hands of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reports filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission show that there are approximately 871,000 railroad stockholders. One large railroad is owned by 215,000 individual stockholders, and about one-half of them are women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Back in 1910, for every $1,000 invested in the railroad plant, the bonded debt was $606. This has been reduced until today it is only $439—or less than 44 cents for each dollar actually invested in the railroads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 20, 1940 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Barge and Truck Competition</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To provide and keep up </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font10">■roadways, and to pay taxes, railroads claim they pay out about </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">32| </span><span class="font10">cents out of every dollar they take ;<sub>n</sub> Cnly railroads, of all the agencies providing general transportation service, operate on their own roadways, fully pay their own costs, and contribute substantially, in taxes, to the support of. government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Federal Barge Line, Government-owned and -operated competitor of the railroads, pays no taxes, and its channels are built and maintained by the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The average annual cost of maintaining </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">mile of railroad, including structures, is $1,792, while the yearly maintenance cost of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font10">York Barge Canal is $4,749 a mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has cost the taxpayers of the country $145,000 a mile to improve the Mississippi river, exclusive of flood-control work. Users of this waterway enjoy a subsidy at the expense of the taxpayers of more than $10,000 a mile a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “taxes” paid by the highway carriers are not like railroad taxes. Railroad taxes are used for the general support of government. What the highway carriers pay is used, for the most part, to build and maintain the public highways they use as a place of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Federal Government has expended 61 billions of dollars to -encourage the development of transportation, of which 2| billions have been for -waterways and about 3| billions for highways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Passenger Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every once in a while you hear something about the railroads’ being on the downward path, but I wonder whether you know what kind of sendee they are now rendering to the traveling public. I live in Green River, Wyoming, through which pass many of the finest and fastest long-distance trains in the world. The other day I borrowed an American Railway Guide and made up my itinerary for my winter vacation, during this January, 1940, just past, as shown herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On this trip of less than two weeks I had an opportunity to see something of many of the most important cities in the United States; visited every state in the Union; saw all of the most majestic rivers; crossed some of the finest bridges ever made; visited the national capital, twelve state capitals and two Canadian capitals; saw some of the finest scenery</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font10">in the world; slept in a comfortable bed every night; had the best of meals; had access to all the best periodicals (except </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation),</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">with barber service, bath, valet service, ladies’ lounge, soda fountain, radio, daily market reports, and other features.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">». Jk Liberty'is liberty, even in Jersey V?'City, and so most real Americans will be pleased and interested in the paragraph in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">*§**! Post,</span><span class="font10"> which, commenting on the Supreme Court decision in the Jersey City cases, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From now on anyone may distribute circulars, conduct meetings or make speeches in Jersey City or anywhere else in the country without prior police permission, so long as he conducts himself in an orderly fashion, and the police are not entitled to decide, in advance, that a meeting should be barred because it is “likely” to be disorderly.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Relief Racket in West New York</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ West New York is a suburb of Jersey City and has been having a beautiful time working the relief racket. There is a little difficulty just at present, as 10 of the employees, Walter Brierty, Rinaldo Bozzuffi, Ellen Kelly and seven others in the office, and five outside of it, are being tried for forgery, larceny, and conspiracy in 289 indictments. Relief orders were issued to hundreds of persons who do not exist, persons who had left the city and other persons who had not asked for relief. It was all part of the racket to make America Fascist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Same as Anybody Else</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ A representative of Mayor Hague, welcoming a convention of the C. I. 0. to Jersey City, represented to the conventioners that Mayor Hague and the city government are just like anybody else. This should go in the “Appetizers” column, but there isn't room. M^yor Hague is just learning the ABC’s of what it means to be an American citizen. After all he has said and done to the C. I. 0. and kindred organizations it must bjirn him up to have to welcome them to his city, even by proxy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Blind Persons Have Right of Way</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Blind persons have been given the right of way in traffic in New Jersey. The blind of Jersey City have been presented with white and red canes which give them the right of way at traffic intersections. There are 3,000 blind men and women in the state that will benefit by the new law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Cleaning Out the Trust Company</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The Hague gang had a delightful time cleaning out the New Jersey Title and Trust Company, of Jersey City. When they knew it was going to capsize they patriotically withdrew over $2,000,000, so it would be sure to collapse. Then that highly honorable Hague judge, Thomas F. Meaney, resigned his $15,000 a year job so that he could collect the fees which would come in serving as counsel for the State Banking Commission in the eleaning-out process. Fine business, boys!</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>“Liberty Is Dead”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ At Plainfield, Samuel W. Rushmore placed a huge black wooden coffin on the roof of his mansion at 604 Belvidere avenue, placed on the front of the house a large painted sign reading, “Liberty is dead; Heil Hague,” and at the end of his porch put a large ashcan bearing another sign reading, “Hague is the law; dump law books here.” Mr. Rushmore is an old-fashioned American, of whom there are still a few, here and there.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Diaz of Jersey City</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ During the generation in which Porfirio Diaz was president of Mexico it was against the law for any voter to vote against him. That was a fine arrangement for Porfirio while it lasted. In Jersey City Frank Hague has been elected mayor six times, and in the last election he received 110,743 votes for and only 6,793 against. He is so popular that one man voted for him 137 times in the last election, and boasted of it. Porfirio Diaz died in exile.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Dorothy Stood by Celenwa</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Dorothy Johnson’s parents, living in Philadelphia, decided to spend last summer in Atlantic City, but the cat Celemma would not be allowed to go. That is what the parents thought. Dorothy thought otherwise. She lit out with the eat, hitchhiked to the seashore, slept under the boardwalk, and showed up with three cents unexpended capital still on hand. She was allowed to stay, and to keep her eat. Dorothy is 13.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Two Years for Ten Cents</span></h4>

<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Five Modest Trenton Cops</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">The modesty of Trenton cops is most touching. City ordinances of the New Jersey capital city forbid bingo. The city prosecutor denounced all operators of bingo games, and the police said they would take the operators to court on lottery charges. So far so good. Sergeant Kester Hughes (note. the good old name) and four brave men went to St. Michael’s Roman Catholic Church while a big bingo game was running full blast, but, you know, the “Reverend Father” Rakvica, who was running the lottery, would not let them in, because they had no tickets, and those five cops had been so well brought up by their mothers that they went right away without doing one more thing. Now, isn’t it nice to have such modest cops?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>That Was Just Too Bad</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ That was just too bad that those boys at Upsala College stole some; examination papers on religion and other subjects, copied them and sold them to fellow students for $5 apiece. One of the purchasers was a skillful buyer: he paid $2 down and the balance after satisfying himself that the copy was a true copy. Whoever swiped the original papers let himself in between 11: 00 p.m. and 1: 00 a.m. through a window which had been opened from the inside during the day. The boys made good use of their papers. One who had been getting very low standings in his class work received an examination standing of 97. The Prof, thought that was too much of a good thing, and an investigation followed which brought the foregoing facts to light. Four boys were expelled, and a fifth suspended.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Gave the Murderer But 50c</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ At Camden the “Reverend” Walter Dwo-recki, Baptist clergyman, paid a former boarder for murdering his own daughter, so that he could collect $15,600 insurance on her life. The sum agreed upon was $100, but the clergyman paid only 50c on the account. While his attractive daughter was being choked to death with the bare hands of the former boarder the “Reverend” was conducting “evangelistic” services to “keep people out of hell”. When he saw the body of his daughter he put on a big display of grief. The “Reverend” has been unlucky in several arson and counterfeit money enterprises in which he has been engaged, and was easily caught.'</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Do You Like Them Steam-cooked?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ How do you like your babies ? Steam-cooked </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">If so, apply to Perth Amboy General Hospital, where four were nicely done an hour after they had been inspected by the head nurse, Daisy Alaguinness, and found all right. That was at 1:30 a.m. The radiator valve in the nursery had been taped because it would not hold together otherwise. Just as soon as Coroner Flynn had announced that the accident was unavoidable, the tape was removed, and with it the evidence of criminal negligence. A fireman stated to a reporter that the nurses sometimes removed valves to put up the temperature. What kind of hospital is it that would have radiator valves that a nurse could remove without a wrench, or in which a quadruple roasting such as this could occur? What with cooking men at Holmesburg and now steaming babies at Perth Amboy, it appears that everything is coming along nicely for the party anticipated just prior to </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Arma</span><span class="font10">geddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Nincompoops at Trenton</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It would be a disgrace to the worthy peanut to refer to the state senate of New Jersey as composed of peanut politicians. Imagine the utter worthlessness of men, seven Democrats and seven Republicans, that would rush to appoint as a judge of the Court of Errors and Appeals a man that less than three years previous had been admitted to the bar. When the New Jersey State Bar Association sought to investigate the qualifications of Frank Hague, Jr., to this $9,000 job the nincompoops at Trenton hurried and put him in the office anyway. Hague is a national menace.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>It Pays to Advertise</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Robert Bierbaum, Camden grocer, was about to fail because his customers owed him $2,700 which they would not pay. He posted a sign in his window that he was about to close up shop because the following persons owed him the amounts stated. On the first day he took in over $500, and stayed in business.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Crooked Officials Jailed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ What is going to happen ? At Paterson three former officials of the local relief administration were put in jail for conspiracy to misappropriate $15,060 of the city’s relief funds. If New Jersey would jail all its crooked officials there would not be enough honest ones left to do the chores.</span></p><img src="g_E_19400320_files/g_E_19400320-7.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:75pt;">
<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Punishment of East Indian Racketeer</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Two of our Indian pioneers, Tony and Dan, in the course of their work in Poona of proclaiming the good news of the advent of the Theocratic Government, called at the home of an Indian religionist, Pastor Savant, and were invited by him to play the phonograph speeches. This was done, and he at once manifested the goat-like disposition that Jesus said would identify His enemies. (Matthew 25:31-46) Instead of showing the gratitude due to those who seek to do good, this man resorted to violence as his father did before him.-John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dan had been a newspaper correspondent for India’s leading newspaper until the truth reached him and he entered into its service, and, thinking this news item would interest the local press, he sent them a brief account of what had happened. But the Press of India is as prostitute as that in other parts of 'the world, and these rejected the item submitted, preferring the favor of the local religious crowd to keeping faith with their readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have not the ability to mass hundreds of publishers at a given town, as have you; but we have that same consuming love for Jehovah as have His people elsewhere, and we gladly responded when the Bombay branch office invited another pioneer and me to take the sound-ear to Poona. We are an insignificant body compared with the massed millions of India’s population, but we have no fear for the Devil’s hordes; our only fear being of Him whom we love supremely—Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We took with us a thousand handbills which read as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion versus Christianity</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIAN PASTOR ASSAULTS CHRISTIAN WORKERS -</span><span class="font10">Two of Jehovah’s witnesses,- working with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, are in Poona preaching the gospel of God’s Kingdom by means of recorded speeches and printed literature. While working in Rasta Peth on October lt&gt; they happened to go to Pastor Savant’s house (St. John Mission) and with his permission reproduced some Bible lectures by Judge Rutherford. As these lectures exposed the hypocrisy of the Christian reli-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">gionists and showed a difference between religion and Christianity, the pastor became enraged, with the result that one of these witnesses was assaulted and abused by him and, as though that was not enough, this said witness was obstructed by force from leaving the premises for some time and further assaulted. A complaint has been filed at the Quarter Gate Police Station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This sort of thing compares very well with the intolerance and religious persecution which Jesus and His disciples encountered. No doubt Pastor Savant was not afraid of these two witnesses who visited him, but he plainly was afraid of the truth which they brought to the attention of the people who listened to those lectures. Jesus warned His followers that they would be hated of all nations for His name’s sake, and especially by the same crowd of religionists who persecuted Him to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same speeches which were reproduced to the people of St. John’s Mission are available for you to hear quite free of charge. You are invited to ask for them to be reproduced in your own home, or anywhere else. If you cannot ask one of Jehovah’s witnesses personally, write for further information and literature to the Society’s office:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, </span><span class="font10">17 Bastion Road, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bombay</span><span class="font10"> 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These were distributed among all of the English-speaking public of Poona during the courseofour door-to-door work, and given out to those who listened to the lectures from the sound-car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At our very first pitch a man who invites those who can be so duped to call him by the title “Father” in direct violation of the commandment of Jesus to the contrary (Matthew 23: 9), a minister in the Church of England, went off for the police. But while “Father” was able to induce a posse of police to come and listen to the lectures, he could not induce them to break the law by arresting us for exercising our lawful rights. So “Father” helped us to the extent of increasing our audience to the amount of six constables, for which we thank him. They listened to the lectures and, we hope, enjoyed them. We gave them handbills, and the “father” went away, no doubt much disgruntled and dissatisfied with a world that no longer jumps to obey when a back-tojront collar and flowing maternity gown commands. I found my sei f thinking that the police of America might learn a lesson from their less civilized (?) brothers in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Notice was read out in all of the churches that Jehovah’s witnesses were in town, and that nobody should hear us, take our litera</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ture or entertain us—a bit of free advertising for which we were truly grateful. Even the clergy may sometimes do good, howsoever unwittingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We learned that Pastor Savant had a crowd of cronies to whom he dispensed occasional material blessings in the form of drink and food, and these were to attack us if we went anywhere near to his locality. Nothing deterred, and trusting in the protection of Jehovah, we went; and no harm came to us. “The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds; their might hath failed; they became as women.” (Jeremiah 51:30) Instead of the promised thrashing, we got a large and attentive audience, among whom, perhaps, would be the pastor who had dared to touch one of the Lord’s anointed, gnawing his tongue and kicking himself for a fool as the hypocrisy of the clergy was shown up by the lectures and his own particular wicked act told over the microphone. At most places 'where the lectures were given some people of good will were located.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now Poona has a Model Study class started, and many are showing an interest in Christianity as opposed to religion. Some of these are from Pastor Savant’s own flock, and I had the privilege to get in some “’locust” work at </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 20, 1»4O </span><span class="font10">a meeting arranged by them with the sole object of finding out why all of the clergy were warning them to have nothing to do with us. This was their very first Question; I took in a very long breath and answered. It was midnight when we at last went home to our food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The last that we heard of Pastor Savant was that he was consulting his lawyer for fear that we were going to take legal steps against him. He need have no sueh fear—we are not seeking our own vengeance; for Jehovah will settle all accounts at Armageddon. It is truly a strange work in which we are engaged, and with all my heart I thank Jehovah for the unspeakable privilege of being called to engage in it. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The work in India goes steadily forward. From various parts of our field I hear of advances being made. In fact, just now it seems that the toil of many a difficult year is beginning to bear fruit; for from various places I hear of opposition being aroused and of some coming into the fold of the Lord’s '‘other sheep” as a result. Only those who actually work in this country know of the difficulties that confront us at every turn; and only we know the great joy that comes from serving faithfully in spite of these difficulties, and our cup of joy flows over when we behold the</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Last Wednesday morning there was a company drive and I was working with them as </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">usually do. In the course of the morning I observed a lady leaving her house three or four doors from where I was and my first thought was to let her pass without witnessing to her, but second thoughts prompted me to approach her quickly and before she had got many steps from her front gate. Judge my pleasure when after hearing the nature and purpose of my work she said “Come in” and returned indoors. Presently she stated that she was a Catholic. It was a Catholic district and a few minutes earlier a lady had, with a demonstration of indignation, come out of her house after me and tore up and threw away a Catholic-Fascist Menace leaflet. However, the lady I was interviewing had a very different mind and listened attentively to what I had to say. She said that she had not been satisfied' for some time, and later divulged that at one time she had attempted to leave, but the “Father” ■ had created a great fuss and so she ultimately allowed him to persuade her to stay. I asked whether she was a “practicing” Catholic, whereupon she told me that she was unmarried, was a lady of independence living in her own house and owning property; that she arose at 6; 15 a.m. and went across to the “Church” and opened it</span></p><img src="g_E_19400320_files/g_E_19400320-9.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:127pt;">

So I offered to lend her ■my Catholic Bible. I returned with it the same evening (also some records). She welcomed me and said she was free and desired me to go in. So I played several selected records, and when Judge Rutherford said on the “Enemies” record that for 1500 years the Roman Catholic Church had worked much injury to the people she spontaneously responded “That’s true”.

<p><span class="font10">♦ We have had a very interesting experience in Kapuskasing. The chief of police accosted us three times demanding that we obtain a license to sell books, We showed him our testimony card and explained that we were placing literature on a contribution basis and did not need a license. He commanded us to secure a written order to this effect from the<sup>1 </sup>town clerk. We put him off the first time and studied our Order of Trial for our course of action. It occurred to us that it might be the decent thing to go to the town clerk, give him a witness and explain our work, but did not go, because we were afraid this would constitute a compromise. In this case the chief seemed to be trying to intimidate us into leaving town; so we continued working, and after interrupting us three times he picked us up and took us before the magistrate at the town hall. The chief accused us of selling without a license and said he had a witness ready to swear that we “sold him” a book; that there were complaints coming in every day about our ‘bothering the people and refusing to leave their homes without their buying our books’; and what was more, they wanted to hear this “offensive record” we were using in this work. We waited until the chief got done spluttering, and then presented our testimony card and explained that as our organization had a charter to work anywhere in Ontario we did not consider it necessary to ask permission to do this work in Kapuskasing. The magistrate asked us where we had worked before, and whether we had been asked to secure permission to work in the other towns. We said, No, no one had even suggested such a thing; most church organizations solicit contributions for</span></p><img src="g_E_19400320_files/g_E_19400320-12.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:132pt;">

<p><span class="font10">their work, so why discriminate ? He then called up the party the chief mentioned as his witness and asked him if lie remembered getting a book from one of Jehovah’s witnesses and did he buy this book or did he contribute to the work. Just imagine our relief when the man assured the magistrate that it was a donation. At this point the chief again mentioned the record; so we asked permission to play it. Both men listened attentively right through “Snare and Backet” and at the conclusion the magistrate assured me it was a “very interesting talk”. Naturally this was a little hard on our Catholic friend, the cop, and to let him down a little the magistrate gave us quite a talk on the importance of the town officials’ knowing what was going on in the town. He ended up with the admonition to hurry up and get finished and get out of town because the telephone was kept busy with complaints about us. He stood up then, rubbing his hands as if to be through with us, and said, “Well, Chief, I won’t do any more about this,” and walked out. We asked the chief if everything was O.K., and he said “Absolutely”. Needless to say there was a couple of thankful pioneers that moved out of that town hall quickly.— Mrs. E. Holland, Pioneer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">♦ To be sure, it is not to one’s personal credit that he serves the great Creator' with all his powers. Who does less is very foolish, unworthy of life, and is sure to die. However, the account of faithful service of those who do serve under great handicap thrills the heart of all who are interested in the vindication of the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the leper colony of Pirapitingui, Sao Paulo, Brazil, is an active company of Jehovah’s witnesses. With testimony card, literature and phonograph they visit again and again the other patients of the colony, to the number of 2,500 to 3,000; visit the hospitals, where they play the records and read to the blind patients; and conduct Bible studies with the books and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> every night in the week. Not content to witness only to those in their colony, they applied to the State Leprosy Board for permission for those who were physically able to visit another colony at Santo Angelo. After some months the request was granted, and five of them spent three happy days witnessing in Santo-Angelo, finding interest and placing considerable literature. One interested person whom they found there was</span></p><img src="g_E_19400320_files/g_E_19400320-13.png" alt="" style="width:108pt;height:34pt;">

How the Lord is finding the Jonadabs and a.dding them to His flock, even in a leper colony, is shown in the following story' told by one of Jehovah’s witnesses in Pirapitingui;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“A little old woman, widow of one of Jehovah’s witnesses who had died about six months previous, was dying in the isolation hospital of the leper colony. She was almost illiterate, but had continued to receive, read and pass on the best she could the sweet message of life contained in the publications of the Watcii-towkr Society. ’Please don’t use any candles for me. I don’t need them. Jehovah is my light,’ she said. Her request was honored; she was buried without candles (contrary to the usual custom), and the young man who heard her request asked for her Bible and literature, read them, and has now taken his position on Jehovah’s side, where there is light.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Easter the Demon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">(CVT </span><span class="font10">OW about that time, Herod the king</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">1.\| </span><span class="font10">stretched forth his hands, to vex certain of the church. And lie killed James the brother of John with the sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers, to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.” (Acts 12:1-4) If “Easter” were a Christian feast, then King Herod the Jewish proselyte would not have shown respect for it. On this text the Catholic Douay Version Bible reads: “And when he [Herod] had apprehended him, he cast him into prison, delivering him to four files of soldiers to be kept, intending, after the Pasch [(Am. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font10"> Passover], to bring him forth to the people.” In the face of all this the religionists of “Christendom” celebrate Easter, which is anti-Christian, demonist ic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Note </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font10"> Volume 5, which says: “Easter.—The English term, according to the Venerable Bede . . . relates to Eostre, a Teutonic goddess of the rising light of day and spring, which deity, however, is otherwise unknown, even in the Edda . . . ; Anglo-Saxon, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">easter, . . </span><span class="font10">. Easter is the principal feast of the ecclesiastical year. Leo I . . . calls it the greatest feast </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(festum festorum), </span><span class="font10">and says that Christmas is celebrated only in preparation for Easter. It is the centre of the greater part of the ecclesiastical year. . . . the Apostolic Fathers do not mention it ... ” Thus it is shown that Easter honors a woman or a demon rather than Christ Jesus, the Son of God, whose resurrection religion claims to celebrate oh Easter Sunday, the day of painted Easter eggs and bunnies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mark how religion has from the very beginning pushed the resurrection of Christ Jesus to the side. It was God’s purpose that Jesus should be both the ransomer and the deliv-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ever</span><span class="font10"> of believing men; and' He could not be the deliverer if He remained dead. It was therefore necessary for Jesus to be resurrected. The question may be asked: If Jesus was put to death as a man, and the value of His sacrifice as a man must be presented in heaven to God, “whom no man hath seen, nor can see,” how could a man appear in heaven and present that ransom price? The answer is: He could not, for the reason that no man has access to the spiritual realm. (1 Timothy^ 6:16; </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font10">Corinthians 15:50) </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font10">human creature is confined to earth. Jesus died as a man, but His Father Jehovah God raised Him out of death a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">spirit</span><span class="font10"> creature. About this </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font10">Peter 3:18, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font10"> plainly says: “Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being' put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Resurrection of the dead means an awakening out of death and a standing up again to perfect life. The man Jesus was dead and must forever remain dead as a man, to the end that His right to live as a human creature might furnish the redemptive price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The resurrection of Jesus was up to that time the greatest demonstration of God’s power ever made manifest to man. Jesus’ resurrection was and is a part of God’s great arrangement for man’s deliverance. This being true, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">it is </span><span class="font10">to be expected that Satan the enemy would do all within his power to prevent the resurrection of Jesus, and failing in that he would do everything possible to blind the people to the truth thereof. It is reasonable to conclude that Satan knew the words of the prophecies. Jesus’ resurrection was anticipated. For the first day after Jesus’ death the Devil and his invisible angels, demons, and probably some of his visible angels, would be celebrating. They would be felicitating one another over the death of Jesus. At the first sober moment, they would recall His words concerning His resurrection. The record is: “Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say Unto the people, He is risen from the dead; so the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said unto them; Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can: So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch?’—Matthew 27: 62-66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan the enemy knew of Jesus’ words to the disciples, and Satan put that thought into the minds of the chief priests and Pharisees. Satan would reason that he would prevent the resurrection of Jesus, if possible, and, failing in this, he would so confuse the minds of the people that they would not believe that Jesus had been raised from the dead. Satan failed in the first, but he has fairly well succeeded in confusing the truth of the resurrection of Jesus. God has given such abundant proof, however, as to the fact of the resurrection of Jesus that all may know, and all will know when their minds are opened to a proper understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Having received this suggestion from Satan, and having been authorized by Pilate the governor to provide a guard, the clergy hired a guard and put them at the tomb to watch. This guard kept close watch; but in due time there came to the tomb the angel of Jehovah God and rolled back the stone from the door and opened the sepulcher to reveal that it was empty. The guards, greatly frightened by what they saw and heard, hurried to the city to tell the religious clergy that Jesus had been resurrected from the dead,—Matthew 28:1-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At once the unholy triumvirate of commercial, political and religious elements called a council, in which they expressed all the wisdom they had, trying to solve their difficulty. After much deliberation the financial part of the trio raised a large sum of money and passed it into the hands of the clergy, and they in turn bribed the guardsmen to lie by instructing them: “Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day..”—Matthew 28:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So well did they work this scheme that for over nineteen centuries a major portion of the peoples of earth have not believed in the resurrection of Jesus. The Devil was able to create such a doubt that many have not known whether the Lord Jesus was resurrected or His disciples carried away the body. But, notwithstanding this effort of the enemy, Jehovah saw to it that an abundance of proof was provided, sufficient to satisfy any searcher for truth then or thereafter that He had raised up His beloved Son out of death. The Devil’s later effort was to confuse Jesus’ resurrection with the demon Easter, “a goddess of the Saxons, or, rather, of the East, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Esters,</span><span class="font10"> in honor of whom sacrifices [were] annually offered about the Passover time of the year (spring).” (McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia)</span><span class="font10"> “The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.” — 1 Corinthians 10:20, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When God raised Jesus out of death, the great Master did not appear to the religious clergy that they might see Him and be witnesses. Had Jesus done so they would not have told the truth about it. It is to be observed that the Lord never uses wicked ones for His official witnesses. Religionists may talk in His name, but they do so without authority. The Lord chose as witnesses to the resurrection those who had been faithful and those who loved Him, and who resisted the demons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">that farm for sale?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Certainly the owner does not need it,” answered the father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Dad,” asked the child further, “to whom does he want to sell it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“To a man who would need it, my child.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The child went into a meditation. A few minutes later they approached to a colony of falling-down barracks, which stood so close to each other that it was hard to pass through them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Here it is so tight,” said the child, “why do not these people move over to that large farm ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That farm does not belong to them, and it is going to be sold,” replied the father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Then why do they not buy it?’ inquired the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' “Because they have no money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“But why haven’t they got it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Father kept silent for a while. “Don’t ask so much!” said the weary father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The child remained silent for a long time. Coming back home by a different way, they approached a palace, before which was hung a large sign board, “To Rent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The child looked (at it, but said nothing. A few steps from the sign, against the wall, slept a very old woman dressed in ■ ragged clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Why does this woman sleep on the street, and not at home?” now asked the child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“She has no home!” answered the father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Then why does she not go to this large house on the opposite side, as it is vacant?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“This house is not hers,” said the astonished father, “nor is she allowed to enter a stranger’s house!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Why not ?” asked the child, with obstinacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Who would not allow her ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The law! And who made the law?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again the father kept silent for a while. “You will wear me out with your questions,” said he.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They went farther. At the crossing of two streets stood a crowd of people looking at a horse lying there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Get up,” cried the coachman; “get up, Jack!” But the horse merely lifted his head just a little. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Get up!” cried, the people; “get up!” But he did not move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the people began to think as to what to do to remove him from the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Dad,” said the child, “if all these people would take hold of the horse and help to remove him, the road would be clear; isn’t it true?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">It should not be overlooked that Pope Clement XIV, who suppressed the order, was himself educated by the Jesuits. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font10"> explains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whether from principle or policy he proceeded with great circumspection in the suppression of the Jesuits, the decree to this effect not being framed until November 1772, and not signed until July in the following year. This memorable measure, which takes rank in history as the most, remarkable, perhaps the only really substantial, concession ever made by a Pope to the spirit of his age, has covered Clement’s memory with obloquy in his own communion. There can not he any reasonable doubt of the integrity of his conduct, and the only question is whether he acted from a conviction of the pernicious character of the Society of Jesus, or merely from a sense of expediency. In either case his action was abundantly justified, and to allege that though beneficial to the world it was detrimental to the church, is merely to insist that the interests of the Papacy are not the interests of mankind. IIis work was hardly accomplished ere Clement, whose natural constitution was exceedingly vigorous, fell into a languishing sickness, generally and plausibly attributed to poison, [Regular policy of the gang,—</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pictures Tell the Story</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The book is beautifully gotten up. Its appearance would be a credit to any publisher, and with the orange and dark-blue lines at the top and bottom of each page, and the numerous pictures scattered through it, and the maps, the normal child would be bound to be interested and delighted. That makes the book all the more dangerous to lovers of liberty and truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are pictures and maps on 120 of the 406 pages that go to make up the book; and as pictures leave a more lasting impression than words, on the child mind and on the mind of adults too, they may be considered somewhat as to their objective. That objective is to convince the child that “Our Developing Civilization” [the subtitle of the book] is developing along the lines of religion, and that the more religion is put into it, the better; and that the best of all religions is the Roman Catholic religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The maps are not so badly infected. The pope’s triple crown and keys appear on one; Charlemagne praying in front of a huge cross, just before he goes out to murder those that will not submit to being baptized, is on another; a third one is a muezzin lifting his blood-stained hands' to Allah; but there are nine other good maps that could not be criticized. Proportion of religious maps, 25 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are 19 full-page illustrations or pages of pictures. One of these is of the Rheims cathedral; another show's a churchman, a high ecclesiastic, standing back of King John and compelling him to sign the Magna Charta; a third is a monk acting as physician to an ailing child; a fourth is a reproduction of the work of a monk, showing the virgin Mary introducing the child Jesus to the doctors of the law' in the temple (despite the fact that she did not know where he was at the time); a priest is shown on the very first page of illustrations in the book; Jesus blessing children is shown on one page; another shows a muezzin calling Mohammedans to prayer; in another page scene a priest is standing by to bless a vassal when he kneels before his lord; one full page is devoted to a beautiful imaginary illustration of a monastery; there is a full-page picture of Joan of Are, sainted because she was demonized—heard spirit voices. That makes ten out of the 19 fullpage pictures either with a religious motif or with religious features. That is 52.6 percent of tire most important pictures in the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Will that have the effect of impressing religion on the child mind as being the most important thing in life? It is intended to accomplish that very thing, and is not at all badly planned to do so,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Misleading</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the Children</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Says the retiring invisible empire to its successor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">To mislead a child by causing it to reverence superstition and error and the teachings of men instead of the Word of the true and living God is to do one of the most reprehensible things a human creature can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are 90 less-than-full-page illustrations in the book, most of them excellent and instructive; some of them not so. There is a large-sized picture of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, in bed, reading the lives of the saints; a picture of a Jesuit priest in China; a picture of the pope putting the crown on the head of Charlemagne; a picture of the pope crowning another king; a priest teaching school; a monk, with a cross conspicuously delineated; a monk inviting travelers into a monastery; a monk feeding the birds, to show his interest in all living creatures; a priest ringing a mission bell; Charlemagne approving plans for a great cathedral; a picture of Christ before Pilate; one of Constantine accepting Christianity; one of King Clovis and his wife, each holding a big crucifix; one of Mohammed thinking about religion; one of Mohammedans fighting for religion; one of a squire kneeling in prayer in a stained-glass - window church; one of a churchman reading the first summons to parliament; one of Joan of Arc tending her father's sheep;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">one of Henry the Fourth waiting out in the cold in the snow for three days to get an audience with the pope; one of Peter the Hermit organizing a “crusade” — the forcing of the religion of the cross on the heathen ; one of the crusaders en route to the Holy Land; one of the crusade of the children, being led to their doom by religion ; a picture of the madonna; a picture of Luther nailing up his theses on the door of the Wittenburg church; a picture of the pilgrims going to church ; and something that came mighty near being overlooked altogether -—a very delicate sidestepping of the whole</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Inquisition horror. That makes 26 religious pictures out of 90, and comes to 28.9 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, then, out of a total of 120 pictures and maps there arc 39 that have religion mixed up with them; that is 32.5 percent of the total, and it would be fair to assume that the motive in the preparation of the book was at least 32.5 percent religious, away from God, toward men, and not in the interest of the children temporally or etern'ally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Now About the Reading Matter</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reading matter is at least as religious as the pictures. There are 14 pages about “The Beginning of a New Religion”, supposedly Christianity. Midway is a picture of one of the early popes or priests, standing in front of a huge cross; he is preaching in the Cata-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">combs; he has a cross on his vestments. The next to last paragraph states that Peter was “the first bishop of the church at Rome’*, which is Untrue, and the last paragraph is about the pope and devoted to the theme that “in time the term ‘Pope’ came to inean the Boman bishop only”. Clever work on the part of the writers and against the children; is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are 20 pages about monks and monasteries. These contain 34 pages about “Saint” Benedict, who thus occupies in the book a little more than the space given to Jesus of Nazareth. This will help the child assess the relative value of the two. The concluding picture in this section says, “The monks helped their fellow men in many ways, and they were kind to all living creatures.” Bully monks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are 21 pages about the Crusades. In the moralizing which starts this section off Almighty God is charged with the raids of the barbarians who pillaged “Christian&quot; countries, All the Crusaders had to have a cross on forehead or breast. The crimes committed by the Crusaders constitute one of the worst records of all time. The book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Middle Ages </span><span class="font10">merely vaguely hints at this. One form of praise is the condemnation of an evil thing with a faint condemnation, smiling while you do it. It takes an artist to do that, but it is done right along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are 22 pages about Tiie Reformation, and when the student has finished this chapter, winding up, as it does, with 44 pages of fulsome praise of the Roman Catholic “Church” and particularly the Jesuits, the natural result in his mind is that he thinks that on the whole this period is one of real glory to the church, and that while a few individuals at times did a little something off-color, yet the institution as a whole was and is A-l.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">About the Inquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oh yes! About the Inquisition. Did you ever hear of that worst of blots on the record of humanity, wherein some 50,000,000 human &quot;&nbsp;X&gt;jL creatures suffered at the hands of the worst fiends the earth ever knew? You are in luck. You got your education before </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Middle Ages</span><span class="font10"> was published. It is not even mentioned in the six-page index of this oh-so-valuable work on history for children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But don’t think the child is to be left without any impression on this subject. He is left with an impression, but it is a false one. On page 199 is a picture of a man walking blindfolded over a floor covered with red-hot plowshares. Under the picture it says, “If he burned himself on the hot plowshares, he was declared guilty.” A bishop and five priests witness the performance, but the scene is sandwiched into a chapter on “Trial by Jury”. There is nothing said about the Inquisition; but the child sees the picture and the context and gathers the impression that it had something to do with trial by jury, and does not have any conception of the fierceness, the devilishness, the beastliness, the inhumanity back of the whole infernal thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In one of the nonreligious chapters, on pages 244-251 inclusive, the writer seemed to fear he had not said enough about the pope; so he got down to business and mentioned that gentleman 37 times in the eight pages. He went to bat for him 11 times on one page.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Slop from Hollywood</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The Associated Press carried as news a dispatch from Hollywood that “Bryan Foy, who used to be one of the Seven Little Foys, is looking for movie stories which have Catholic priests in featured roles”. The interesting thing about this propaganda is not that the priests are heroed in everything that comes out of Hollywood nowadays, to the disgust of millions of Americans who have no use for their racket, but that The Associated Press would carry such a patent advertisement of the Hierarchy as “news”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Cates Wants to Know</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Referring to Roosevelt’s appointment of his own personal ambassador to the pope the “Reverend” J. Elmer Cates, of Calvary Methodist church, the Bronx, wants to know whom Myron C. Taylor represents and whom the president represents; Of course, nobody should be sarcastic, but Mr. Cates leans that way when he says, according to the New Y'ork </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And who is the president representing? Presumably the American people, part of whom are 100,000,000 Protestants and 5,000,000 Jews. Has there been any demand on the part of this overwhelming majority of our people to have the pope represent them ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Taylor Wants More Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Religion, the guidance of mankind by human tradition and human great ones instead of by the Word of God and its truly great Author, makes a great hit with the humans who take themselves seriously. Thus Myron C. Taylor, the pro-Fascist ambassador of Roosevelt to the pope, after his appointment, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I am doubly pleased that the opportunity comes through the field of religion, that great cornerstone on which civilization and man’s dearest hopes for the future have and must rest if human destiny is to aehievq its ultimate triumph over the forces of evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">We Put It Over—Didn’t We?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Eugene Paeelli, at present holding down the job of pope of Rome, feels that hd and Franklin D. put it over on ■ the American people in pretty good shape in the appointment of Myron C. Taylor, of the Steel Trust, as Roosevelt’s private ambassador to the Vatican. In his letter to Roosevelt (which it took him only fifteen days to write, after he knew all about the appointment) he follows his usual custom of smearing ink on paper with hundreds of words where six words would do as well. It isn’t convenient to tell Eugene too much about how to ran his business, but if he wants to get to first base in these days he can’t spend too much time chatting with the umpire after he has swatted the ball. The best thing he can do is to gather up his skirts and. beat it for the bag like Paavo Nurmi or Jesse Owens when they are in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His papers (published in London) admit that it took years for Mundelein and others to crowd Roosevelt into doing this, and he came to it only when he realized he must. It comes with rather bad grace, then, for Eugene himself to say that America’s “Chief Magistrate of the great North American federation, under the spell of the holy night of Christmas should have taken such a prominent</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Uemery {London)</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Britain Snowbound</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• Two weeks after a series of unusually heavy .snowstorms, and with (for Britain) very low temperatures, the people were allowed to know what had happened. The snow and the eold were general, but beyond that mails were very late, and the long-distance trains'were either not running or were a very long time in their trips; there was no general knowledge of the hardships to which the midlands and the northern parts were put. Food and coal supplies got to very low proportions in many places, and the country generally has had a hard time. It is now said that Britain has had the most severe weather and the lowest temperatures for well-nigh 100 years. In this land, with its short distances between towns, and its excellent transport facilities, there is no provision made for these visitations which occur once or twice in a century; so, apart from the personal troubles, the great manufacturing concerns have been held up or greatly hindered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Britain’s experience has been common to all the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere, though surely shorter than that of many other lands. Except in Finland, where Russia has shown its haste to occupy the country, the cold weather has held up the war activities on land. In France and Germany, where the armies of the Allies and the Germans face each other, the battle has not yet been joined. These armies seem about as stuck as were the armies of Israel and the Philistines in the war which God settled through young David. Whether this unusual eold in these northern latitudes is just a. happening or is one of the forces which the Creator is using to affect the issues, wo may not know. We may know, however, that the events in the earth and the quarrels among the nations at this time are inside the purpose of God; for the day of His judgments is come. Men and nations may make their moves, but the end comes on. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses telling the peoples of the earth'of the purpose of God to bring the nations before Him, according to the prophecies He caused to be written -for this very time, is now known throughout the earth. The war, whether on Britain’s part in the declaration of seeking freedom for the peoples from the. aggression which has brought such death-dealing destruction on the continent of Europe, or on Germany’s part in resisting the Allies, is hastening that gathering of the peoples to face the facts of His judgments. In the meantime, while the great armies are in a condition of stalemate, the war in the air and under the sea, and the difficulties of seaborne transport, are hitting the nations in their vitals.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Evacuation of Children</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• The pin seems to have come out of the Government’s scheme for the evacuation of children from the cities and towns which are considered most liable to bombing. To the Birmingham education committee figures were reported which show the breakdown of the scheme in that city. Of the number of children taken out to areas, considered safe, only about 9,000 have remained; which, says the report, means that 93 percent of elementary school children are in the city and are without the necessary teachers. This condition in Birmingham is by no means unique; rather it is typical. As the Government has not moved to bring the teachers back, not yet submitting to the parental forces against them, the majority of the teachers are yet in the country small towns and villages. In one instance a report showed that there were 16 teachers for 43 children. It was a great scheme for the protection of the young, but it has come unstuck, probably in great measure because the feared bombs have not come.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>“Impartial Justice”</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• High over the dome of the Central Criminal Courts in London is a figure of a woman, blindfold, holding the scales of justice in equal balance. Impartial justice is represented, telling that in the courts below the persons brought to trial, perhaps with the death penalty a consequence of an adverse sentence, no other consideration than that of a true judgment without fear or favor to accuser or accused will be given. No doubt it is true that in the British courts, whether ih the criminal or in civil actions, there is always the intention to proceed to and give a true judgment. In the civil cases, where case law so frequently determines a judgment, there is often a question of its rightness; but the reputation of the judges </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">hopesty is not brought into question. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font10">applies to the criminal courts and its judgments. There is now no possibility of a rectirrenee of the “bloody assizes” of Judge Jeffreys marked by the judge’s relentless cruelty and his manifested eagerness to pass the death sentence on those accused of participating in the Monmouth rebellion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">But it is not every person who, having the responsibility of conducting a judicial inquiry, is guided by the example of the higher courts. The smaller the man, the more likely he will want to expand himself. In the tribunal to try the eases of the conscientious objectors in the Newcastle district, the chairman of the court, the judge (Richardson) whose observations about the young men known as Jehovah’s witnesses called forth the rebuking remarks from the bishop of Birmingham, has continued to manifest his unbelief in their sincerity, and has, as one; thinks, shown his partiality towards his own prejudices. Differing from every other court the Newcastle court has not allowed one of Jehovah’s witnesses to remain on the register of conscientious objectors to war and to work for the advance of the war. The judge of the Newcastle court had an objection to the statement in the “testimony” card which all </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font10">ehovall’s witnesses use in their work of preaching the gospel from house to house. The card says the bearer is an ordained minister of Jehovah God, to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ, and is an accredited agent of the Society in whose work he has a part. The clergy </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">all the religious sections claim the right of ordination to the ministry of the gospel of the Kingdom, and this is the word which designates entrance into the closest form of ‘trades unionism’ on the face of the earth. The word is, of course, Scriptural and is properly used by the Society in its commission to have the Gospel preached in all the world. No human authority may reserve to itself the right to limit the freedom to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom, nor is there any truth what</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">ever </span><span class="font10">in the claim of the churches to give file status of “minister” to any person, nor is there any value in their laying on of hands designating a person is ordained. But this close corporation is necessary to the system of the human government in the churches, and is strongly supported by men such as this chairman of the Newcastle tribunal, spoken of in the Scriptures as the principal of the flock of the false shepherds.—Jeremiah 25:34, 35.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>A “Red” Dean</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• The Church of England is like the Papal church in its priestly characteristics, but its form of government (episcopalian) prevents it from becoming a totalitarian organization as Rome is. Its bistiops are as princes in their diocese and cannot easily be deposed from their little kingdom even though they say and do things which are quite out of agreement with the prayer hook (which is as a Bible authority in the church), or even express disagreement with the 39 Articles which state the beliefs and the practices of the church. The bishop rules the churches in his diocese, and the parsons in that diocese&quot; may not exchange service with those of another except by the consent of the bishops. The bishop is a prince in his kingdom. Much the same kind of rule is enjoyed by the deans of the various cathedrals. The cathedral is placed under the control of the dean, and clergy other than those who are appointed to conduct its services may not be allowed there to serve except by the consent of the dean; and this applies to bishops and to the two archbishops also.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">The “red dean” is the dean of Canterbury. He is very “red”, not only in that he is a believer in communism as a theory, for he is an ardent admirer of the Soviet and its government, and even of Stalin. The dean will share the platform at Communists’ meetings, advocating that form of government. Since Soviet Russia has made the attack on Finland, shocking the world by this cruel aggression with its death-dealing terrors, the dean has published a book extolling the Soviet. He contrasts the conditions of England wdth those of free Russia to the advantage of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">na</span><span class="font10">tionals of Russia, and of Stalin he says, “Stalin </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">no oriental despot. His new Constitution shows it. IT is readiness to relinquish power shows it. His refusal to add to the power he already possesses shows it.” No doubt the dean had written his laudation before the outrage on Finland began; but he has caused it to be published since then. The dean must make the dignitaries of the church of England see red ; but he holds on to his job, at £2,000 a year, and there is no power to put him out of it because of his political beliefs or acts. The archbishop of Canterbury probably feels a bit red when he has to arrange with the “red” dean about the services, and in that the eathe-dral which gives them both their title shelters so radically minded a dignitary of the church. No doubt the pope and his cabinet take a little pleasure out of this rather awkward situation of the archbishop, a situation which would be impossible under Papacy's totalitarian rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Blind and Dull of Hearing</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• One of the “very reverend” of the English Roman Catholic fathers, preaching in their cathedral in Westminster, said, “The whole </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">Christianity stands or falls by the [religionists’] claim that Christ is part of the trinity.” He concluded his remarks by quoting the last words of the twentieth chapter of the gospel of John: “These things are written that ye might believe that. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that, believing, ye might have life through his name.” This “very reverend father” also told his audience that Jesus was crucified because He said He was God. In saying that he lines up with the Pharisees and the leaders of religion who caused Jesus to be killed. Jesus spoke of himself as the son of God, and, in dispute with the Jew's, said, “Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the w’orld, Thou blasphemest; because I said, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">am the Son of God,” and He told them what He meant by saying He and His Father were one. He was doing the works of His Father, as they had to admit, “that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.” (See John 10: 29-30.) That Jesus had and has a unique relationship with God, the Creator, and because of His fidelity to His Father’s commission is made Lord of all, has a place at the FathePs right hand, is the revelation of God concerning Him, and further disclosed both by His own words to His diseiplcs when with them, and afterwards by the instruction they received from Him through the holy spirit, Words could not be plainer in their intent than those given in the Scriptures. The Jews were ready to kill Jesus because He said He was the son of God, and today the leaders of religion arc ready'to destroy the witnesses of Jehovah, faithful disciples of Jesus, because they say openly that the dogma of the trinity, which makes Jesus God the son, is wholly contrary to the Scriptures and must be accounted as a blasphemy against the name of the Living God, the Father of Jesus. The fact is that the dogmas of the churches were moulded into shape to build up a religious system; have been promulgated for that purpose; have been and are retained to maintain these organizations. They were never intended as helps to the understanding of the Scriptures and of the purposes of God therein revealed. The perversions of the sacred writings by the Jews prevented them from receiving the truth when Jesus came, and brought about the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the nation. History in this is being repeated: the same conditions are present, but on a worldwide scale, and the same results are in sight.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>More Foolishness -</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">• In that same center of Roman Catholicism, the Westminster cathedral, the same reverend, who is Superior of the Roman Catholic missionary society, likened the Nazi and Soviet aggression on Poland to a serpent, and added, “No armies could crush the serpent, Only the mother of God could.” The pope claims to be the vicegerent of Christ, and ought to be able to crush any serpent. The “father” seems to have talked somewhat at random, for he went on to say, “We Catholics have such immense power, if vve could only use it. Power with God. We are God’s own people, and in a sense, we make God act. . . . And if you and I have power with God, what about Our Lady, the mother of God—whose heel is upon the serpent’s head?” To stamp on this serpent “belongs to the mother of God. And she will, if we ask with the faith that removes mountains”. The reverend went on to put some words in the mouth of Jesus, as if spoken by Him when He was crucified, making Jesus say to His followers concerning Mary His mother, “Pray to her, and yon pray to me. Honor her and you honor me.” This priest spoke what the Roman Catholic church teaches in this dishonoring of Christ; but the worship of Mary has been a great asset to that God-dishonoring system. To those who are enlightened by the Word of God, and who know the truth concerning God and Christ, and are servants in the great Theocratic kingdom, these things seem almost too foolish to mention. But this Roman system is making a bid for the conversion of Britain; is the most active of all the ehurch systems to its interests, and this makes it worth while to mention it's foolishness, its darknesses, its perversity, and to recall the fact that it is the leader in religion, and has been and is the Devil’s chief agent in deceiving the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Parents Were at the Movies</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The custom of some selfish parents in going to the movies or dances and leaving their children at home received a sad rebuke in the great fire at Lagunillas, the shantytown built on stilts over Lake Maracaibo. The parents could not help it that two big pipe lines broke and flooded that portion of the lake with oil, or that the oil took fire, or that their homes, 200 of them, were burned, but they could be sorry for the little ones that did not even have a chance of life. First accounts were that as many as 800 perished, but this was subsequently reduced to about 100, which seems more reasonable, but bad enough even then.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">♦ The dictator of Bolivia had a German grandfather, and his brother-in-law, Kbviehi Seito, is a Japanese subject.

Imports increased from $15,000,000 to $35,000,000. The country is as large as the great states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska, is only ■partially explored, and is known to have riches of minerals, oils, rare woods and agriculture almost limitless in extent. Peru has only begun to grow', and in the Kingdom it will be a happy land for millions.</span></p>
