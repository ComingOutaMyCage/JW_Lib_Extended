<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent In the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with ail power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and Is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, which has now begun ; that the Lord’s next great act Is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The annual vacation period of the members of the Bethel family at Brooklyn this year is from Saturday, July 20, to Sunday, August 4, inclusive. This will allow them a diversion from their regular activities at headquarters, and especially to avail themselves of the privileges of the 1940 Theocratic Convention of Jehovah's witnesses and of the increasing opportunities for field witnessing The normal operations of the factory and office will be suspended for that period; no books will be shipped or regular mail answered. Hence all field publishers should order sufficiently in advance that their supplies of literature to carry them through the vacation period and to the end of August may be shipped out not later than the evening of Friday, July 19. Also reserve your correspondence with the factory and office until after Monday, August 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC CONVENTION OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The manifest leadings of the Lord indicate that all lovers of the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God should assemble in general convention in 1940.

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INSTRUCTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye </span><span class="font3">tn </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the Lord for ever; for in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.&quot;—Isa. 26:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font5">EIIOVAH continues to instruct his people, that they may be very courageous, strong in him and in the power of his might. In this hour of great distress, when the demons by the use of religion are debauching the human race and the woes upon the world are increasing, the faithful servants of Almighty God, both the “remnant” and the people of good will, must continue to seek meekness and to receive instruction from Jehovah. Those who now know of The Theocracy and the blessings it will bring to the people, and who obey the great Theo-crat, must hold fast to what they have and continue to increase their knowledge and to confidently rely upon their great Teacher, the Lord. Wickedness shall not continue for long now. Jehovah God is in his holy temple. His judgments by Christ Jesus proceed. Within a short time Jehovah will bring the religious, totalitarian oppressors down from their high places and put them where they belong. “For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he lay-eth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.&quot;—Isa. 26:5,6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> In this issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah turns his attention again to rebellious, unfaithful and bloody “Christendom”. He emphasizes the fact that upon the skirts of the religionists of so-called “Christendom” is found the blood of many innocents. Those innocents whose blood has been shed embrace the “remnant” and their “companions”, a number of whom have recently been killed to satisfy the malicious spirit of religionists. Jehovah by his Word and his witnesses in times past has raised his voice against “Christendom” and repeatedly warned her, but the leaders of “Christendom” continue to disobey his commandments. She turns a deaf ear to Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and puts her trust in demons. She not only holds herself aloof from The Theocracy, but opposes it and prevents others from fleeing to that great “city of refuge” which God has provided for those who sigh and cry for the abominations seen in the religious organizations. “Christendom’s” religious, political, commercial, judicial and military elements are loud-mouthed, rapacious and greedy, seeking the honor and praise of men, and putting on a form of godliness, posing before the people as followers of Christ but denying Jehovah God and his King. She chooses to obey and teach the traditions of the world rather than give consideration to God’s Word. She obeys the demons and rebels against the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> The prophecy then shows that Jehovah continues to send his witnesses throughout “Christendom&quot;, commanding them to declare his judgments against the unfaithful who have professed to serve God and Christ. “Christendom” shows no shame for her unholy conduct, but walks on in darkness and in rebellious action in defiance of the Most High. In the Bible and in secular history Jehovah has given “Christendom” many examples of retributive justice executed against those who defy his name and challenge his supremacy. This, however, is not heeded by “Christendom”, and particularly by her leaders. “Christendom” refuses to consider the witness work which the Lord is causing to be carried on in the earth. His work is a “strange work” to them because it exposes the hypocritical to the view of all hone-t men. “Christendom” goes from bad to worse, and finally God commands all creation to take heed to the fact that he will wait only a little longer and then he will perform his “strange act”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WOE TO THE REBELS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Resuming the detailed consideration of the prophecy at this point, note that Jehovah says to “Christendom”, and specifically to her leaders: “Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!” (Zeph. 3:1) The announced woe of Jehovah here is upon Satan’s organization, and particularly the religious element thereof operating in the earth, and Jehovah’s time draws near when just punishment upon the wicked shall be executed. Note, then, that in this part of the prophecy Jehovah turns away</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">from modern Nineveh, that is, the political element that defies his Theocratic Government, and specifically directs his attention to religious “Christendom”, which was pictured by unfaithful Jerusalem. As Jerusalem fell away to religion and defied Almighty God, even so “Christendom” at this time has followed the same course. Today “Christendom” practices what the leaders call the “Christian religion”, professing to be in covenant relation with God and that the leaders in “Christendom” are his servants. In fact “Christendom” is made up of a rebellious crowd that do the will of the Devil and other demons. Jehovah calls “Christendom” ‘that filthy city [that rebellious city (R.P.)]’. Ancient Jerusalem rebelled against Jehovah while at the same time claiming to be the servants of the Most High. Jerusalem made a record against herself, and concerning this God caused his prophet to record: “Nevertheless they [the professed servants of God; Jerusalem] were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets, which testified against them to turn them to thee; and they wrought great provocations.”—Neh. 9:26.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Jerusalem was more reprehensible than others because she claimed to serve God, whereas her leaders, particularly, were extremely hypocritical. They were the sons of the Devil, as the Lord’s Word shows: “And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that ha.th rebelled against me; they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.” (Ezek. 2: 3) “Thus saith the Lord God, This is Jerusalem : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her. And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.” (Ezek. 5:5,6) “But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.” (Jer. 5: 23) “Make ye mention to the nations: behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. As keepers of a field are they against her round about; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 4:16,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">‘ The woes that come upon mankind from Satan are due to malicious hatred. The woes that come upon rebellious ones from Jehovah God are for just punishment. To rebellious Jerusalem Jesus said: “0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.”—Matt. 23:37,38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup> The antitype of Jerusalem, present-day “Christendom”, rebels against God, because she openly claims to be in a covenant with God, yet persists in breaking all his commandments and turning wholly to demonism. She sides in with God’s avowed enemy and works constantly against The Theocracy and against the faithful people of the great Theocrat. “Christendom” now works hand in hand with the heathen nations which openly defy Jehovah, the Almighty God. “Christendom” is therefore a covenantbreaker and worthy of death.—Rom. 1: 31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within the borders of “Christendom” there have been two classes of persons: one, the ruling, religious element; and, second, those of good will toward God who have been held in subjection and in prison by the ruling element, that is to say, the clergy and the “principal of the flock”. Present-day “Christendom” includes within her borders both the rebellious class and those who shall form the “great multitude”. The religious ones are still in the dark and walk on in darkness; while those of good will are seeking the light, that they may find the way of escape. Jehovah compares the two classes in these words: “Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High; . . . Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.” —Ps. 107:10,11,13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God thus shows that those of kind heart and of good will toward him he delivers out of trouble. Such persons of good will escape and flee to The Theocratic Government and thus find a place of safety, while the rebellious ones remain in darkness and upon such a just retribution shall be visited.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The ultrareligionists are, as the prophecy says, “polluted.” It was so with unfaithful Jerusalem; so it is now with unfaithful “Christendom”, who practices the “Christian religion”. Concerning these rebellious ones the Lord says: “They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.”—Lam. 4:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> That description exactly fits the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen who advocate wars, such as that carried on by Franco and by Hitler and others, men who,- bent upon satisfying their own ambition, have no regard for the rights or the lives of other creatures. All these unholy, uncalled-for wars have been fully supported by the “Hierarchy of Authority”. After Franco had finished his ruthless and bloody slaughter in Spain he was commissioned by the Hierarchy to offer sacrifices in the temple, as though he were a priest appointed by God for that purpose. Thus he reproached God’s holy name after having been guilty of the greatest crimes against men. The Hierarchy entered into concordats with Hitler and Mussolini, who likewise in recent years have indulged in an uncalled-for slaughter of human creatures. And now, when there is another cruel and unrighteous war on in Europe, many of the clergy, even in the United States, urge that the United States government must enter that war. On January 21, 1940, the American Press Association published throughout the land the following: “Protestant clergymen, at their meeting in New York city, issued a statement declaring that Christians cannot remain neutral in the present international conflict; that the American churches are under obligation to lead their nation in assuming a responsible relationship to these wars.” Thus they show that they are in darkness and continue in rebellion against The Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Those persons of good will toward God take note of Jehovah’s denunciation of the religious leaders, whose garments are besmeared with human blood unrighteously shed. To such Jehovah says: “In thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents ; I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” (Jer. 2:34) “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. None call-eth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth; they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.”—Isa. 59:2-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> In the face of such plain statements of warning from the Almighty God religious leaders harangue the people about religion, the purpose being to induce the fearful to flee into their religious organizations, which are the traps of Satan. These big religionists induce the political and commercial allies to cry out to the people: “We need more religion, else our nation will perish.” Thus the religionists continue their rebellious and hypocritical course against Jehovah. Those religionists continue to claim that they offer sacrifice unto God: “Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is contemptible.”—Mal. 1: 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPRESSORS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Further describing the rebellious and filthy &quot;Christendom”, Jehovah says: “To the oppressing city.” Thus God foretold that the organization of &quot;Christendom” would oppress all who would not come under her control. “Christendom” has long oppressed the servants of Jehovah. Today they reproach and oppress Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in a way more cruel than at any time past. These faithful servants of Almighty God “Christendom” persecutes and oppresses without excuse or cause. Throughout all the earth the religious leaders oppress Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions and attempt to deprive them of all lawful rights and privileges and to hinder them from carrying the kingdom message to those who desire to hear. They even denounce them before the other governing factors, denying the individual rights of men to worship Almighty God as he has commanded. All this they do in defiance of God’s law. When a “stranger”, that is to say, a person of good will pictured by Jonadab, seeks the truth the clergy vex him, and this they do in violation of God’s law: Leviticus 25:14, 17; Leviticus 19: 34.—Ezek. 22: 2, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Unfaithful, religious “Christendom” continues to interfere with the strangers to The Theocracy and to try to prevent them from hearing the truth. When public halls are taken by Jehovah’s witnesses and it is advertised that the people might come and hear the gospel message, particularly concerning The Theocratic Government, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies demand that the use of the hall shall be denied and that the meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses be broken up and that these faithful witnesses of the Lord be driven out. All possible influence is brought to bear by such religionists to prevent the people of good will from hearing by radio the message of The Theocratic Government. The freedom of the press and freedom of worship are denied to the faithful servants of God, and in this the Hierarchy call to their aid and into action the political and commercial elements of the governments. In the totalitarian parts of “Christendom” laws are enacted and enforced making it a crime to assemble and study the Word of God. The police are employed to arrest, assault and imprison those who bear testimony to the name of the Most High. All the facts, therefore, show that the religionists, that is to say, unfaithful “Christendom”, are both filthy and an oppressive organization. Jehovah takes notice of all such and declares that in his own due time and good way he will act.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Further speaking of that rebellious organization “Christendom”, Jehovah says: “She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the Lord; she drew not near to her God.” (Zeph. 3:2) Repeatedly Jehovah has spoken to “Christendom” by his prophets and repeatedly brought to the attention of the religious leaders their rebellious acts against God and his kingdom. The religionists have had the Bible in their possession and have even had to do with distributing it throughout the earth, and yet they refuse to hear and to obey the instruction that comes to them from the Almighty God. Because she has refused to receive instruction and correction, and because she has refused to trust in Jehovah, but has turned away to demons, Jehovah says to her: “Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.”—Ezek. 22: 21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Jehovah has been long-suffering with “Christendom”, and now there is no excuse that she can offer for her rebellious spirit toward the Most High and for her persecution of the servants of the Almighty God. The messages which Jehovah sent to unfaithful Jerusalem now apply with stronger force to “Christendom”, for the reason that “Christendom” is the antitype of unfaithful Jerusalem and has had to do with the experiences of Jerusalem, and the repeated warnings set forth in the Bible: “But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.” (Jer. 7 : 23, 24) “Therefore now amend your ways, and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.” (Jer. 26:13) This latter scripture is a further warning from Jehovah calling upon “Christendom” to repent in order that she might escape destruction. There is no doubt that these prophecies were spoken primarily to Jerusalem, and there cannot possibly be a doubt that they apply more fully to “Christendom”, because it is plainly written: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples [types </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)] ;</span><span class="font5"> and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.”—1 Cor. 10: 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> As Jeremiah spoke primarily to Jerusalem the message of Jehovah God, so now the antitypical Jeremiah, Jehovah’s witnesses, at the command of the Most High, brings Jehovah’s message to “Christendom” and calls her attention thereto and that of all who have a hearing ear. God tells all such that they must hear and obey, otherwise they cannot receive his protection and blessing. Repeatedly these commandments of the Lord have been called to the attention of “Christendom”, and particularly that of her religious leaders, but the message of warning is refused. The religionists disdain God’s servants and denounce them as meddlers in religious affairs. “Christendom” imagines herself to be a law unto herself, with no one having any right to criticize her or call attention to her rebellious course of action. Jehovah’s witnesses carry the message of God to “Christendom”, and not their own message. Therefore the opposition on the part of “Christendom” is against The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRECTION REFUSED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Self-centered, arrogant and scornful, the religious leaders refuse all instruction offered to her by the Lord, and therefore he says of her: “She received not correction [that is to say, instruction].” When Jehovah’s servants take his message throughout “Christendom” the leaders say, in substance: “We are clergymen; no one can teach us. Away with you! We have the Bible; we do as we like.” At all times these men have had the Bible. They have no excuse for being ignorant of what the Scriptures contain. They have claimed to teach and to discipline the heathen nations, but they refuse to correct their own course of action. They could have received the knowledge of the truth and faithfully imparted it to others, and this they have not done. Concerning their course of action Jehovah says: “He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct * he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?” (Ps. 94: 10) As Jehovah warned unfaithful Jerusalem, so he now continues to warn “Christendom”: &quot;Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.” (Ps. 2:10-12) “Be thou instructed, 0 Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.” (Jer. 6: 8) Instead of appreciating such instruction from the Lord religionists, particularly “Christendom”, refuse to hear. The leaders in “Christendom” see only the frail servant -of God, who have brought to them God’s message, and vent their spleen upon these creatures rather than give heed to the words of the Lord set forth in the Bible. Jehovah foreknew this, and he caused his prophets to forewarn “Christendom”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Have the religious leaders trusted the Lord God <sup>? </sup>He answers: “She trusted not in the Lord.” For thm reason “Christendom” has no claim for protection during Armageddon and shall receive none. Only those who seek righteousness and meekness, trusting fully in Jehovah and his King, have any promise of being hid at Armageddon. To those faithful ones, pictured by Jonadab and Jonathan, Jehovah says: “I will surely deliver thee [from the Executioner], and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee; because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 39:18) “Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.” (Jer. 35:19) These words of the Most High apply at the present time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> “Christendom” trusts wholly in human influence brought forth by the Devil for the purpose of deceiving: such inventions as peace pacts, protective associations, armies and navies, Papal concordats, traditional lies, the power of money, the assurance- of dictators, the words of the pope or others of the Hierarchy; and then continues to howl before the people and harangue them, saying, “Give us more religion.” All of these things are the result of the influence and power of the demons upon those who practice religion. These opponents of The Theocracy make idols and trust in them, because the demons have induced them to defy the Almighty God and disobey his commandments. Therefore God says to them: “What profiteth the graven image, that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?” (Hab. 2:18) “He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.” (Prov. 11:28) “He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; but whoso walk-eth wisely, he shall be delivered.” (Prov. 28: 26) The leaders in “Christendom” have not drawn near unto Jehovah God. Now the great Theocratic Government holds no interest for them whatsoever. They defy the Almighty's righteous government and continue to oppose it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ROARING </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">lions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> The high-ups in religion, politics and commerce are designated as princes because such rule. These princes or mighty ones put the people in fear to keep them in subjection, and of such princes Jehovah says: “Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.” (Zeph. 3:3) Such princes brag and roar, hoping thereby to frighten the people into submission and obedience to their edicts. The pope and others of the Hierarchy roar over the radio to impress their importance upon the people of the world. Hitler, Goebbels, Mussolini, Roosevelt and others likewise roar out their words, hoping thereby to cow the people into subjection. They require the radio stations and public press to repeat their roarings, and thus they frighten their prey by their big noise. Jehovah knew their number from the beginning and he recorded it for the benefit of those who now trust in him. Such roaring ones are after their prey: “The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.” (Ps. 104: 21) These newly elevated lions thus described by the Lord have no regard </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for </span><span class="font5">the people’s rights but to use the people for their own selfish purposes. They open their mouths and howl and roar like mad lions and bulls: “They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.” (Ps. 22:13) Today the roaring of the religious and political lions continues with ever-increasing noise. Their roaring frightens everybody except Jehovah’s witnesses and their faithful companions, who serve God and who therefore fear no creature. These mighty roaring princes claim to be the higher-ups and higher powers, but they are not.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Concerning the judges Jehovah says they are “evening [night] wolves”; “they leave nothing till the morrow.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version) </span><span class="font5">“Christendom's” political, religious judges are anxious to please those mighty men of their organization, and therefore they lend their ears to the big religious princes. Such is particularly true in many places in New Jersey. Those judges send Jehovah’s witnesses to prison merely because they bring to the attention of the people the message of God for the consolation of the people that they might have hope. When the witnesses of Jehovah are haled into court some big influential Roman Catholic exercises his influence, and the decision against Jehovah’s witness is a foregone conclusion. When the higher-up princes in the Hierarchy libel or slander anyone who speaks the truth concerning that rebellious organization, the courts announce that they have a right to thus indulge in slander and libel for the protection of then-flocks. God will not overlook such judicial conclusions. The Lord God likens them unto wolves that leave nothing over until the next day but clean up right now and remove all the bones that might obstruct and hinder the march of the religious princes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Throughout the prophecies Jehovah recounts the many wrongful deeds of his typical people; and such record applies with greater force now to “Christendom”, because she is unfaithful and more reprehensible than her prototype. The prophets that served unfaithful Israel were not all sent of God. Many of those prophets (preachers) in Israel claimed to he the servants of God and to speak for him but were false prophets. (Deut. 13:1-5) Such false prophets are today serving in “Christendom”, particularly those who are of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. They try to induce the people to believe that they represent God, but they do not. Of them Jehovah God says: “Her prophets are light [leaping ones] and treacherous persons; her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.”— Zeph. 3:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> They leap into prominence for selfish show and gain. They are proud and vain-glorious in their attempt to appear before the political and commercial element as very important and very necessary. They seek the chief seats at political gatherings and feasts and on any and all occasions. They are clothed with unusual garments to impress the people as being very great and very good.-Matt. 23:1-11; 2 Tim. 3: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> The modern-day &quot;prophets”, particularly the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are, as stated, “treacherous persons”; that is, deceitful, lying and misleading the people. They put on a pious face and then secretly confer with the political and commercial element to do violence to others who are pursuing a righteous course. What God said of the false prophets of Israel and Jerusalem exactly fits the conditions that now exist amongst the Roman Catholic Hierarchy clergy, who claim to serve God and yet who resort to all manner of treacherous lies for selfish purposes. (Isa. 28:15) “Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me.”—Jer. 3: 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> As they deal treacherously with God’s servants, so they deal treacherously with him: “For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the Lord. They have belied the Lord, and said, It is not he, neither shall evil come upon us, neither shall we see sword nor famine; and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them; thus shall it be done unto them.” —Jer. 5: 11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Those clergymen have turned entirely away from Almighty God and Christ Jesus and have turned wholly to demonism or religion. Claiming to represent God, they treacherously act by claiming to preach God’s Word to the people while going contrary to that Word themselves. They put forward the doctrines of men, which originated with the demons. They deal treacherously with the Lord and with his witnesses, hiding behind the strong-arm squad and their ignorant dupes to carry out their wishes. They torment the people who serve God, by committing all manner of treacherous acts. They cause the arrest of Jehovah’s witnesses and induce political judges to inflict punishment upon them. Outwardly those treacherous prophets (preachers) profess to be servants of God, but they are in fact committing spiritual fornication with other elements of Satan’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Furthermore, says Jehovah of the false teachers of “Christendom” who claim to represent him: “Her priests have polluted the sanctuary.” Antitypically, this declaration of the Lord includes all the antitypical Levites, the clergy of “Christendom” and the “evil servant” class, once begotten of the spirit, who have become unfaithful and who oppose The Theocratic Government. They were once in line for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">place in the royal priesthood, but all of them together, that is to say, the clergy and the “evil servant”, constitute the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” —2 Thess. 2: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> “Christendom’s” priests have polluted what they falsely call God’s sanctuary, and the others of the “man of sin” pollute God’s real sanctuary. Therefore God says of such: “Moreover, this they have done unto me; they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they [with bloodstained hands] came the same day [straight from idol-worship and the spiritual slaying of those who would serve the Lord] into my sanctuary [there claiming to serve Jehovah God] to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.” —Ezek. 23: 38, 39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Otherwise stated, they have tried to mix devilworship or religion with what constitutes the worship of Almighty God, using the name of God in vain and using it to deceive the people and draw them into their religious trap and thus cause their destruction. Applying these words of the prophets to the “evil servant”: they have turned against God’s organization, and attempt to turn other consecrated ones away and thus bring about their destruction, and then come straightway from their bloody acts into God’s real sanctuary, that is, amongst his truly devoted people, and there falsely claim to represent him. This they do because they are under the power and influence of demons and, like the demons, are in darkness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>82</sup> These polluters of the sanctuary also abuse and maltreat those who are in fact a part of God’s sanctuary. The clergy of the Hierarchy, in particular, swear allegiance to the totalitarian monstrosity and work with such to gain control of the earth, and compel the worshiping and “heiling” of men, and the saluting of flags, thus attributing salvation to men and earthly things controlled by the state. Thus they put the state above Almighty God, while at the same time they claim and pretend themselves to be servants of Almighty God. They have brought military men and professional politicians into their religious organizations, and they have made of them the principal ones of their flocks and induce them to support the religious practices in order to satisfy their own personal and selfish ambition. These priests have sanctified wars of conquest and brought about the shedding of blood of millions of innocents. Add to such unrighteous conduct the gambling rackets that are operated in their religious edifices, such as card playing, lotteries, bingo games, charging money for the seats or pews in their so-called “churches”, and then extracting money from their parishioners beholding before them the hideous and false doctrine of “purgatory”. Thus they have fulfilled the words announced by the prophet in Zephaniah 3:4 above stated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> Those political, religious priests have violated God’s law knowingly and willfully. “They have done violence to the law,” says the prophet, and have thus defamed the name of the Most High. Concerning them God speaks by another prophet these words: “Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things; they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.”—Ezek. 22: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> To those false prophets and priests Jesus says: 'Why do you transgress the commandments of God by your traditions? Thus have ye made the commandments of God of none effect by your traditions [religious doctrines and practices],’-Matt. 15:3,6,9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> God then announces what is the correct duty of one serving in the office of priest: “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.” (Mal. 2:7) Contrary to that commandment of Jehovah, the priests of religion teach the people to violate God’s law and so do by bestowing honor upon men and by putting the state above Almighty God and by compelling the children to “heil” men and salute flags in order to instill into the young the theories and practices of the demons. Thus these priests pollute the sanctuary of the Lord and do violence to his law and reproach his holy name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> Concerning “this gospel of the kingdom”, which the Lord commands must now be preached to all the nations as a witness (Matt. 24:14), the priests not only ignore but do everything within their power to hinder obedience to such commandment. They destroy the hope of men concerning God’s provision for salvation. They deliberately fight against God and against his law. No wonder God announces his purpose to completely destroy religion and all who persist in using religion to defame his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> The time is now here for the judgment of “Christendom” to be executed, and therefore it is written in the prophecy: “The just Lord is in the midst thereof; he will not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.”—Zeph. 3: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Jehovah has installed Christ Jesus, the great Judge, upon his throne, and he now judges the nations. Therefore the Lord, being at the temple as the representative of the Most High, is in the midst of “Christendom”, not dwelling there, but as causing the present judgment of her. “God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. Defend the poor and fatherless; do justice to the afflicted and needy.”— Ps. 82:1-3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” This puts God near and affords “Christendom” an opportunity to hear and to know the truth. God and Christ Jesus are just and righteous and do no iniquity. According to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font5"> of this text, “Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous.” He will do no iniquity, because God is upright. “He is my Rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.” (Ps. 92:15) Exactly opposite to the righteous Lord, “Christendom” is designated as “the oppressing city”, or organization that oppresses and does evil to mankind (Zeph. 3:1); and concerning “Christendom” (that is to say, the religious organization that claims to be God’s servants in Zion) the prophet says: “They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.” (Mie. 3:10,11) That is to say, they build up what they call “Zion”, God’s organization, with wrongdoing and shedding of blood. While performing all the wicked deeds as set forth in the above scripture, these men of “Christendom” claim to lean upon the Lord and say: “Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us.” These men are so imbued with their selfrighteousness and their greatness that they brazenly say: 'Nothing evil shall come upon us.’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> It is clearly to be seen from these prophetic expressions that “Christendom” has no excuse for her unrighteous course of action, and this is particularly true with reference to the clergy. They claim to be supported by the Scriptures. They have the Bible, but they do not follow it. In this hour when God is causing the nations to be judged by Christ Jesus, the great Judge, he says: “Every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not.” By his witnesses Jehovah gives full notice of his judgment against “Christendom”, thousands of witnesses with phonographs proclaiming the message of God to the people; millions of books setting forth the Word of God are placed in the hands of the people of “Christendom”. This message of the Lord, brought to the people, is light. Therefore God does not permit “Christendom” to have any excuse for remaining in darkness. The responsibility is upon “Christendom”, and upon her clergy in particular. The Lord calls upon them and warns them to awaken out of her stupid condition and to walk circumspectly, not as fools, but they refuse to do so. (Eph. 5:13-15) “Christendom” continues in her course of wickedness; and, says the prophet above quoted, “the unjust knoweth no shame.” The clergy and the principal of their flock have no shame before the Lord, but in the face of all his warnings they continue to practice religion, the worship of demons, and to do the will of their father, the prince of demons. God’s work of warning progresses, that is, “his strange work,” exposing the shameful deeds of “Christendom”. Instead of “Christendom” and her leaders’ giving heed to God’s Word, the clergy try to justify themselves before men and to prevent the exposure of their own wrong-doing. This they do by using every means within their power to prevent the proclamation of God’s message of truth. If these clergymen had any confidence that their course of action is right they would not be disturbed by the proclamation that Jehovah’s witnesses bring to the people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTS OF WARNING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Jehovah was long-suffering with Jerusalem. He has been long-suffering with “Christendom”. He gave Jerusalem warning by his acts toward her and others, that she might have no excuse to continue in wrong-doing. Likewise God gives “Christendom” ■warning, and that repeatedly. “I have cut off the nations; their towers are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.”—Zeph. 3:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> As to Jerusalem, God had given warning in his act of cutting off the ten tribes or northern kingdom of Israel, which he did by means of using the Assyrian king Shalmaneser, whom he used as his executioner: “And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. And at the end of three years they took it, even in the sixth year of Hezekiah (that is, the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel) Samaria was taken. And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes; because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.”—2 Ki. 18: 9-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, mentioned other nations as being cut off. (2 Ki. 18:33-33; Isa. 37:11,12) Therefore God says: “Their towers are desolate”; that is, their strongholds are desolated: no one there to warn or watch over the people. The towns are deserted, none in the streets, just left as a “ghost town”: everything reduced to ruin, and a terror to behold, all testifying to the power and thoroughness of the executioner’s work in cleaning up the unfaithful. The people that were not killed fled away or were deported into foreign lands, and none were left to rebuild. That was a warning to Jerusalem, and should be even a greater warning to “Christendom”, the antitype of Jerusalem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> Then came, in the year 70 (A.D.), a complete razing of Jerusalem by the Roman organization. Just as Jesus had foretold and warned the religious element, the “holy city” fell into complete desolation. Now, since the Bible plainly states that all these things came to pass upon Jerusalem as a type or ensample as to what shall come upon “Christendom” (1 Cor 10:11), such should serve as a clear and definite warning to “Christendom” today. “Christendom's&quot; leaders in particular, who claim to know the Bible, should give full heed thereto. “Christendom&quot; has been thoroughly instructed and warned, both by the uttered prophetic Word of God and by his acts performed upon the prototype of “Christendom”. Does “Christendom” hear and give heed to these warnings! Does she see any instruction for her in these Biblical and historical truths published time and again? Do those acts of God speak to her more emphatically than God’s written Word?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> In the face of such true examples as set forth in the Scriptures and of the true warnings given in God’s Word which apply to “Christendom”, she walks on in defiance of Almighty God. Upon the leaders is darkness, and the people following these leaders are in gross darkness. Now Jehovah speaks again to unfaithful “Christendom” and says: &quot;1 said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off, howsoever I punished them; but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.”—Zeph. 3: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup> For centuries now the leaders in &quot;Christendom&quot; have held themselves out to the people as representatives of God and as the preachers of his Word. The clergy have had the Bible, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, chief amongst religion, have deliberately kept the Bible away from the common people. The Protestant clergy also have had the Bible, but they have given little heed to the warning therein, and now the so-called “Protestant” clergy have ceased their protest against the unholy and wicked action-of the Roman Hierarchy and have joined up fully with the Hierarchy in the attempt to rule the world in defiance of Almighty God. Have such religious leaders given any heed to the repeated warnings of Almighty God? Have those professed teachers of the Scriptures really sought any instruction from the Lord? The indisputable facts show they have not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>47</sup> In the year 1918 God sent Christ Jesus his King to his temple. There Christ immediately began the examination of and testing of those who professed to be consecrated to God and in a covenant with him to do his will. The result of that judgment was and is that many consecrated ones who claimed to be devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom declined instruction and have formed themselves into the &quot;evil servant” class. Not only have such refused to hear and give heed to the instruction from God's Word, but they have, on the contrary, opposed the proclamation of the kingdom message and vilified, abused and reproached the faithful servants of God who have proclaimed his message. Those who are there judged, and who are sent forth to serve the Lord, and who have been diligent to hear instruction from the Lord and to obey his commandments, have been blessed by the Lord and have been sent forth to continuously proclaim the great Theocratic Government. In 1918 Jehovah shortened the trouble upon the earth in order that his witnesses might proclaim his name, and he sent them throughout the earth to do that work. Since 1922 there has been no letup of the work of the witnesses to the name of Jehovah. That period of time has been the chance of “Christendom” to hear instruction from the Almighty God to deport herself accordingly.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> Jehovah then revealed to his faithful servants their “new name”, since when they have been properly known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”. (Isa. 62:1-3; 43: 10-12) In obedience to the Lord’s commandment these witnesses have been diligent and constant in carrying the message of God to the people of “Christendom”. Instead of hearing such message of information and warning from Jehovah and facing about and serving him, religious leaders of “Christendom” have continued to act in defiance of Almighty God and have persecuted and continue to persecute his faithful messengers. This they do because under the influence and power of the demons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>49</sup> In the year 1922 Jehovah began to pour out the &quot;seven last plagues” upon “Christendom”, but instead of “Christendom” taking warning therefrom the leaders of “Christendom” became angry and violent towards Jehovah’s witnesses and raised a great roar and howl, saying that the message of Almighty God “shocks our religious susceptibilities”. This they did because they were under the influence and power of the demons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> These ultrareligionists then attempted and have since carried on the persecution of those who obey Cod's commandments and who have brought to the attention of the people that Satan's organization is near at an end. To be sure, Satan would induce his servants to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses because they announce the rapid approach of Armageddon. The time came for Jehovah to reveal to his people their “new name” and at the same time to tell of God’s final judgment upon “Christendom”. God then contrasts those unfaithful ones with his faithful servants. To the unfaithful and defiant religious crowd Jehovah says: “But ye are they that forsake the Lord, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number. Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.&quot;—Isa. 65:11,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>51</sup> Then in contrast to the wicked ones Jehovah addressed the faithful: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name.” (Isa. 65:13-15) This prophecy the Lord has clearly fulfilled, and he has constantly fed his faithful servants upon the rich spiritual food from his table, and their joy has increased. The very opposite has been the state and condition of the rebellious filthy “Christendom”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>52</sup> Jehovah in his goodness has repeatedly warned “Christendom”. And why? He answers: &quot;So their [(/i.F.) her] dwelling should not be cut off.” Had “Christendom” given heed to God’s instruction and obeyed his voice she would not be cut off On the contrary, she has defied Almighty God; therefore Jehovah says: “Howsoever I had punished her.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> (R.V.)  </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span><span class="font5">) Jehovah inaugurated and since has carried forward his “strange work”; that is, he has sent forth his witnesses to tell the truth of and concerning his kingdom and the punishment that shall come upon all who oppose it. The proclaiming of that truth oi God’s Word has certainly been a punishment and torment on “Christendom”, particularly of her leaders. They have gnawed their tongues and howled. Instead of heeding warning which God has given, the religious leaders of “Christendom” not only have protested violently but have resorted to all niannei of violence to prevent the proclamation of the Theocratic Government. No repentance on the part of “Christendom” has been indicated. Instead of face about and giving heed to Jehovah's Word, the i eli gionists have given themselves wholly over to resistance of the Almighty God, refused his warning and instruction, and continue to indulge in the persecution of God’s faithful servants.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>53</sup> Of and concerning the course of action of “Christendom”, the religious leaders and the principal ones of their flocks, Jehovah says: “But they rose eail&gt;, and corrupted all their doings”; that is to say, they have indulged in corrupt practices from early morning on throughout the day and night. They further corrupt themselves by joining with cruel political rulers who have no respect for God or man but are wholly devoted to the Devil and who oppress and regiment the people and take away all their liberty They further corrupt the people by using eveiy means at hand to prevent them from hearing instruction from God’s Word. They have been diligent day and night in such wicked course.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>54</sup> Right after the World War had ended these religionists got an early start by declaring that the League of Nations would furnish the means for the salvation and peaceful dwelling of the people on earth. They formed a confederacy to rule the world by man in defiance of Almighty God’s expressed purposes to rule it by Christ Jesus. Because they so did, God, foreknowing this, gave warning, saying through his prophet: “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us.”—Isa. 8: 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>55</sup> In further defiance of God and his King the same religious, political combine began to rage and to induce their followers to imagine a vain thing. They foamed at the mouth against God’s servants and boastingly declared that the state is above God and to be preferred and obeyed rather than the Most High. Concerning these it is written: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” (Ps. 2:2,3) Then the Lord Jehovah gave them further warning, saying: “Be wise now, therefore, 0 ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.”—Ps. 2:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>56</sup> The same conspirators became more open in their defiance of Almighty God and set about to destroy his faithful witnesses in the earth who continue to carry the message to the people. This the Lord foretold; as it is written: “They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”—Ps. 83: 3-5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Also at once the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the principal visible offspring of Satan’s organization operating in the earth, began to go about the land ‘singing her song like a harlot’ (Isa. 23: 15) and to play politics for the purpose of gaining control of the nations of the earth. That religious institution has since then continuously drawn attention to herself, thereby hoping to induce the people to believe that she has the backing of the nations that are “fighting Bolshevism or Communism”. This she has done for the very purpose of deceiving the people and inducing them to fight against all who do not agree with her. The ambition of that religious system is to ride on the top of the world and control the political and commercial part of it. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy joins forces with Fascism and Nazism and engages in a campaign to oppose the proclamation of the name of Jehovah and The Theocratic Government, and thus she goes on in her wicked course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The time arrives when the long-suffering of Jehovah toward his enemies comes to an end. That time is just the hour preceding Armageddon when God begins to maneuver his forces and the forces of the enemy for the final execution of His judgment written against the wicked. God sends forth his messengers through the land, and especially throughout “Christendom”, and causes them to sound his final warning to “Christendom” that Armageddon is near. Instead of receiving such instructions from Almighty God, and giving heed to such warning, big religious leaders say in defiance of the Most High: “We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.”—Isa. 28:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>68</sup> To such defiant and boastful words of the religious crowd Jehovah says: “And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isa. 28:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>60</sup> Now it is clearly seen that the religious leaders are marching on hand in hand with the political and commercial elements of the earth proclaiming that this combine alone can rule the world and make it a safe place for mankind. These religious leaders boldly announce that they are entirely safe from any harm and that the only means of salvation of the people is to do the bidding of the religionists and their allies. “Christendom” rushes on in darkness like the swollen waters of the Jordan rushing down to the Salt Sea. With great noise and with boldness, and in defiance of Almighty God, “Christendom” continues in her wicked course. The head of the Hierarchy and other religionists, together with the political and commercial great men, as the prophet sets forth, will soon say: “We are at peace, and we are in safety.” What will the Lord say to that boastful proclamation? What does Jehovah now say?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">HE early prototype of this true priest was a king named Melchizedek, being at one and the same time high priest of the Most High God and also king of the ancient city of Salem. Among the titles applied by Catholic prelates to the pope of Vatican City are such as “Melchisedec in Order”, “Abraham by Patriarchate,” and “Sovereign Priest”. He now faces Armageddon. The original Melchizedek was a prophetic character according to the declaration of the Most High God himself at Psalm 110:4,5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span><span class="font3"> “Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent : Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.” Whom did the priest Melchizedek foreshadow V</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The High Priest of Jehovah God is the one who serves him officially as his principal officer. A true-life prophecy was made foretelling that great Priest and the nature of his work. Nineteen centuries before Christ invaders overran the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, and a great conflict raged between those cities and the invaders. Abraham the Hebrew and Lot, his nephew, were there, but they took no part whatsoever in that war. (See Genesis 14:1-12.) After that war between the contending nations was all over, the invaders seized Lot and his property and fled with the same. Abraham pursued the invaders and recovered Lot, his nephew, not because he was his nephew, but because Lot was a faithful servant of Almighty God. Thus the divine rule was first established that one of God’s devoted servants is justified in acting in behalf of his fellow servants, the servants of God. The rescue of Lot accomplished by the armed forces of Abraham was fully approved by Jehovah God, as shown by what followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Abraham was returning from rescuing Lot he was met by Melchizedek, who was then king of Salem [“Peace”], which position means that he was the king of peace, whereas his name “Melchizedek” means “King of Righteousness”. He gave Abraham nourishing food and drink, serving him with bread and wine, and caused Abraham to be comforted and blessed. To quote Genesis 14:18-20: “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he [Abraham] gave him tithes of all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That prophetic drama foretold the coming of a Mighty One who would fill the office of Priest of the Most High God and who would minister life-giving portions to the peoples of the earth. Jesus Christ fulfilled this prophecy and is God’s great High Priest and chief executive officer for ever, and he gave unto the people that which will bring and sustain life. (Rom. 6:23) Being God’s chief executive officer, he does and will perform all things for Jehovah and in the name of Jehovah. Concerning this it is written, at 1 Corinthians 8: 6, that ‘all things are from Jehovah and all things are by Christ Jesus’. (2 Cor. 5:18) The prophecy concerning Melchizedek shows also that the great High Priest who fills that office is at the same time the great King or Ruler in Jehovah’s Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a reason, of course, why Abraham came ir. contact with Melchizedek. Concerning this the apostle Paul writes, at Hebrews 7:1-6: “For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him , to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation [of his name] King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of Peace, . . . made like unto the Son of God, abideth a priest continually. Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils [of victory]. And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the [Jewish] priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law [of Moses], that is, of their [Jewish] brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: but he [Melchisedec], whose descent is not counted from them [the Levites], received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.” Then Paul comments on this, saying “And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better ” —Verse 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the covenant which God made with Abraham He promised: “In blessing I will bless thee”; and, again, “In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Gen 12 : 1-3) It follows then that Abraham himself must receive a blessing, and what is related in the above scripture concerning Abraham and Melchisedec shows that it is the great Priest whom Melchisedec foreshadowed that bestows the blessing upon all, including Abraham himself, who shall be resurrected from the dead and be made a ‘prince in all the earth’ under the great Theocracy. (Ps. 45:16) This prove.-, that Abraham personally is subordinate to Jehovah’s covenant and also to His royal Priest of the order of Melchisedec</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus was on earth he was anointed to be King and therefore was the King at that time, but he did not assume the office of Ruler at that time. He must wait until God’s due time, which was then future, as Jesus stated to the Roman governor Pontius Pilate according to John 18:36-38. When Jehovah God raised Jesus out of death and exalted him to the highest place in heaven next to Himself, Jesus had then become the Redeemer and the One who makes atonement for sin, and he rightfully holds that title in addition to those of Priest and King Jesus then possessed the power and authority to establish immediately a righteous rule on the earth and take action against the great enemy to oust such enemy from rulership of the world and to perform the work of vindicating Jehovah’s name, and to command all the people to obey. It would have been Jesus’ greatest joy to do so then, had it been God’s due time; but God’s due time had then not yet arrived Therefore Jehovah God said to him as He had foretold through the words of the prophet David, at Psalm 110 1,2, to wit “Jehovah saith unto my lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion.” (A.R.V.) Paul recorded the fulfillment of that prophecy when he wrote, at Hebrews 10:12,13: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting [waiting] till his enemies be made his footstool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above prophetic statement cannot be taken to mean that Jesus must remain idle or inactive when directed to sit down, but must mean that he was to await God’s due time for taking action against the enemy to oust Satan the enemy from the courts of heaven, establish a government of righteousness, and vindicate his Father’s name. There was much other work for him to do in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time must come when God would subdue the enemy. Hence, “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion [God’s organization] : Rule thou [Christ Jesus] in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Jesus Christ, the King, now stands up and assumes his power and authority and begins his reign even while his enemies are still exercising power, although the enemy’s right to exercise that power has expired. Necessarily this marks the beginning of the battle in heaven by the King of glory, the loyal Son of God, and his angels on one side, against Satan, the old Dragon, God’s disloyal son, and his angels or demons on the other side. It is the fight of God Almighty in heaven against the Devil, the fight being led by God’s beloved Son and the purpose being to subdue the enemy and make the enemy the footstool of Jesus Christ the King.— See Revelation 12:1-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In substance, Jehovah says: “This is my fight. I am going to accomplish this work for you and those who shall willingly follow you.” No Christian who is a member of “the body of Christ” would be willing to follow the King Christ Jesus to battle until God’s due time, because he must be in harmony with the will of God When the battle in heaven begins, then is the time for the fulfillment of the third verse of Psalm 110, which reads: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” They are now willing because the due time has come for Jesus Christ to take his power and begin his reign , therefore they joyfully follow him. This is exactly in harmony with the prophetic statement in Revelation 19. 11, 14 “And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.” “And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean ” It is the “woman”, God’s organization, that gives birth to The Nation , out from her comes the Kingdom. The birth of The Nation must necessarily take place at the time when Jesus Christ, the great King, stands up and assumes his regal power. As an illustration, the American nation was born at two o'clock in the afternoon of July 4, 1776, at which time the people, through their duly constituted representatives, assumed the power of government. For several years thereafter they warred against the enemy, who was in wrongful possession of their country. Likewise, God’s kingdom, the new nation, was born of God’s “woman” at the tune when Jesus assumed his power to reign, but after that the great fight takes place and continues until the enemy is ousted and made the footstool of the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the evident purpose of identifying who is doing the work in Jehovah’s name the psalmist says further, at Psalm 110:4: “Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” (A.R.F.) Melchizedek w<sup>r</sup>as a priest of the great Most High. He pictures the One who is bringing everything into harmony with God Almighty. Therefore Melchizedek is a type of The Word, or Logos, of Jesus, of Christ Jesus, of the Redeemer, of the Prophet, of the Priest and of the King. Stated in briefer phrase, Melchizedek is typical of the great Executor of Jehovah’s purpose. As King and Ruler he clears out the enemy, and as Priest he ministers unto those who desire comfort. God is subduing the enemy and making him the footstool of his beloved Son, and the Lord Jesus is his executive officer in carrying out the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where two armies are in action and one charges the other and strikes through the ranks, the one striking through usually gains the victory and destroys the opposing army and takes as prisoners the soldiers of the vanquished army. This is exactly what is pictured by verses five and six of the 110th Psalm, to wit: “The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath He shall judge among the [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads o\er many countries.” Jehovah is here shown at the right hand of Christ Jesus and as using Christ as his great Arm and Power to destroy Satan’s organization. The time is shown to be in the day of Jehovah’s wrath. This, then, is surely “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” -Rc\ .16.14</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah undertakes the work of subduing the enemy, and in doing so he uses Christ Jesus as his mighty Field Marshal to lead the fight. Psalm 45 : 3-6 pictures this mights Field Marshal, fully equipped for the great battle, with his sword on his thigh, clothed with glory and majesty, riding prosperously and to certain victory The time has come for him to take his throne for ever, and the scepter, or authority for taking the kingdom, is Ins by rniht</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This great and victorious warrior and right fid Ruler is pictured at Revelation 19:11-15 as going forth to judge and to make war. In exact harmony therewith the psalmist (110:6) says: “He shall judge among the [nations] , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ” The judimicnt of God is upon the nations; and this must continue until the final conflict, the great time of trouble which w ill end the day of God’s wrath. Concerning the great day of God’s w rath the prophecy says: “A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts. Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried , they shall be dung upon the ground.”—Jer. 25- 31-33</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“He will strike through the head in many countries ’’ (Ps 110:6, A/l.V.) “He . . . hath crushed the head over a wide land.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham Psalms)</span><span class="font3"> Since this is Armageddon, the battle of God Almighty against Satan’s organization, and since to “wound”, “strike through,” and ‘•crush’' means to render inactive or to subdue, and since “the head” well represents the power to direct the forces of the enemy, the Lord will “wound” Satan, the head over the wicked nations, and will subdue him and bind him, and this he will do in the great and final conflict. (Rev. 20 1-3) In Genesis 3:15, addressed to Satan that old Serpent, it was said concerning God’s “woman” (God’s organization, which gives birth to the Kingdom) that “her seed” (Christ Jesus) “shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” This means that Satan, the head of the anti-theocratic enemy organization, is to be bruised. Speaking to the members of the body of Christ, who compose the true church, the apostle Paul says: “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” (Romans 16:20) The apostle John writes: “For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.” (1 John 3: 8) Thus it was the purpose of God from the beginning to use his beloved Son to destroy the works of his disloyal, treacherous son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Summing up the 110th Psalm: After Jesus had finished his great sacrifice and ascended on high Jehovah seated him at His right hand and directed him to remain inactive against the Devil’s institutions until his due time, at which time God would make the Devil the footstool of the King of glory. The due time arrived at the end of the “times of the Gentiles”, in A D. 1914, and then Jehovah sent forth out of His organization his beloved Son to rule amongst his enemies The first work to be done was to subdue the enemy. The battle began in heaven. This fight was completed, and Satan and his demons were ousted from heaven Now the Lord Jesus Christ is the great antitypical Melchizedek priest and, as the Executor of the divine purpose, goes forth to destroy Satan’s organization and to minister to the people of good will. The members of the body of Christ willingly and joyfully participate in Jehovah’s “strange work” as the witnesses of Jehovah and as publishers of his Theocratic Government under Christ the King. Jehovah is now at the right hand of the Lord Jesus Christ and is acting through this his beloved Son, his Arm, who shall strike through the Devil’s organization in the day of His wrath and will take Satan captive in the great time of trouble and wound his head. (Heb. 2:14) While the Lord Jesus Christ is executing his Father’s purpose in this behalf he is greatly refreshed and blessed by the experience and he greatly rejoices because the time has come to vindicate his Father’s name, oust the Devil, destroy the Devil’s unrighteous works, and erect God’s Theocratic Government of righteousness. The members of the body of Christ likewise appreciate the privilege of doing Jehovah’s will, participating with Christ Jesus m declaring the day of the vengeance of our God and announcing the incoming of his kingdom, and they are made joyful in the Lord. They, together with their earthly companions, the people of good will, look up and lift up their heads because their own deliverance is nigh and because the tune for the blessing of obedient men has come.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ABOARD “LADY NELSON&quot;, ST. JOHN (N.B.) HARBOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“On account of war measures no one is allowed to go aboard ship except crew and passengers. However, I met three sailors on the dock from British Guiana. They listened to the phonograph attentively. Being broke, they could not contribute, but I gave them a booklet apiece, also a sample copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> These fellows were Catholic; said they would have some money next day, and to come to the ship and they would get some books. I took them at their word and appeared next day. Being unable to get on board, one of the seamen located one of these fellows for me after about twenty minutes. This Catholic offered to take the literature aboard and see who desired to get some of the books. So I let him take the literature and he went aboard, and I waited, and waited, and thought he would never return. But, much to my surprise, back he came all smiles: he had placed five bound books and a number of booklets, all the literature I had given him except a few booklets. He also brought back a fellow who wanted to hear the recorded lecture. There were about sixteen on the dock, and they remarked about the truth of the record. This fellow he brought back took </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> and the Catholic fellow, after taking </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font3">for himself, said he wanted the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> I being out of literature, we both walked to the ear a quarter of a mile away to get </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font3"> On showing him some of the foreign literature he spied </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> in German and said if he had known that, he would have taken it to a German fellow on board. I said he still could; so back we go to the ship. The German sailor was sleeping, but he woke him up and presented the book to him. The young Catholic told me all about it and was quite enthusiastic over the literature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">70-YEAR-OLDER GOES TO RURAL SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This publisher past seventy years old (in the small town of Burlington, Mich.) does all his witnessing on foot, walking many miles a day working rurals. One afternoon he came to a white house with lots of windows, but, taking no particular notice, he knocked at the door. A young lady answered, inviting him in. Upon entering, he noticed many coats and hats hanging on the wall, the thought coming to his mind that the lady must have many children. After witnessing and placing a book with the lady, who identified herself as the school teacher, he went into the country classroom and spent about half an hour telling all the school children about the Kingdom and gave each of them a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> to take home. His February report is as follows: 46 books, 176 booklets, 86 hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOW ALL’S DIFFERENT IN LOUISIANA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We have been having considerable arrests in the city of Lafayette, due to the priest’s telling the parishioners (colored), when Jehovah’s witnesses come to their doors to call the police. The results: arrests and interference. Recently, when witnessing in this city, a man told me the priest is now telling his parishioners that they made a fool of him, for they told all whom they met that he instructed them to call the police when Jehovah’s witnesses call at their doors: 'Don’t do that any more; leave them alone, don’t bother them; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">politely</span><span class="font3"> tell them you are not interested, do not care to hear the phonograph, do not want any of the books either, and they will quietly walk away and leave you.’ Result: People of good will are waking up to their privileges and seeking meekness in regard to a knowledge of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO WAS INSANE, PRIEST OR PARISHIONER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This lady of Penasco, New Mexico, got some of the books from one of the witnesses. At that time she was a very devout Catholic, both herself and family. She is unable to read either in English or in Spanish, but she was able to study the different pictures in the books and by the aid of her daughter reading some to her from the books she got enough truth to see that the Catholic church is a racket She began showing the books and booklets to her neighbors and friends. The priest worked through her husband and got her declared insane, and she was kept in the insane asylum at Las Vegas, N. Mex., for three months. During that time her husband read some of the books for curiosity. He saw the truth and went to the authorities at Las Vegas and told them that he wanted his wife to be turned loose as he was the one that was crazy instead of his wife. He finally got his wife released, and now he and she and daughter are reading the books, taking </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> in Spanish, and she and her daughter have a phonograph and are using it in God’s ‘strange work’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SMITH WAS “NOT IN” TO RELIGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The man answering the door said Mr. Smith was not there. I told him I had a wonderful Bible lecture which would take only 4½ minutes to hear. He hesitated, then invited me in. As I was setting up the machine, he told me he had no use for the churches. I told him this was not of the churches but would tell him just what religion is. He informed me that regardless of what that record said or I said, there was only one man that he thought was giving the people the truth and that was a man by the name of Judge Rutherford. Smilingly I asked who he thought the speaker was on the record I was about to play He did not have any idea. I informed him it was the very man he said was telling the people the truth. After that he was all ears After the lecture he said: ‘I told you a lie. I told you Mr Smith was not home. I am Mr. Smith, whom you asked for in the first place, but I thought you were from some church or from “Father Coughlin”, and I did not want to have anything to do with you.’ To show his hatred of religion, he told me that if I wanted to do any gambling, he could take me to a preacher who would accommodate me He told me if I wanted any bootleg liquor, this same preacher would sell me all I wanted He told other things about two preachers he knows personally not fit to print After seeing these things with his own eyes, no wonder he hates religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DESTRUCTION OF MAGAZINES OPENS WAY TO PLACE more</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Near the entrance of a large office building, Providence. R.I. A man walked slowly by and over to the entrance, then came back and took a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> handing the publisher a dime. He would not accept the change, so she gave him another copy of an earlier date. He went into the building In about twenty minutes he came back out and said: ‘Give me a copy of everything you’ve got. I just laid my magazines on my desk a minute ago, and a Catholic fellow in the office got hold of them and tore them up.’ The publisher supplied him with two more copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and two of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> He contributed for them, rolled them up carefully and said, ‘No one is going to tear these up: I’m going to see to that; there’s good stuff in them, and I am going to read them.’ ”</span></p>
