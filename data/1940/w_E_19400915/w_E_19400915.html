<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and Is the rightful King of the world ; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth’’ with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>EHUD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Teach me thy way, 0 Jehovah; I will walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy name.&quot; —Ps. 86:11, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH the Almighty God and Christ Jesus are one. Said Jesus: “I and my Father are one.” (John 10: 30) Jehovah God is the Father; Jesus is the Son. Jehovah is without beginning and without end, therefore “from everlasting”. (Ps. 90:2) Christ Jesus is the beginning of Jehovah’s creation. (Rev. 3:14; John 1:1-3) Furthermore Jesus said: “My Father is greater than I.” (John 14:28) How, then, are the Father and the Son one! In this: that they are in full harmony and complete unity. They work together in exact harmony or unity. The Father and the Son are in complete unanimity, or oneness. Christ Jesus the Son always obeys the will of Jehovah God: “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” (John 6: 38) “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40:8) Jehovah is the great Theocrat. Christ Jesus is the King acting for The Theocrat. The Theocracy is the government of Jehovah performed by and through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> It therefore follows that in The Theocracy everything must be in exact harmony, unity or oneness with Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Jehovah God has given to the Son those who compose the members of his spiritual body. These consist of 144,000 and are made up of the faithful apostles and thereafter those who believe, obey and are brought into the “body of Christ” and prove themselves faithful, even unto death. (Rev. 2:10) All of these must be in full harmony and unity, as stated by Jesus: “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”—John 17: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’This language of Jesus clearly settles the matter, that the oneness means full and complete unity in action. Such was the mind of the apostle who under inspiration said concerning the selection of the members of the body of Christ: “Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; . . . But, speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.” (Eph. 4:13-15) Therefore Jehovah, Christ Jesus and all others who have to do with The Theocratic Government must be fully united, all working in God’s organization under the direction of the Head thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> Over a long period of time Jehovah made and recorded in the Bible many prophetic pictures for the purpose of enabling those on the earth at the present time who love and obey him to see and appreciate the development of The Theocratic Government. Among those prophetic pictures was one in which Ehud played a prominent part. That prophetic drama is here discussed for the edification of God’s people. Its fulfillment is now in progress, nearing a culmination, and is therefore of great interest to those who trust fully in the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah is “the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort”. In the time of greatest stress he comforts those who fully trust in him and who serve him with zeal. Just now the anointed remnant and their companions are sorely oppressed by the enemy, yet not dismayed nor discouraged. Europe has been overrun by the instruments of Satan acting under the leadership of Gog the demon and other associated demons. On the continent of Europe the “strange work” of Jehovah immediately preceding his “strange act” appears to be about done. In Britain and America the way of the witness work grows more difficult. Everywhere the great religious organizations, working together with the political and commercial allies, act to carry out their conspiracy to destroy those who are faithfully serving Jehovah. All of these conspirators are against The Theocratic Government, and that is the reason why they persecute Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Throughout the earth today the people of Jehovah who serve him and support his Theocracy with confidence look to Jehovah God and his King and unitedly pray “the Higher Powers” to confound God’s enemies. That prayer that they now breathe Jehovah caused to be recorded in his Word long centuries ago. He makes known to those who love him that the present is the tinje to send up that petition to the throne of heaven. The faithful are therefore shown by the Divine Record to be sending up to the heavenly throne these words: “Keep not thou silence, 0 God; hold not thy peace, and be not still, 0 God. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee. Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison; which perished at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth. As the fire burn-eth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire, so persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, 0 Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish.”—Ps. 83:1-5,9, 10,14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Let it be strictly observed that the prayer recorded in the foregoing text and now put in the mouth of God’s anointed and. devoted people, and which these devoted servants of Jehovah God utter, links together Sisera and Jabin with the Midianites, the antitype of which letter ones are now operating. This time the prayer asked Jehovah that the devastation that he visited upon his ancient enemies be repeated upon those who are now in a conspiracy against the great Theocracy under Christ Jesus, and which Theocratic Organization includes God’s “hidden” people. The overthrow of the Midianites was prophetic. The drama here under consideration involved not only Ehud, but the Israelites, God’s covenant people, the Moabites and others. The drama concerning the overthrow of the Midianites and recorded for the hope of God’s people is to comfort those who are now on earth. (Judges chapters 6-8) (See also </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> 1935, article entitled “Jehovah’s Battle”, pages 3-76.) The record concerning Sisera and Jabin appears at Judges chapters four and five; and by the prayer recorded in Psalm 83, above quoted, these are directly linked with the Midianites. Chapter four of Judges relates to Sisera and Jabin and tells of their defeat, which took place about 47 years before the destruction of the Midianites by Gideon. That chapter four begins with these words: “And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.” (Judg. 4:1) The text here quoted shows a relation to Ehud and what he performed prior thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> The Israelites were then in the land of Canaan, and God had left certain heathen nations there as a test to the Israelites. All those heathen people practiced a Devil religion and were under the influence and power of the demons, of which demon host Satan is the chief. That was a real test upon the Israelites because they were commanded to hold themselves aloof from the Devil religion and worshipers, and to have nothing whatsoever to do with religion. All those heathen nations were against Jehovah and his great Theocratic Government, which his prophetic pictures would foreshadow. “Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them; even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan; only that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath. And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites.”—Judg. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The Israelites fell under the religious influence practiced by the heathen nations there: “And they took their [Canaanite] daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their [Canaanite] gods. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.” —Judg. 3: 6, 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The Israelites had been warned by Moses that religion would ensnare them, but they had failed to give heed to that warning. (Deut. 7: 1-16) Although millions of persons have professed to serve God and Christ almost all of these have disregarded the warning uttered by Moses at the direction of Jehovah and that religion is a snare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Mark here whathas taken place in modern times, which corresponds exactly with what befell the Israelites. Prior to 1918 Jehovah’s consecrated people had agreed to put away all things pertaining to religion and to be obedient to God’s will, but there was no clear and open break made or taken away from religion. There was a measure of religion amongst them, and hence their garments of identification were soiled. When the Lord came to the temple in 1918 the consecrated were identified by many religious ceremonies and practices. Their garments were marked with filthy religious spots. They still indulged in the practice of giving honor and praise to men and submission to worldly rulers as though those worldly rulers constituted the “higher powers” mentioned at Romans 13:1. There was a certain amount of creature worship, exalting and glorifying an earthly leader and thus committing the “sin of Samaria”. (Amos 8:14) There was no real war declared against religion as being of Satan, until the end of 1936. It seems that it has always been very difficult for even the consecrated to keep away from religion and religious practices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Note then that Judges 4:1 says: “And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, when Ehud was dead.” The back reference to Ehud is here made. Ehud had performed his part of a great drama and had died, and the fact that reference is made to his death makes it fitting in this day to examine the history of that drama and its typical meaning, as detailed in the third chapter of Judges, particularly from verses 12-30 inclusive. In that prophetic drama Ehud and his dagger performed an important part.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> At the time mentioned in Judges 3:12, the children of Israel were practicing the Devil religion. At that time there was no judge in Israel. Othniel, who had been judge in Israel, had just died. Likewise from A.D. 1878 and onward to 1918 was a time of preparing the way before Jehovah before the coming of the great Judge sent by Jehovah. Then the Lord Jehovah straightway sent Christ Jesus, the Judge, to the temple to judge the professing Christians, and also the hypocritical practitioners of “Christendom”, who claim to be servants of God. The coming of Christ Jesus to the temple took place in A.D. 1918.—Mal. 3:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Referring now to the drama, note that it is written : “The Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of [Jehovah].” Their evil consisted of practicing religion. Moab was a son of Lot, who was a nephew of Abraham, the great grandfather of Israel, for whom the nation was named. That made the Moabites distant cousins of the Israelites. The practice of religion by the Israelites had reduced that nation to great weakness. They did not have the favor of Jehovah. The Moabites occupied the country east of the Jordan and were strong and became more aggressive. Moab in that prophetic drama appears to foreshadow the religious leaders that practice for hire, that is, the religious, commercial, political class that adopt and practice religion for a selfish purpose. These compose the religionists that rule the land known as “Christendom”. Just before the Israelites crossed over the Jordan river into Canaan Balak, the king of Moab, hired Balaam the unfaithful prophet, a religionist (and who in modern times would be classed as those of the “fifth column”), to try to bring a curse upon the Israelites, but Balaam failed as to the entire nation.—Num. 22:1-41; 23:1-30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> In modern times many who claim to be fully consecrated to the Lord continue to hold on to religious practices and to recognize and submit to men as the “higher powers”. Such become victims of big business, or commercial financial powers, who, together with those who practice religion as a profession, all adopt religion for selfish reasons, acting under the influence and power of the demons. This combination was pictured by the Moabites.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Concerning the strengthening of Moab, as stated in the Scriptural texts, the evident purpose of Jehovah was to not destroy his people who were sincere and who had been misled; but his purpose was to so deal with them as to open their eyes to their deplorable condition in order that they might see who were their enemies and who was their real friend, and that those of good will might find the way of escape and serve God in spirit and in truth. He had repeatedly told them that religion would be a snare to them; and now he would show them more fully how they had fallen into the snare of the Devil. Even so now in these modern times, those who have held on to religion have had some very trying experiences, which experiences have worked to the good of those who have really loved God and who have been diligent to seek to know and to do his holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Eglon, the king of Moab, prepared to make an assault upon the Israelites: “And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.” (Judg. 3:13) When he gathered together his allies of Ammon and Amalek he invaded the Israelites. He followed the Devil’s tactics by gathering to his aid the political and commercial allies, all practitioners of religion. It has ever been the fixed practice for the commercial and political elements to call into action the religious element when a campaign of conquest is undertaken. In the prophetic picture the Ammonites are used to represent the political element in particular, that forms a part of Satan’s organization among men, and all of which practice a Devil religion. Such are the ones who put the State above God, and who regard the State as that which is to be worshiped as the higher power. In other words, obedience must first be rendered to the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The Amalekites appeared to have been the aboriginal inhabitants in the land southwest of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Gen. 14:7,8) The “duke Amalek” was the grandson of Esau. (Gen. 36:15,16) When the Israelites were journeying from Egypt to the land of Canaan the Amalekites were the first to attack the Israelites. For that inexcusable and unjustifiable assault upon the Israelites, the covenant people of God, the Almighty decreed that the Amalekites must be destroyed. (Ex. 17:8-16) Such appears to be Jehovah’s fixed rule concerning all those who without just cause or excuse attack his chosen people. In the time of Queen Esther, by the hanging of Haman and his sons and the slaughter of their allies God’s purpose concerning the Amalekites was accomplished.—See Esther chapters 7, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Amalekites were used in the prophetic drama here under consideration at this point to represent the religious element. Religion was the first or aboriginal element of Satan’s visible organization, and commerce and politics were added later, all three elements following the Devil religion.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The record is that these allied invaders under King Eglon crossed over the Jordan river and attacked “the city of palm trees”. Jericho had been called by that name, “city of palm trees.” (Deut. 34: 3; Judg. 1:16; 2 Chron. 28:15) But at the time under consideration here Jericho had been thrown down to the ground by the power of the Lord when Joshua led the Israelites in a march around its walls. The city of palm trees must therefore have been set up in the vicinity of the site of Jericho amidst the palm trees, hence the name. Previously Jehovah had performed one of his greatest miracles in there destroying Jericho.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> When Eglon went into the land of Canaan and set himself up at the city of palm trees Joshua had been dead approximately one hundred years. The Israelites had in that time degenerated by reason of embracing religion, contrary to Jehovah’s positive command and warning. They had been ensnared by the Devil, using religion as the means thereof. Now Jehovah permits the place of fame, the palm tree vicinity, to fall into the hands of heathen invaders. The Israelites had chosen to follow the Devil’s devices, and no longer was Jehovah fighting their battles for them. They must have some trimming that might result in their good. Jehovah had previously vindicated his name at the “city of palm trees”, that is, Jericho, but the Israelites had forgotten that. Palms symbolize those who grow straight and upright. (Ps. 92:12; Jer. 10:5) The people of Israel were not then of that class, because of their turning to religion. They had forgotten their covenant to be obedient to God; and hence their unhappy condition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Note the condition that existed in “Christendom” about 1917 and 1918. The nations were at war. The religionists were advocating and fully supporting that war. There were those who were like unto the palm tree, trying to stand upright for the Lord and for the honor of his name. Most of them, however, showed fear and continued to hold on to some things religious like “Christendom”, which is entirely religious. Those who were desirous to and somewhat attempted to be straight with the Lord were showing great honor and praise to the name of a man who had been their leader and who had recently died. They were also indulging in religious practices of giving honor and undue praise to other men known as “elders” in the church. They were advocating and indulging in creature worship under the name and style of “character development”, thereby attempting to prepare themselves to be fully qualified while in the flesh to go to heaven. They were neglecting to engage in the service of Jehovah by bearing witness to his holy name and to his kingdom. They were also recognizing the giving honor to human rulers as though they were the “higher powers”, thereby ignoring Jehovah and Christ Jesus, the real “Higher Powers”. That was the time for the beginning of the ingathering of the “great multitude”, foreshadowed by the waving of the palm branches at the feast of ingathering. (Rev. 7:9, 10) The combined enemy opposing The Theocracy was and is made up of religion, politics and commerce under the command of their father the Devil, and this conspiring enemy tried to head off the work of God’s people in bearing testimony to the name of the great Theocrat and in the carrying of his message to those of good will that will compose the “great multitude”. Because the consecrated ones had shown fear and had neglected their covenant with God and had held to religion and religious practices, Jehovah permitted them to be overrun for a time by the enemy. God had not cast his consecrated ones entirely aside, but they must now be disciplined and prove their integrity under the test: “Whom the Lord loves he disciplines, and scourges every son whom he receives.” (Heb. 12:6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> By the discipline that came upon them in 1917 and 1918 some of the consecrated learned to devote themselves entirely to Jehovah and his kingdom. Some time was required for even such devoted ones to fully appreciate their obligation by giving themselves wholly and completely unto the service of the Lord. The consecrated had the experiences, and these trying experiences or ordeals had to come upon them before they fully appreciated that religion is a snare to everyone who practices it. Today God’s consecrated people appreciate, as never any people on the earth before, that religion is a snare of the Devil and employed as a racket amongst the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Turning now to the prophetic drama, note the words recorded: “So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.” (Judg. 3:14) During that period of eighteen years of the reign of Eglon, the king of Moab, he manifested great arrogance. It is written of Moab: “He magnified himself against the Lord. . . . For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skip-pedst for joy. . . . We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud,) his loftiness, and his arro-gancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. I know his wrath, saith the Lord; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.”— Jer. 48:26-30.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> For eighteen years the Israelites were held in servitude to that arrogant king of Moab. Those eighteen years of servitude well foreshadowed the modern-day servitude, though not necessarily eighteen years in which the Lord’s people were in servitude. The consecrated children of Jehovah were in a measure of servitude to the religionists of “Christendom”, which servitude was from 1914, the beginning of the World War. Eighteen years thereafter, to wit, in 1932, there was a measure of deliverance from the servitude. The religious arrangement amongst God’s consecrated people of having “elective elders” over God’s people on the earth was exposed and done away with, and God’s sanctuary was cleansed of that anti-theocratic arrangement. —Dan. 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Within the war-mad, demon-controlled “Christendom” the servitude of God’s people became oppressive, particularly in the spring of 1918. In North America the malicious hatred of “Christendom” against Jehovah’s true servants became particularly manifested in that year of 1918. Just eighteen years thereafter, to wit, in the year 1936, further deliverance came. It was then that the Lord made it clearly to appear to his people that religion, including that of “Christendom”, is of Satan, and that God’s true and faithful servants must avoid religion and shun it, if they would receive complete deliverance and salvation. It was in that year that the Lord exposed the religionists as being the modern-day ones who fulfilled that which the Philistines foreshadowed when they were oppressing the Israelites. Also God’s “strange work” was first understood by his people in that same year. Also it is interesting to note that in that same year Pacelli, now the pope, visited the president of the United States, who was then making the race for his second term as president. The result of that presidential election is well known to all. It was in that same year that Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions presented a petition to the United States government demanding the free and uncensored use of the radio. Thus they were taking an independent stand and getting free from religion and religious influence.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> The people of Israel, oppressed by the Moabites, cried unto the Lord for deliverance. The faithful spiritual Israelites likewise cried unto Jehovah for deliverance from the oppressive power of “Christendom” to the end that the faithful might serve God and go forward with the witness work without interruption or hindrance. They continued thus to fight for the opportunity of proclaiming a Theocratic message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup><sup>27</sup> In 1929 the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the religionists became even more severe. Many of the workers were assaulted, arrested, haled into courts, and severely dealt with, being fined and imprisoned and otherwise maltreated. This, however, did not stop the faithful, but, on the contrary, caused them to work with even a greater determination and more zeal in bearing testimony to the name of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Looking again to the prophetic drama, note: “But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded; and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.”—Judg. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Likewise the spiritual Israelites, God’s devoted people, cried unto the Lord from 1918 onward. It was in that year 1918 that the work of publishing the kingdom message was practically stopped the world over, and God’s people continued in that inactive condition for some time. Then, in 1922, Jehovah’s witnesses, assembled in convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, understood from the Lord that Christ Jesus was at the temple, and, on learning that, a shout of joy went up, because it meant that God’s disfavor was turned away from them and that he had sent his deliverer. (Isa. 12:1,2) Then with one accord they prayed to God that he would ‘send prosperity’ upon the witness work, the words of which prayer God had previously caused to be recorded and now put in their mouths, as the record shows. —Ps. 118:25.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> In answer to the prayer of God’s devoted people for deliverance and prosperity he sent his beloved Son, the King Christ Jesus, to the temple, and disclosed to his people the presence of Christ Jesus at the temple, where he had been from 1918 onward. Christ Jesus came to judge the faithful and to deliver them from the servitude of religion by breaking the power of religion over them and by showing his faithful people their privilege to engage in God’s “strange work”. He also made known to them God’s will to gather unto himself through Christ Jesus the “great multitude&quot;. (Rev. 7:9-17) Note how the deliverance of the “remnant” from religion and religious oppression, and also the deliverance of the Jonadabs, was foreshadowed in the drama here considered. “The Lord raised them up a deliverer, Eh nd the son of Gera.” Here Ehud pictured Christ Jesus at the time he came to the temple of Jehovah in 1918. The name Ehud means “union”, or “unity”. Note how the words of the prophet apply to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, as set forth in the Psalm: “Teach me thy way, 0 Lord; I will walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy name.” (Ps. 86:11) Note also that Ehud here pictures The Christ, showing that all members of “his body” must be in full union or unity with Christ Jesus and Jehovah in The Theocratic Organization. (1 Cor. 12:12-18, 27) The faithful, consecrated ones, gathered to the temple, there tried, tested, judged and approved, were anointed and gathered unto the Lord, and then he sent them forth to perform service in his name and the name of Jehovah God. The Greater Ehud, Christ Jesus, brought them unto himself, and they were made his representatives and representatives and servants of Jehovah. They were made “one in Christ Jesus”. They were fully and completely anointed as one man. They were sent forth with the “sword of the spirit” to press it against the gates of “Christendom”, which is the modern-day Jerusalem. The prophecy written by Ezekiel here seems not only appropriate but to fully apply to Jehovah’s witnesses who had been anointed and sent forth to participate in Jehovah’s “strange work”; which text reads, to wit: “I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied; ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed fox slaughter. Gather thee together </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(marginal reading)</span><span class="font5"> Make thyself one], go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.”—Ezek. 21:15,16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The apostle Paul definitely fixed the time of the fulfillment and application of this scripture as at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the temple: “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.” (2 Thess. 2:1, 2) Thus the apostle shows the complete unity and harmonious action of Jehovah’s anointed ones. Therefore it is observed that the raising up of Ehud, the deliverer of natural Israel, foreshadowed the sending of the Greater Ehud, Christ Jesus, the Deliverer of the faithful spiritual Israelites, to the temple to deliver these faithful ones from the cruel, political “Christendom”, which practices religion for gain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> That which the Lord has recorded about Ehud, his parentage and the tribe to which he belonged, is of importance. Ehud was the son of Gera. That name means “grain”, especially that which was used as a weight or measure of money. A gerah was the twentieth part of a shekel. (Ex. 30:13) It therefore denoted something very small and insignificant so far as its purchasing power was concerned; and this view is the one held by the enemies of God’s people who think themselves very rich. Ehud’s father was of little value or worth in the eyes of the religionists, and likewise Jehovah is of little worth in the eyes of the religionists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Note also that the earthly parents of Jesus were lowly and of little value or worth in the eyes of the self-important ones. With those arrogant religionists the name of Almighty God was then and is now of little worth or value. They rely upon the traditions of men and on their own importance. As to the earthly parents of Jesus the religionists said of him: 'Can anything good come out of Nazareth!’ (John 1:46) They raised the question of his legitimate birth. As to the reputation of Jesus, contrasted with their own, Jesus said to those self-important religionists at that time: “Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.” (John 8:41) Likewise today Jehovah’s witnesses are also counted of little value or worth. The orthodox religionists regard them as very insignificant and speak of them as members of ‘the very smallest sect or cult’, which originated with a man, and which sect is of very recent organization as compared to the great religious system. (See Professor Elmer T. Clark’s religious comments in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Small Sects in America.)</span><span class="font5"> They ignore the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses have existed on the earth at all times for six thousand years, and that God himself gives them that name. It is cause for increased faith and joy to Jehovah’s witnesses in these days of religious demonism influence to note how Jehovah himself caused all these things to be foreshadowed many centuries ago. Thus Jehovah shows that he has at all times been mindful of those who love and serve him in spirit and in truth. Jehovah never forgets those of his organization who continue faithful and zealous for The Theocratic Government: “Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb! yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon-the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.”—Isa. 49: 15, 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Ehud was of the tribe of Benjamin, and therefore the prophecy uttered by Jacob applied to Ehud, to wit: “Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf; in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.&quot; (Gen. 49: 27) Likewise the prophecy uttered by Moses applies to Ehud, to wit: “And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.”—Deut. 33:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> King Eglon had his chief headquarters in the territory of Ehud’s tribe, that is, in the vicinity of Jericho, which territory the Lord had previously assigned to Benjamin. (Josh. 18:21) Eglon was therefore a foreigner, using his power to harass and oppress the people who were in a covenant with Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob, had failed, and also Ephraim, the favorite son of Joseph, had failed, and therefore the tribe of Benjamin stood in line for the royal honors of the kingdom. (1 Chron. 5:1; Ps. 78:9-11,67,68) In the course of time Saul was made king, and he also failed because of his yielding to demonism or religion, and that spoiled things for the tribe of Benjamin. In like manner the remnant of God’s spiritual Israel are in line for the kingdom with Christ Jesus, the antitypical David, and then those who had in time proved unfaithful and yielded to religion or demonism also became a part of the rejected or “evil servant” and lose all opportunity for the kingdom. Thus is magnified the divine rule that complete faithfulness to The Theocracy is essential to deliverance and everlasting blessings. No one can receive such blessings unless he is in full harmony and unity with the great Theocrat and His King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> Ehud, as stated by the Scripture, was “a man lefthanded”; “who used the left hand as well as the right” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay).</span><span class="font5"> Being both righthanded and lefthanded appears to have been a favor especially given to the tribe of Benjamin: “Among all this people, there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.” (Judg. 20:16) “They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.” (1 Chron. 12: 2) Those fellows were sure shots. Thus favored, Ehud was equipped to meet any attack from either side and also to surprise the enemy by his manner of attack. This must have been important, otherwise the Lord would not have caused it to be recorded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> It must be true that the Lord directed the faithful Israelites in selecting Ehud for this special service. They selected him as their representative to carry “a present unto Eglon the king of Moab”. That was done to appeal to the vanity of Eglon and thus to court favor with the dictator and to gain an audience with him. Ehud did not contribute the present, nor did the present represent any affection or love on the part of Ehud for the king. It was a message, and he was the messenger. The present afforded opportunity for Ehud to get close up to the king and to thereby carry out his well-laid plan of action. The purpose was the vindication of Jehovah’s name in behalf of his covenant people, that the Israelites might be relieved from the oppression of a foreign king who was a dictator and a Devil-religionist.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Ehud played the part in the drama picturing Christ Jesus and also including the members of “the body of Christ” on the earth from and after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the gathering unto himself of the faithful anointed ones who become members of “his body”. In fulfillment of this part of the drama the remnant of God’s people in time woke up to the necessity for real aggressive action. It was in the year 1922 that the remnant began to swing into action in unity and in harmony. At that time the remnant, who composed the “faithful and wise servant” class, were in the temple. Others would be brought in, and these were pictured by Ruth and Esther, who in the antitype later became a part of the remnant. In 1922 the Ruth and Esther class were in bondage to the religious restraint and were oppressed and being held by Babylon, that is to say, “Christendom,” as prisoners. It was the express will of Jehovah that such ones represented by Ruth and Esther should be set free; and to that end The Christ, of whom the members of the remnant of the anointed were a part, received the commission from Jehovah God, which they must perform under the direction of Christ Jesus the Head: “To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them.that sit in darkness out of the prison house.&quot; (Isa. 42:7) The then anointed remnant must carry out their commission from the Lord, as written, to wit: “That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.”—Isa. 49: 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> In addition to those pictured by Ruth and Esther, there was then a “great multitude” of people, that is to say, a company without any definitely stated number, who have a proper heart toward God and who desire to know and to do his will, that must be gathered. They were held by the religionists as prisoners. They were crying unto the Lord, imploring him to help and deliver them from the oppressive measures employed in the religious organization. They were ‘strangers within the gates’. (Ex. 20: 10) They must have opportunity to escape. The Lord prepared the way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> It was a restrained and oppressed class of Israelites that chose Ehud to go to the king Eglon. Someone as God’s instrument must boldly and courageously undertake the job. Ehud willingly undertook the mission. Without a doubt Jehovah raised up Ehud and brought to pass the conditions there existing that it might be possible and necessary for Ehud to go. That would mean that Ehud, in the performance of that mission, would be guided by Jehovah and that, following instructions from the Lord, he would certainly succeed in his mission.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">UAZ® SHALL not surely die.” Not the words of God, J these, but the words of the great deceiver, trying to induce mankind in Eden to do that which their Maker forbade. (Genesis 3:4) Disobedient man dies, which proves that the foregoing words to perfect humankind in Eden were a lie. Why do human creatures die? Because the first man, Adam, willfully sinned by joining the Devil in rebellion against the Creator Jehovah God. AU the human race sprang from Adam; and because Adam became a sinner before he and Eve had children, it naturally follows that all men have been born imperfect and are therefore sinners by inheritance. King David, a man after God's own heart, wrote: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” (Psalm 51:5) The inspired apostle Paul explains: “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Rom. 5:12) Unless provision is made by the Almighty God to save men from death, in time all men would perish. God alone could provide for man’s salvation, and therefore it is written: “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.”—Ps. 3:8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God is under no obligation to provide salvation for any man, because all men are by nature sinners. The salvation of sinful man could bring no profit to Jehovah God. He could well let all men die and then create a new race and by that new race prove the Devil a liar and prove Jehovah’s supremacy. It pleased Him to do otherwise. Acting entirely unselfishly, he has provided for the salvation of man from death. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) That Scripture text is no authority whatsoever for the doctrine of “universal redemption” or “universal salvation” of all sinners, including the Devil himself. Such doctrine is a ruse of the deceiver who said, “Ye shall not surely die,” in order to prevent men from learning the only means of salvation to life. Salvation, according to John 3:16, above quoted, is only to those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ: ‘He that believeth on him shall not perish.’ It follows, then, that those who do not believe on the Lord shall perish. “For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23) Since life is a gift from God, then it can be received from no one else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No man can receive a gift until he first has knowledge that the gift is offered to him, and then he must willingly accept that which is offered, in order for the gift to be completed. Anything that is forced upon another against his will is not a gift. When the gift is offered to man it becomes effective only when that gift is accepted upon the terms offered.—Rom. 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Jesus Christ it is written: “Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4: 12) The name Jesus means “Jehovah is salvation”. That is to say, Jesus is the means by and through which Jehovah God has provided salvation for man to life, and such salvation is granted upon the terms which God unselfishly provides. At the birth of the child Jesus the angel of Jehovah announced to witnesses this message: “Unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:11) How does Jesus Christ become the Savior?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ becomes the owner of the human creatures by right of purchase. The purchase price is the lifeblood of the man Jesus poured out unto death according to the will of Jehovah God his Father. (Isa. 53:10, 12) “For the life of the flesh is in the blood.” (Lev. 17: 11) Jesus willingly submitted to being put to death that he might purchase the human race, and concerning this Jesus said: “Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”—John 10:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Angels are spirit creatures, and men are human and therefore lower than angels. It is written concerning Jesus “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” (Heb. 2:9) “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”—Phil. 2:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus suffered for three and one-half years the contradiction of sinners and was continuously persecuted by the religious sinners, and under these adverse conditions he maintained his integrity toward God. “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things winch he suffered, and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ” (Heb. 5: 8, 9) Concerning the purchase price by which the human race is bought it is written: “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.” (1 Pet. 1:18, 19) The lifeblood of the man Jesus provides the ransom price for man. By right of purchase Jesus is the owner of mankind, clothed with full power and authority to minister salvation from death to human creatures who comply with that which God’s law requires. Jehovah God is the great Savior, because ‘salvation belongeth to God’ and God has made Christ Jesus the “author of eternal salvation”, that is to say, God’s Executive Officer, who ministers the salvation of life to men according to the will of God.—Rom. 5:18; 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Is salvation for all men, whether men desire to have salvation or not? No, it is not for those who do not desire it. Note carefully the words of Hebrews 5:9: Jesus is made “the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him”. Salvation is granted to man according to the specific terms and conditions which God has named in his Word, and one specific condition is, “That whosoever believeth in him [Christ Jesus] should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) There are specific conditions attached to such provision which must be met. God's provisions for man’s salvation could not mean compulsory salvation, but that salvation must be for those who believe, because the promise is to those who believe, that they shall not perish. To perish means to go completely out of existence. It is the love of God that provides for man’s salvation, and hence salvation to those who desire to be saved. Since salvation is the gift of God through Jesus Christ, it follows that no man could gain salvation to life for man. Life is a free gift from God, and those who comply with the terms of the gift freely receive it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Salvation is not provided for everyone. The intelligent creature who willfully and deliberately is the adversary of Jehovah God certainly would not receive salvation to life as a free gift from God. Those humans classed as “goats” at the coming battle of Armageddon shall be everlastingly ‘cut </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">off’</span><span class="font3"> from life, sharing the fate of the Devil. (Matt. 25: 32, 41-46) Lucifer the Devil is a willful and deliberate enemy of God, and his end is destruction. (Isa. 14:19; Ezek. 28:19) Adam, when created, was a perfect man. All the creation of God is perfect, as stated at Deuteronomy 32:4. Adam, being perfect, was intelligent, and he was fully advised of God’s law and the penalty for violating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the adversary of God deceived Eve and led her into sin, but “Adam was not deceived”. (1 Timothy 2:14) He voluntarily joined the Devil in rebellion, and hence he was an intelligent, willful and deliberate sinner. Adam had the privilege of obtaining life everlasting on earth upon condition of his obedience unto God. Adam, being duly informed that willful wrongdoing would mean death and the end of life, deliberately walked into death There is therefore no reason to conclude that he could ever thereafter find redemption and salvation to life. God sentenced Adam to death; and God does not change, declares Malachi 3: 6. That judgment is final and is not subject to being reversed; it must stand forever. God sentenced Adam to death while in Eden, but God deferred the complete execution of that judgment for a time, and that for his own wise purpose. In God’s due time Adam died; which proved the Devil a liar. (Gen. 5:5, 3:4) There is no promise found in the Scriptures that Adam’s redemption and resurrection and salvation will take place at any time. Adam had a fair trial for life and completely failed. If God should provide the second trial or second chance for Adam, that would be a denial of the justice of God’s own judgment against Adam. That is an impossibility with God; as it is written: “He cannot deny himself.” (2 Tim. 2:13) “God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent; hath He said, and shall he not do it 1 or hath He spoken, and shall he not make it good?”—Num. 23:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But with Adam’s offspring born outside of Eden the situation or condition is entirely different. Before Adam sinned he and his wife Eve had not exercised the power and function to bring forth children. It seems that God deferred the complete execution of the judgment of death against man in order that Adam and Eve might bring forth children; which they did. (Gen. 4:1,2,25; 5:3-8) At the time of God’s judgment entered against Adam his children, not having been born, were not on trial for life, and hence they were not sentenced to death. However, when born, they were under condemnation because of inherited imperfection. The imperfect Adam and Eve under condemnation could not bring forth perfect children. Every one of Adam’s children was therefore conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, for the very reason that Adam and Eve were sinners under the judgment of death when their children were conceived. Those children had done nothing before or at the time of birth to make them sinners, as indeed they could not do anything to that end. Their conception and birth was without their knowledge or consent. They became sinners by inheritance; and that is true with reference to every child that has been born on the earth, except Jesus alone. Upon this point of inherited sin Romans 5: 12, 14 is clear, positive and indisputable: “By one man sin entered into the world, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">death by sin</span><span class="font3"> ; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” “Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of [after the manner like or similar to] Adam’s transgression.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Moses was a type or figure prophetic of Christ Jesus, the great Prophet and Savior of man from death. The children of Adam being sentenced by inheritance and being therefore under condemnation, they must in the course of time suffer death and return to the dust, because God could not approve imperfect ones and permit such to live for ever. (Hab. 1:13) God could, however, consistently have mercy upon all who were not willful and deliberate sinners or opposers of Jehovah God. This fixed rule of Jehovah he emphasized in the declaration of his law through Moses to the Israelites, wherein it is written: “He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.” (Heb. 10:28; Deut. 17:2-7) All of humankind, having been born as sinners and under condemnation, must die unless some provision is made for them to live; and God, the Giver of life, is under no obligation to provide salvation. On the other hand, “God is love” (1 John 4 :16) ; and in the exercise of his unselfishness he could show and has consistently&quot; shown mercy to mankind by providing salvation through Christ. Mercy' is loving-kindness extended by Jehovah to those under condemnation (and justly so) and subject to destruction. God has shown mercy to mankind in what manner? By providing redemption and salvation through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to be just must God extend mercy to every creature? No. Those who are willing and deliberate opposers of God would not accept his mercy if extended to them; and certainly God would not extend mercy to such opposers, and he does not. Furthermore, mercy is not the result of the exercise of justice, but is the exercise of loving-kindness when such attribute may be exercised consistently with justice. “As it is written, Jacob have I loved; but Esau have I hated.” (Rom. 9:13) Jacob was faithful and obedient to God. His brother Esau spurned the goodness of God and died without mercy. (Heb. 12: 16,17) Jehovah’s rule of action, or law, is unchangeable. (Mal. 3:6) His mercy is extended to all who comply with his fixed rules. The result to the wicked and unfaithful is stated at Psalm 145:20: “Jehovah preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today all the nations are facing death, this death, however, not being due to inheritance from Adam. At the uni-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">versal war of Armageddon, that is, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” all nations shall die. That “death” of the nations will not be at the hands of other nations, but death administered by the Almighty Power of heaven, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, who constitute “the Higher Powers”. (Rom. 13:1) The battle of that great day of God Almighty will be fought by Jehovah and Christ Jesus, supported by all the holy angels of heaven, pitted against the Devil and other demons and their human supporters on earth who continue on the side of the wicked ones. All the nations suffer the same fate, because all are against The </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Government,</span><span class="font3"> that is, the government or kingdom of Almighty God. At the battle of Armageddon all such nations shall cease for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the trouble in the earth is ever increasing and the suffering of the poor increases, some are manifesting a greater amount of sympathy and consideration for those who on earth represent The </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Government,</span><span class="font3"> while others are becoming more unreasonable, harsh, goatish, toward the Lord’s “poor”, the “poor in spirit”. Jehovah indicates what class he will favor in this time of trouble which culminates in Armageddon, saying: “Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth.” (Ps. 41:1, 2) The Scriptural evidence is that a “great multitude” will be brought alive through the battle of Armageddon, and these, the “other sheep” of the Lord, will on earth for ever inherit the blessings under the Kingdom or</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’Theocratic Government.— </span><span class="font3">Rev. 7 : 9-17; John 10:16; Matt. 25: 31-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first world ended with a great flood, in which a few persons, to wit, eight, were saved by being carried over in the ark from the old to the new organization which followed and which God established immediately after the Flood, under Noah. This was an example or picture representing the passing away of the “present evil world” and showing that the “great multitude” of the Lord’s “other sheep” will be carried over from the old to the new. When God had delivered Noah and his family from the perils of the deluge and Noah builded an altar before the Lord and offered a sacrifice, the Lord made promise to Noah, saying: “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; . . . neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease.” (Gen. 8: 21, 22) As Ecclesiastes 1:4 declares that “the earth abideth for ever”, this statement to Noah is a positive promise that the earthly survivors of Armageddon, if continuing obedient to the Kingdom, may live happily on earth for ever. Seeing, then, that we are at the end of Satan’s world and the opening of the long-promised “world to come”, “world without end,” and further seeing that according to the Scriptures many will pass over to the new world, escaping death at Armageddon, it can be confidently announced that a “great multitude” now living will never die, because, these being offered Kingdom blessings, they will joyfully accept them and be obedient to </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was Jesus who said: “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” (John 11:26) After Armageddon the living ones, the earthly survivors, who are not in a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice, but who believe on the Lord, shall not die. To believe means to act upon that belief, in accordance with it, and to be obedient to the Kingdom under Christ that the Lord Jehovah establishes over the earth. Furthermore Jesus the King said: “If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.” (John 8:51) Men cannot keep the sayings of Jesus until they hear them We have now entered the Lord’s due time to hear, and the message of the Kingdom is being declared by Jehovah’s witnesses, and the “great multitude” are hearing and acting in harmony with the message and are therefore in line for life. They joyfully hail the great Theocrat Jehovah and his anointed King, of whom it is written : “For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” (1 Cor. 15: 25, 26) “And God himself shall be with them, and be their God And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.” (Rev. 21:3,4) Let all persons of good will yet in Satan’s world organization now be diligent to heed the Lord’s admonition to Lot: “Escape for thy life.”— Gen. 19. 17.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>TRUMPET SEVEN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font3"> TRUMPET would imply a public proclamation. In the seven years, 1922 to 1928, seven annual proclamations of highest public interest were sounded forth from seven successive annual conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses, the seventh being in Detroit, Michigan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It seems certain that the seventh trumpet would proclaim events of the greatest importance coming to pass. The greatest doctrine of God’s Word is his kingdom, because the kingdom will vindicate the word and name of Jehovah. God’s great drama has moved forward orderly, and each event exactly on time in harmony with his schedule. “And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom [right of rulership] of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.” (Rev. 11:15, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> “The world” here means the new world beginning, which world did begin in A.D. 1914, because it is then that “the times of the Gentiles” ended and Christ Jesus, whose right it is to rule, came into power —Luke 21:24, Ezek. 21: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God sent his angel to carry out matters of great importance as pertaining to his people on earth He caused his representatives or deputies, who are invisible to men, to direct what should be done by his visible servants and witnesses on earth. This is further proof of the completeness with which Jehovah keeps in his hand all his work Everything is in His right hand ; and he directs his servants, and they act according to his sovereign will. No creature can properly take credit for what is done, whether that creature be an invisible angel of heaven or some earthly servant Recall that when God sent his angels to deal with some of his earthly creatures the angels’ names were not disclosed. These angelic creatures, far greater than man, kept their names secret from man. The manifest purpose was that all glory and honor should be given to God. This must mean that the creature shall take no credit to himself for what he is privileged to do.—See Judges 13:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If it appears, then, that God’s people on earth have been used by the Lord to perform certain things in connection with fulfillment of his prophecy, let these facts cause them to humbly fall before Jehovah God and give him all glory and all honor. Let no flattering titles or honor be given to men, for such is not pleasing to the Lord. (Job32:22) God’s people can today see where they have made this great error many times in the past; but henceforth let them be warned and hereafter give all the glory and honor to God, and none whatsoever to men, and thus avoid religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From Julv 30 to August 6, inclusive, 1928, Jehovah’s witnesses held a convention at Detroit, Mich. In that convention were consecrated men and women from many countries of the earth, speaking many tongues and languages. The religious clergy and their allies used every power at their command to keep the people in ignorance of the fact of this convention and to deter persons from attending. They would have prevented the shouting of the multitudes who did attend, if they could; but they could not. Satan and his agents have not power to prevent anything that God wills to have done. That was a service convention the general purpose of which was to make known the kingdom of God. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Society</span><span class="font3"> published its own newspaper for the occasion, called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font3"> which gave a daily report of the events of the convention. From </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font3"> the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘The most important event that ever happened in Detroit, or in Michigan, or in the United States, or on the American continent, or in the world, takes place this morning at 9:30 when an address will be given on “Ruler for the People”, over the greatest network of radio stations ever linked together in human history. . . . The wire network of these stations covers 33,500 miles of telephone lines, and 91,400 miles of telegraph lines. More than 500 telephone experts will superintend the network.’ The New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font3">said: ‘The most extensive and expensive radio hook-up in history has been arranged for the International Bible Students next Sunday at Detroit. The speaker is an uncompromising foe of organized Christianity.’ The Washington (D.C.) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font3"> on August 6, said: ‘The broadcast of Sunday morning’s session of the International Bible Students Association, assembled yesterday morning in Detroit, included more than 100 stations, and therefore was the largest in the history of radio. . . . For the convenience of listeners in the Capital loud-speakers were installed in the Pythian auditorium, and at several other points in the city. The visible audience in the Detroit auditorium numbered more than 12,000. In addition to that, loud-speakers were placed in Belle Isle Park, about ten miles away in Detroit, where it is said another crowd assembled.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most important period of the convention was the Sunday morning session, August 5. Assembled at the Coliseum were upward of 12,000 earnest followers of Christ Jesus. The radio stations linked together numbered one hundred and seven, covering all parts of the United States and almost all of Canada, and with shortwave channels carrying the message to foreign lands. There were many consecrated people assembled in similar groups at various points with loud-speakers installed, that they might listen to the radio; and therefore these similar groups formed a part of the convention and had a part in its proceedings. At the appointed hour a resolution was read setting forth in substance that Jehovah, the only true God, is the true Friend and Benefactor of mankind; that Satan’s world or rule without interference by Jehovah has ended; and that Jehovah has placed his beloved Sen Christ Jesus upon his throne to rule the world, though his enemies yet operate; and then the resolution called upon all nations and peoples to give their allegiance to God’s kingdom. Then followed the speech in support of the resolution, the title of which was “Ruler for the People”. At the conclusion thereof the resolution was enthusiastically adopted by a vote of the seen and the unseen radio audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DECLARATION AGAINST SATAN AND FOR JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Bible Students in international convention assembled do declare themselves against Satan and wholly for Jehovah of hosts, and emphatically announce further these vital truths, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“First: That the peoples-of earth organized into forms of government and under the control of a superior and invisible ruler constitute the world;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Second: That Jehovah is the .only true and Almighty God and the source of all just authority; that he is the King Eternal, the God of justice, wisdom, love and power and the true Friend and Benefactor of all creation ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Third: That Jehovah delegated to his son Lucifer the authority to be the overseer of man; that Lucifer became disloyal, rebelled against God and caused man to fall away from righteousness, and since that rebellion Lucifer has been known by the titles Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil; that Satan the Devil has caused strife amongst the nations and is responsible for all the cruel wars, wicked murders, all heinous crimes and other corrupt acts that have been committed; that until now Jehovah has not restrained Satan from the exercise of power and influence over man, that for many centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the world, constantly defaming the name of Jehovah God and working great injury to men and nations;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Fourth: That Jehovah promised that in his due time he would restrain Satan and establish a righteous government in the earth that men might have an opportunity for life everlasting in happiness; and to that end he anointed his beloved Son Jesus to be the Redeemer and invisible Ruler of the world;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Fifth: That Jehovah’s due time has come to fulfill his promise and to clear his reputation in the minds of all creation; that Christ Jesus has taken his high office as the executive of Jehovah and the great issue now is, Who is God, and who shall rule the peoples and nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Sixth: That because Satan will not surrender his wicked rule over the nations and peoples of the earth, Jehovah of hosts with his anointed executive officer Christ Jesus will press the conflict against Satan and all of his forces of evil, and henceforth our battle-cry shall be, THE SWORD OF JEHOVAH AND OF HIS ANOINTED; that the great battle of Armageddon soon to begin will result in the full restraint of Satan and the complete overthrow of his evil organization, and that Jehovah will establish righteousness in the earth by and through Christ, the new Ruler, and will emancipate mankind from evil and bring everlasting blessings to all the nations of the earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Seventh: Therefore the due time has come for all who love righteousness to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and obey and serve him with a pure heart, that they may receive the boundless blessings which the Almighty God has in reservation for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A full report of the resolution and the supporting address appeared in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> magazine of September 5, 1928. For further report of the proceedings of the radio hook-up broadcasting of the resolution and the supporting argument, see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> September 15, 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As Revelation 11:15 pictures the “seventh angel” as sounding the trumpet, it seems quite convincing that Jehovah God through his angel directed the proceedings at that convention and afforded the opportunity for proclaiming it over the broadest area that any message ever delivered on earth up to that time had been broadcast. On Monday morning following, at four o'clock in the morning, the same resolution and supporting argument were broadcast by shortwave from Detroit, Michigan, by wire connection with the large station at Schenectady, New York, for the special benefit of Australia, New Zealand and other islands of the sea. Shortly thereafter cablegrams were received from Australia and New Zealand announcing that the reception was splendid and well received. Cablegrams from the islands of Jamaica, Trinidad, and other British West Indies points, likewise reported good reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This trumpet message was an announcement that Jehovah is the King eternal and that he has set his beloved Son, earth’s rightful Ruler, upon his throne. That the Lord directed it there can be no doubt, because no one connected with this convention had thought that its proceedings might be in fulfillment of Revelation 11 15. Nor did such a thought occur to anyone, so far as known, for more than a year thereafter. Psalm 97:1 had declared: “Jehovah hath become king.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font3"> And Psalm 22:28: “For the kingdom is Jehovah’s, and he is the ruler over the nations.” (A.R.V.) ‘Jehovah has set his king upon his throne.’ (Ps. 2:6) Thus the Lord had long ago foretold what he would do; and which he did. The facts show that he set his King upon his throne in 1914, and here was the occasion for causing his people to make a proclamation of that fact to the nations and peoples of the earth. The convention resolution and the supporting address broadcast on that occasion were afterwards put in book form under the title “The Peoples Friend”, and millions of copies in various languages were placed in the hands of the people. At that same convention the book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3"> was released for distribution, and has since been widely distributed throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As stated at Revelation 11:15, to wit, “the seventh angel sounded, and there were great voices in heaven,” the foregoing messages, symbolized by the voices, are and were from heaven because what is stated therein is the Word of God, and not the message of man. The issue is squarely raised, Who shall rule the world ? From that time forward such is the great issue, and God’s anointed witnesses are marching on together with their earthly companions of good will, all with songs of praise proclaiming, ‘Jehovah shall reign forever, by his Christ! Jehovah’s name shall now be vindicated.’ The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font3"> released at that convention and distributed by the millions in many languages, especially emphasizes the fact that Jehovah is the Supreme One, and that his Theocratic government, by and through his anointed King, is the complete panacea for the ills of humankind, and is that which will set the people free, and that therefore God’s government is their great friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the revelation that the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus has begun, united thanks are offered to the great Theocrat, Jehovah, by his anointed witnesses who are in line to sit with Christ Jesus in his heavenly throne. (Rev 3:21) Revelation 11:16,17 shows this under the symbol of the twenty-four elders that sat upon their seats or thrones and that, at the Kingdom announcement, fell upon their faces, worshiping God, and saying: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.” The “twenty-four elders”, being double the number of Christ’s apostles, symbolically represent the kingdom class, those in heaven and those yet alive on the earth, to whom Christ Jesus has said as a reward for their faithfulness: “Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord ” (Matt. 25:21,23) These worship not men, but worship the Supreme One and humble themselves under his mighty hand, as admonished at 1 Peter 2:17 and 5: 6. These say, not merely at prayer and at study meetings, but aloud by speech and by radio and by millions of printed books and by recorded speeches run on phonographs, proclaiming the fact, that God’s kingdom has come. They say that the Lord took his power and began his reign in A.D. 1914, as the Scriptures and modern facts show; and saying this they rejoice and give thanks to Jehovah and delight to become heralds of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has always exercised supreme power over the universe aside from the earth; but now, by and through his beloved Son, He assumes authority over things pertaining to the earth. And with what effect upon the earth? This. “And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth ” (Rev. 11:18) The nations became angry in 1914, at the end of Satan’s world or end of his uninterrupted world rule, Jehovah not having interfered therewith up til) then. Jehovah’s wrath came when his beloved One, Christ Jesus, came to His temple in 1918 for judgment work and the ruling factors of earth rejected him as the world’s rightful ruler and persecuted his witnesses. (Ps. 11:4-6) From the publication of the article “The First Resurrection” in the issue of June 1, 1927, of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> it is established that only after 1918 Jehovah’s people came to a realization of the fact that the faithful Christian saints that had died prior thereto, and had slept in the grave, had been resurrected in such spirit or “first” resurrection about the time of the Lord's coming to his temple. Thus there had come “the time of the dead, that they should be judged”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The record adds: “And that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets” This now applies to Jehovah’s witnesses that serve him and prophesy or preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. The prophets of old could not come into the fulfillment of this before God's faithful remnant of witnesses had been approved and anointed and brought into the temple condition, because concerning the prophets of old it is written: “They without us should not be made perfect.” (Heb. 11:39,40) The “saints&quot; who are rewarded mean the purified ones who are wholly devoted to Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. “Them that fear thy name, small and great,” seems clearly to mean those who now hear the message of truth and turn to the Lord before Armageddon to become the Lord’s “other sheep”, the “great multitude”, that shall survive Armageddon and be forever on the earth.—Rev. 7: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The record further says as to Jehovah God : “And [thou] shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.’’ By his prophet Isaiah (24:5) Jehovah tells of the ruling classes on earth, under Satan the invisible ruler, who have defiled the earth because they have transgressed God’s law, changed his ordinances, and broken his everlasting covenant concerning sacredness of human life. These wicked ruling factors have so corrupted the earth or organization of men on the earth that God will destroy the wicked organization, at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision, at Revelation 11: 19, then discloses the temple of God in heaven opened: “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.” This indicates that the time had come for the awakening out of death of those saints who had died faithful; and also for those on the earth, found faithful to the Kingdom, to be brought into the temple class as approved of the Lord. This would mark the beginning of the fulfillment of the parable of the talents as set forth at Matthew 25:14-30. The opening of the temple would also disclose to those of the temple class what things are therein: “and there was been in his temple the ark of his covenant.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ark of the covenant of Jehovah God is seen in the temple, in heaven; not in any earthly temple. In olden time, in the reign of King David at Jerusalem, the original literal ark of the covenant was transferred from the house of Obed-Edom to the tabernacle King David had erected for it on Mount Zion, and that transfer was the occasion for song and great rejoicing, and a song was composed and sung by David telling of the presence of Jehovah among His people for judgment. (See Psalm 132.) The Scriptures show that the ark of the covenant is a symbol of the presence of Jehovah, and his presence is therefore a time for his people to rejoice. As King David sang: “Arise, 0 Lord, into thy rest ■ thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.”—Ps. 132:8,9; see also Hebrews 9:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The picture of the ark of the covenant, in Revelation 11 19, is that Jehovah, through his representative Messenger, Christ Jesus, has come to his temple, the spiritual temple, and it is time for the approved ones of the temple class to greatly rejoice. “The Lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Hab. 2: 20) The Lord now comes to build up Zion, as represented by his faithful remnant of witnesses on earth, and which building up is pictured by the transfer of the ark of the covenant to Mount Zion: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” (Ps. 102:16) It is therefore the time for his people to say as did King David at the transfer of the ark to Mount Zion: “Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen [the nations], that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.”—1 Chron. 16: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Anciently the location of the ark of the covenant was the place where the twelve tribes of Israel went up and had a rally to give testimony to Jehovah’s theocratic rule According to the Psalm of King David: “Jerusalem is budded as a city that is compact together: whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.</span><span class="font3"> For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.” (Ps. 122: 3-8) Now at this dav Jehovah’s faithful anointed witnesses and their companions must rally to the performance of their covenant to keep his commandments, and in so doing give praise to Jehovah’s name and testimony to the vindication of his name by his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The presence of the Lord as represented by the ark of the covenant in his temple is a time of great shaking and agitation and commotion, all which is symbolically described at Revelation 11:19. This shaking, agitation, and commotion has been particularly true since 1918 with reference to Jehovah’s consecrated people on earth and those who claim to be followers of Christ but who practice religion instead of Christianity. This condition is enhanced by the “lightnings” from the Word of God, or flashes of revealed truth. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah see the light upon God’s Word and rejoice, and those not faithful but who are ensnared by religion become incensed at Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and are shaken out of God’s organization The flashes of lightning from the Lord are fol owed by “voices, and thunderings&quot;, proclamations of the message of truth; and these messages of truth, hard and cutting, like “great hail”, sweep away the covering of lies of organized religion (Isa. 28:17), and Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, together with the “great multitude” of their companions, joyfully proclaim the praises of his name and continue to sing the “new song” of the vindication of his name and of his Theocratic Government under Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTER REBUFF, COURAGE AND SUCCESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Witnessing with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> to judges, lawyers, sheriff, etc., we three pioneers [ladies] came to the City Hall. I went to the police station, to the chief, and said: ‘This is the latest issue and deals with The Flag Case.’ Abruptly he asked: ‘What did you say?’ I began to speak, but he, in almost a rage, broke in, saying, ‘I have heard a lot about this, and the best thing you and your bunch can do is to fold up, quit this work, get off the streets with your magazines and stop your foolish work.’ One policeman was present in the office, but apparently gave no ear to what was going on. The chief nearly yelled: ‘What do you think the American people should do, one-half of them salute and one-half refuse to salute? I fought hard for my country, and then to have a young punk like you come in here and tell me I shouldn’t salute the flag! I ought to knock your head right off . . . [vile and abusive language].’ Said I: ‘I didn’t say you or anyone else should not salute, because everyone has or should have the right and ability to choose for himself.’ The chief threatened me with violence if I did not get out of his office with those magazines and stay off the streets with them and away from the homes, and that if he caught us again he would lock us up, take it up with the mayor, etc. I walked discreetly out. Instead of going from house to house as we had planned, we pioneers then took to working the street corners and business places. The same policeman who was present at the police station when I was there walked by me on the street, but paid no attention to what I was doing. In one hour and forty minutes we had placed, by Jehovah’s loving grace, thirty magazines. Then again in the evening twelve more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PETITIONING FOR FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A new publisher (colored) went out today with the Petition [addressed to the Governor of Ohio in behalf of the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses]. One well-known Catholic in the neighborhood (white) was giving a party at which were gathered about seventeen visitors, all Catholics but two. The man giving the party very recently called at the publisher’s home and said very unkind things about Jehovah’s witnesses. Typical of his religious training, the statements he made were untrue, of which the publisher was well aware. When he saw she could not be moved, he resorted to the usual threats of all the things that ‘eould happen to her’ if she continued to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. To all this she stood firm for the Lord. Knowing about the gathering, she decided she would go there with the petition (this, much to the surprise of her husband), and, as she stated, ‘make them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> take their stand.’ Many nasty remarks were passed: ‘You’re working for Hitler!’ ‘You’re ignorant, that’s why you follow </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">them!'</span><span class="font3"> etc. Finally one woman in the crowd said: ‘You folks don’t know what you’re saying. These people are not for Hitler. I know they are doing a good work. Give me that petition. I’ll sign it, and when you get in that kingdom, remember me.’ Whereupon all the rest signed the petition too. Not only did the man of the house sign it, but he said: ‘Don’t walk any further. You can use my car and ride anywhere you want and get as many names as you can.’ The publisher lost no time, thanked him, took his car, and went on, rejoicing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ENLIGHTENING THE OSTENTATIOUSLY “PATRIOTIC”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“My neighbor, who is very patriotic, allowed a flag to be fastened to the roof of her house on Flag Day, and she has never taken it down. I called on her with the Petition. She proceeded to let me know how against the government Jehovah’s witnesses are. I told her she was not a good American or she would not leave the flag all night, etc. I told her I had the flag code or flag circular from the War Department, the Adjutant General’s office, under date of June 14, 1923, when 68 patriotic organizations met in Washington, under the auspices of the National Americanism Commission of the American Legion and adopted a flag code, and I would loan it to her so she could learn how to respect the flag other than to salute it. I told her the president of the United States was not allowed to salute the flag. She asked why. ‘Because he was the head, and the head could not salute the head, if he did, it would be like the pope’s kissing his own toe.’ The result of this case was that she consented to listen to the recorded lecture ‘Government and Peace’. I have been years trying to play a lecture, get her to read or do something to arouse her. The flag salute and Petition furnished the opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">POLICE ACTION RESULTS IN GOOD WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“On arrival at the police station I was brought before the desk officer, to whom I presented my identification card and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty to Preach.</span><span class="font3"> I told him I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses; at the time I was accosted I was preaching the gospel and am an ordained minister to do this work One of the fourteen officers present asked by what seminary was I ordained. I told him my commission for preaching the gospel came from God’s inspired Word, the Bible, and not from any man-made institution. Then they wanted to know what I had in my ‘brown suitcase’. So I opened my portable phonograph and put on ‘Instruction’. They began to complain, as it wasn’t loud enough for such a noisy place, so they took possession of it and played it themselves, playing ‘Snare and Rocket’, ‘Flag Saluting,’ and ‘Warning’ All these records they played twice, looking for something for which to bring a charge against me Failing here, they began examining my books and booklets, but could find nothing. I then offered them some literature Some took booklets and promised to read them and everyone received an invitation to the zone assembly. One of the plain-clothes officers gave me a dollar and told me to take this to Jehovah. I thanked him for his generosity, but explained that Jehovah is the great provider and doesn’t need any money. With this I packed my books and records and bade them good day. When I asked if they would please return me to the place where I was picked up they said: ‘What do you think this is, a taxi cab station?’ So I walked out and returned to my work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“LOCUST” ON AN OKLAHOMA DOORSTEP</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One man was prejudiced, did not want me to come into the house. When I set up the phonograph on the steps he just barely cracked the door open. As the record so clearly explained the difference between religion and Christianity, the door opened a little wider, and when it was completed and the books were offered to him, he gladly took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.”</span></p>
