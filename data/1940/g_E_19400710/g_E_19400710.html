<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Hierarchy’s Fifth Column</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Two Parts—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font9">EHOVAH, the Almighty God, is now maneuvering the enemy into position for the final war, the battle of Armageddon, The exact hour for this has been set for thousands of years, and it will begin on time. In Eccle-<sub>r</sub> siastes 3, verse 8, Jehovah declares that there is a time of war and a time of peace; at Isaiah 14, verse 24, and chapter 46, verse 11, He declares that He will accomplish all His purposes, “Kpown unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world,” (Acts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15:</span><span class="font9">18) The Lord preserves the righteous, but the wicked are certain of destruction at His hands. (Psalm 145:20) Jehovah hates “a proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[(Leeser)</span><span class="font9"> a heart that contriveth plans of injustice], feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies”.—Proverbs 6:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah foreknew the workings of the Hierarchy and caused this apt prophetic description to be made of them. Note the phrase 'a heart that deviseth plans of injustice’. Several thousands of years ago God foreknew that they would lie about His witnesses and devise plans of injustice, such as labeling them as Fifth Columnists, and plant violence in the minds of Legionnaires and hoodlums in their fight against The Theocracy. In actual fact the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her aids form the Fifth Column or Spy Column of the Murderer-in-Chief Hitler. These facts are particularly presented to those who may have been innocently involved in the attacks.on Jehovah’s witnesses in Texas and elsewhere. Let such pause and review the documented evidence herein, that they may not suffer the fate of the deliberate wrongdoers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Hierarchy is expecting to increase the operations of the Fifth Column in conjunction with the ” Catholic revolutionary movement” of Adolf Hitler. Hitler and the Hierarchy have an identity of design, the reestablishment of the “Holy Roman Empire”, this time to take in the whole earth. To befuddle the minds of the people they are warning them against sueh inroads from the Spy Column. Thus they are making the fire and hollering “Fire” at the same time. To carry out this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font9">ception which is working so much injury on innocent people they have employed the American Legion to denounce Jehovah’s witnesses as members of the Fifth Column, or Trojan horse. This has been especially vicious in Texas, but has also occurred by concerted action in California, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and other places. Everyone who knows Jehovah’s witnesses knows this denunciation is absolutely false. The sufferings of Jehovah’s witnesses in German^ are a monstrous record of infamy against the perpetrators, Hitler and the Catholic Gestapo. But such false accusations of the Lord’s people serve a two-fold purpose: to blacken the Lord’s name and His witness work among the uninformed, and to discredit Jehovah’s exposure of the Hierarchy so that they may calmly carry on their destruction of the democracy of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hitler's Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has never been denied by the Hierarchy that Hitler is a Catholic. It is not likely to -be bragged about, however, until he has ravaged all Europe, and then it will be time for an </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font9">pression of gratitude from the pope and bestowal of the title “Defender of The Faith”. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Ulster Protestant</span><span class="font9"> makes this undeniable (April 1940 issue):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. . . The following facts prove beyond shadow of doubt that Hitler is not a Pagan, but a Roman Catholic: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1) He was baptized a Roman Catholic; (2) he has never left the Roman Catholic Church; (3) he has never been ex-communicated; and (4), what is most significant, he calls himself a Roman Cath-die. Our authority for the last statement is Hitler himself. In the most recent edition of the German </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Who’s Who (Wer Tst’sf),</span><span class="font9"> and in his autobiographical sketch (which, in keeping with the.fuehrer's dignity, pre cedes all the other sketches in the volume), Hitler designates his religion as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">hath. </span><span class="font9">Reference to the table of abbreviations (Ver Keich -nis der Abkuerzungen) shows that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">hath,</span><span class="font9"> stands for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">katholiseh</span><span class="font9">—i.e., (Roman) Catholic, , . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Adolph Hitler was born Roman Catholic, and to carry out his nefarious work has found ready material in sons of the Roman Church. . . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Vaf-itwi and Nazism , , </span><span class="font9">. [is} packed full of interesting facts which show the papal hand which has helped Hitler, who “has always shown a pronounced bias against Protestant Britain”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These facts must be kept in mind in considering the advance of Rome in America. Soon the country is to be deluged with Nazi activities; in fact, is already grappling with the Jesuit Gestapo. Subtly they warn of this in advance to divert suspicion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We have to remember the Fifth Column. We must be aware of our enemies. It is not out of place today to bring to your attention the Fifth Column. For several years it has been operating in America but little was heard of it.” [Father J. A. McCaffrey, in a speech to the New York Rotary Club, quoted by the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font9"> May 24, 1940.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“There will be no fifth column among the Catholics of America, for the Catholic when truest in his faith is truest to the laws of his country.” [William Cardinal O’Connell, in an address “at a solemn high mass in the Cathedra! of ^he Holy Cross”, Boston, Mass., quoted by the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font9"> June 3, 1940.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These two men probably know more about Fifth Column activities than any others not of the same fraternity in America. As to their protestations of innocence the little verse of Thomas Hardy, English, novelist, seems particularly apropos:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ 'Peace upon earth’, was said. We sing it. And pay a million priests to bring it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And after two thousand years of Mass We’ve got as far as poison gas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thomas Hardy did not live to see the more terrible weapons in the pope’s World War II, such as tanks and bombers that can annihilate nations. He did not know of the Blitzkrieg that so delights the heart of Prayerful Pius, the lightning war’ that is bringing the fulfillment of the pontiff’s fondest hopes, a Catholic World Empire. A Catholic sympathizer writing in the editorials of the Fort Wayne </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jour-nal-Gazeite,</span><span class="font9"> April 18, 1940, expresses their real admiration of Hitler:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How They’ve Changed Their Tune</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Adolf Hitler a half-baked rabble-rouser with</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">neurotic tendencies? Th kt’s what his critics used to Say about him, and say no longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Oh, yes, he’s been a shrewd party leader,” other so-called experts formerly stated. “But he knows little about diplomacy, and less about military affairs. He’s a poor judge of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such stuff is just 100 per cent incorrect, as the events of the last seven years—and especially of the last seven months—have convincingly proven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Consider the weapons possessed by Hitler at the very outset, when'he began tinkering with the rusty economic machine of the German nation and the feeble military nucleus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then consider what the man has done since he assumed power on that fateful January day in 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He built a new German army, a new German navy, an air force second to none. He marched into the Rhineland, achieved anschluss with Austria, absorbed Czechoslovakia, grabbed Memel and Danzig, conquered Poland, took Denmark into protective custody overnight, and employed dramatic “Trojan horse” tactics to seize control of Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They said he would be twisted around the little finger of British diplomats. He twisted them around his little finger at Munich. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They thought he would ruin the German armed forces by ill-advised military and naval orders. At present he appears to have the Allies on the run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">They were “certain” Russia would fight on the side of the Allies, and Italy would at least remain neutral. Best current opinion is that both Russia and Italy may end up on the Nazi’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Probably no man in all the world is hated more strenuously than Adolf Hitler, His aims, like-his methods, are distasteful to believers in representative self-government. But weak men are not hated; they are merely despised. Hitler, like Napoleon, is hated. Even more than Napoleon, he has gained every objective sought during his first period of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The worst mistake any man can make is to underestimate his adversary. Hitler’s adversaries underestimated him. They do so no longer, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the present at least, it appears that in the person of this once obscure son of a half-forgotteu Austrian customs official are combined the diplomatic brilliance of a Bismarck and the military genius of a Moltke together with skill in party leadership which cannot be compared with that of any other figure in German history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How pitifully puny the Baldwins and the Chamberlains look alongside Hitler!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hitler and His Church</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Writing in the Boston </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font9"> April 17, 1940, Clement A. Norton, just recently returned from Germany, states that after the occupation of Warsaw Hitler ordered that all church bells should be rung between noon and 1 p.m. for seven consecutive days in commemoration of that event. He stated that in Berlin St.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hedvig’s cathedral church, the one Hitler attends, is thronged and in Munich the Germans parade to church as if nothing had happened. Referring also to the fact that at one time more than 100 Franciscans were on trial formoral rottenness, Norton says, admiringly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Overnight these trials were suddenly called off and only one man' in all Germany could give the, order to halt those trials and that was Hitler. For months the German newspapers front-paged those trials and overnight every one of them was dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Films of Savagery</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Nazis have made a film of the conquest of Poland—a film described by neutral correspondents as a terrible record of massacre. Cameramen accompanied the bombing and reconnaissance squadrons and thus made it possible for civilians thousands of miles away from the scene to see with their own eyes what happens when savage war is made from the sky. The Nazis are proud of this film and they regard it as a most effective instrument. It is an ominous sign that they have pow exhibited it in Sweden. They trust to it to help them in their main purpose, which is to break down the morale of Europe. For the most important fact about this war is that it takes us back to the type of life and the type of hero that the Nazis admire; it. takes us back to the days when Christianity, whose influence on German history they resent as enervating and enfeebling, had not yet softened manners and sharpened conscience. The Nazis set out to convince the world that there is no brutality that they would not commit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“What Hitler, Goring, and Ribbentrop want to impress on the world is that destruction is the fate of any nation that resists the Nazis, and to teach it, that lesson they begin with savagery in cold blood. Methods to which passion may drive a people they use and prepare as calmly as a scientist preparing a chemical experiment.'’—Manchester </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">dust, what infamy Hitler’s Nazis will do and what sympathy for them or affiliation with them implicates is briefly noted in a few dread instances. First is the statement of Eduard Renes, last president of Czechoslovakia, made to the London Press Club, and quoted in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Post.</span><span class="font9"> April 30, 1940:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I do not exaggerate and I have no need to do so. . . . Every political prisoner was questioned alone, while he was at the. same time physically tortured, beaten, a.nd humiliated under such physical. conditions, in unhealthy rooms, with such impossible food, and under such nervous tension that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 10, 1840</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">hardly any left there without being broken for life. Hundreds of Czech officers received such treatment there that they died under the blows of the Nazi police—beaten to death in the most bestial fashion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of the positive atrocities inflicted Dr. Benes said on March 29 that a house in Prague had been turned into a torture chamber where crudities are practiced more terrible than those inflicted on the Jews in concentration eamps.—Manchester </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font9"> April 12, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Perhaps the betrayal of Norway by those whom Norway befriended is more terrible than the carnage of murderous -war.,“Mr. James,” as reported in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> and the Forth Worth </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font9"> “recounts that the Norwegians were surprised by the large numbers of German officers and men in the invading Nazi force who spoke well their language, which is not taught generally in German schools: In explanation Mr. Ja.mes reports” thaf after the World War 1 many Norwegians out of the goodness of their hearts took<sup>1</sup> in many, undernourished children from Germany and Austria. They were voluntarily cared for by Norwegian families without cost to the State, finally, when they attained manhood, they went back to their native lands and returned with the Nazi invaders. Here is the gratitude of a Nazi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is the picture of the subjects of the dictator who said :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. “I shall shrink from nothing. . . . We shall be ruthless. , . . The instrument of terrorism is indispensable, less for its direct effects than for its undermining of the opposing will. . . . There is no such thing as truth, either in the moral or the scientific sense. ...” [Hermann Ilausehniiig, former president of the Danzig Senate; quoted from his </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Voice of Destruction,</span><span class="font9"> page 295; G. P. Putnam’s Sons, New York.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Before considering the advance of the Nazi-Catholic Fifth Column in Texas let the sober-minded pause and think just, what the overrunning of this country by the Nazi-Catholics means. We all know honest Catholics who are loyal Americans.

When it is said “count on” it means that no low crime, from betrayal of relatives to the murder of fellow citizens, will be hesitated at by the fanatical followers of the fuehrer. Secretly at the confessional, even as it was broadcast that the pope approved Hitler, the word will be passed on that II Papa is really betting on son Hitler despite any “necessary” misstatements made by those not competent to speak the will of the “infallible” pope. It will get around, tn a week the favor of the pope made Roosevelt president of the United States! Again a country will be ravaged by madmen fighting to restore the Holy Roman Empire against the American descendants of the Huguenots, the Puritans, the Presbyterians, the Wesleyans, who escaped the Roman Catholic Inquisition more than two hundred years ago and who established these once free United States of America. Rome is marching! Let no one be deceived by the wolf’s Nazi costume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mexican Border Barrage</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Texas is a state which once had grim memories of the aggressions of priests. So terrible were these experiences that their State Declaration of Independence names the priests as “the eternal enemies of the people”. Since then their vigil has relaxed and the infiltration of Rome’s hirelings, German, Mexican and Spanish, has been tremendous. New Braunfels, Texas, is a city of Nazis where aspersions against Hitler cause dangerous mutterings against the offender. If he has German rela-tivefi the horrible law of retaliation is used to torment them, according to a San Antonio press report. San Antonio itself is the city where “Father” Valenta, a Nazi priest, led several thousand parishioners against a Communist meeting at the beautiful municipal auditorium last summer. The Communists had permission to assemble from Mayor Maury Maverick, but, ignoring all law, the rioters hit policemen attempting to quell the mob and marched with Valenta at the head to the Alamo building. A little over a century ago this mob would have been blasted by the defenders of the Alamo. Today residents of San Antonio profess to believe it was merely a demonstr a- ■ tion by some Mexican boys.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Swastika displayed, in the copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font9"> which some of Jehovah’s witnesses carried was used as a club by the lawbreakers in efforts to destroy and discredit their work because it exposes the Nazis and the Hierarchy. In several towns priests were seen going to the city halls just before the mob gathered, and in another instance a priest was seen exhorting a group to action. The American Legion well knows that Jehovah’s witnesses are not Nazis. Their action was a malicious breach of the law which they have sworn to uphold, and instead of serving to stem Nazism and the Fifth Column it had the reverse effect. The real Nazis, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, priests and those under the control of priests, are shielded by the false accusation of others. Jehovah’s witnesses have constantly called attention to the advance of Nazism and its allies the Catholic authorities; consequently an attack on these witnesses acts as an aid to Nazism and strikes a blow at those who would expose Nazism. Again the Hierarchy is pushing forward her schemes behind the smoke-screen of vicious assaults on the Lord’s people, the only friends of the American commonwealth on earth today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego would not bow down to the image made by Nebuchadnezzar, but all were honored officials in Babylon. Mordecai would not bow down to Haman, the appointee of the Persian king, but he held a high position in the realm of Ahasuerus. Nehemiah was the king’s cupbearer under Artaxerxes and he was honored in the palace of Shushan. He was sad because Jerusalem, &quot;the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste,” and he was sent by the king to repair it. He was accused of sedition, but the king upheld him. So it is today that Jehovah’s witnesses do not salute the flag or any man-jnade thing but are loyal to the principles for which the flag stands. This cannot be said for Catholic priests, and many of their deluded parishioners, among which are members of the American Legion. Their salute of flag is calculated to hide treachery, and had its model in the salute Judas gave Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hypocrisy in a Patriotic Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the American Legion are many honorable men who are vitally concerned in preserving America and American institutions, one of whom is quoted below as condemning the above outrages. But the Legion organization has suffered an infiltration of enemies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 10, 1040 </span><span class="font9">haters of liberty like the Knights of Columbus, and is being used by the Hierarchy to achieve ends destructive to America. If the Hierarchy can camouflage its own Fifth Column activities by accusing those it desires to discredit'and use the American Legion to do it, the American people are the losers by having their attention diverted from the real criminals. The Hierarchy’s strategy is merely a modern use of an old trick of thieves of all ages: the thief </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">himself,</span><span class="font9"> to elude pursuers, halts and points ahead shouting, &quot;Stop thief,” Of these tactics the American public will doubtless be treated to wholesale </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When those who are thus victimized </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9">proved innocent most people will think that such false accusation is merely the mistake </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">overzealous patriots; they will not realize that behind the rending mobs the Hierarchy’s Fifth Column of Nazi action works unmolested and unsuspected, the mighty espionage system of priests, prelates and worshipers taking orders from Rome. There are countless millions of Catholics in North America </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font9">will obey implicitly the commands of pope and priest. It is to be expected that many honest American Catholics will refuse to betray their country to the Nazi terror. But what of the countless millions who do not read except what the priest tells them to read, to whom murder is considered sacred duty if ordered by the bishop, who will move in a solid obedient phalanx under the direction of the Nazi overlord? They will ask </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font9">questions, march like sheep to the slaughter, mowing down “heretics”, &quot;Communists” and all the enemies of their only sovereign, “the successor of St. Peter” (who, the Bible declares, has had no successor), and the blackened ruins of America will testify to the folly of religion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Will any thoughtful man repeat “It can’t happen here”? Let such remember that Rome has the most gigantic spy system in the world, with its myriads of priests, monsignors, monks, nuns, friars, lay organizations, key men in government, business and press, army and navy; who report to their superiors the bishops, archbishops, and cardinals; who in turn report to the absolute monarch of this autocracy, the ally of Hitler, Pope Pius XII. Here is a government having all the efficiency </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">an absolute dictatorship which it is, operating from Vatican City, the best-informed foreign office in the world, having sources of information denied to others: the secrets of the confessionals where soldiers, businessmen </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">officials confess all to the Nazi spy who sits in the confessional box. Can anyone doubt that the Hierarchy system is the Nazi Fifth Column fighting to bring all the world to the feet of Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Turning once more to the hypocritical action of the American Legion members in Texas, note the comment of an honest man among them. Major John N. Merrill, United States Army, retired, and now living in Brownsville, Texas, xvrotc the Brownsville </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font9"> a letter (reproduced in their May 22 issue) which is headed “Rktibkd L'. S. Abmy Officer Lashes Action Against 'Jehovah’s witnesses’,” and states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1 think it is time to say Whoa! back up; the report of the action of the American Legion in San Benito against the so-called Jehovah’s Witnesses is, to me, bigoted and hysterical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lest there be any misunderstanding, I come of a straight American family that has been in this country since 1635 and of a combined English, Scotch, Irish and some French stock; in other words, an American. During the World War I was overseas and wounded. I am a Legionnaire too. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This country was founded on religious tolerance. That Jehovah’s Witnesses are a Fifth Column is pure poppycock and bunk and witch-hunting. We need not agree with these people, but they surely have their right to think as they please. For shame that the American Legion should lose its head and take part in such methods. It reminds me of the remark credited to Hudson Maxim that the Puritans came to America to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">And prevent . everyone else from doing the same.</span><span class="font9"> The prince de Talleyrand once said: ‘I do not agree with you hut I will fight to the death to protect your right to say it.’ In other words, free speech. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These Jehovah’s Witnesses are not Guilty as charged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Let’s keep our heads; the government does not need such half-baked actidn as took place in San Benito. The roster of names of the World War American forces and of all American Lcigon Posts includes names from ail the countries of Europe, of all faiths, all creeds; many of them or their parents came to America,, our America, seeking refuge from just this sort of persecution. Again I say, </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">For shame!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Del Rio Disturbance Recalls Court Decision Upholding Right of Sects to Distribute Tracts</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Washington, May 24. (UP) The disturbance at Del Rio, Tex., assertedly involving three Jehovah’S Witnesses solicitors has recalled Monday’s U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that the right of pamphlet distribution by such religious sects is guaranteed by the constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a vigorous opinion by Justice Robert J. Owens [Error; should be Owen J. Roberts] the Court held that three members of the sect could not be convicted for breaching the peace in New Haven, Conn., even though they passed out violently anti-Catholic tracts to members of that faith and played before Catholics on the street records calling Catholicism a “racket” . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From now on we may expect to see more large-scale mob action. This action will be patterned largely after the Nazi Catholic pogroms of Germany, which had their origin in turn in the Roman Catholic Inquisition methods, copied also by the Coughlinites in the streets of New York. Mobs can be made to do acts of violence that sober men would shrink from. Let the honest Legionnaires and honest Catholics take note of this move; for an attack on Jehovah’s witnesses the Lord Jesus Christ, now King of the World, counts as an attack upon Himself.—Matthew 25 : 45, 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Brief</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In brief, this article has advanced evidence to prove: That Hitler is conducting a “holy war” to recoup the “Holy Roman Empire” for his master, the pope; that the vast treachery of the Nazi Fifth Column is made possible by its tremendous personnel of priests, prelates, and deluded followers; that millions of North American Catholics will volunteer or be drafted into Fifth Column activities; that the Hierarchy is taking and will continue to take advantage of the hysterical anxiety in America, to incite mobs against any organization that is exposing them, especially “Jehovah’s witnesses; that their actions will be smoke-screens to hide the enormous intrigue of Rome aiming to put all the world under Papal domination; and that Jehovah will exact the lives of those who fight His people. The Theocracy is here, and the great Theo-crat ; “Let all the earth keep silence before him.” In Nazi garb the Papal wolf is despoiling Europe, and her triumphs spread to America; but her destruction shall be permanent.—Psalms 9:17; 37 : 38 ; 145:20; Proverbs 11: 21; Revelation 17 :16.—Elton Groves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ What do you think of soldiers that indiscriminately rape all the women of the towns they conquer; that use the furniture of the poor people for firewood instead of coal offered to them, on the ground that it is dry and burns well; that stable their horses in the best rooms of the homes of the well-to-do; that feed their horses on grain intended to preserve human life, even when other food for them is provided; that turn their horses into wheat fields to graze, thereby destroying more grain than they consume; that use the open streets for the consummation of attacks Upon helpless women; that enter homes and machine-gun all the-inmates? And, finally, what do you think of the individual soldier who demanded and received a man’s quilt and paid for it by thrusting his bayonet through the giver’s body ? If this is civilization, do you blame the Chinese for resisting the process?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The Saiki Food Plan</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Everything in Japan that could be remotely described as food has been scheduled, in a list comprising more than 6,000 items. The Japanese government may at any moment put the Saiki plan, based on these schedules, into operation, with the result that all workers will be fed collectively in factories, schools, barracks, town and village halls, at a cost per day of less than twopence (4 cents) each. Some of the possible foods that have been studied are dogs, eats, rats, grasshoppers, snails, and frogs.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Japanese in Manchuria</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ After six years of occupation only 5 percent of the population of Manchuria are Japanese. Last year it was the announced intention of the Japanese government to settle 6,000 men with their families; but the records show that only 600 men without families left their homeland for Manchuria.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ The war in China is not a mere war: it is an extermination. No prisoners are taken: all are destroyed. No enemy wounded are cared for: all are left to die on the field of battle. And the Japanese make no provision for the existence of the noncombatants in areas taken over in the fighting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ While the murderers roared away into the east, we hurried to the stricken area near the East Gate. The bombs had fallen into the poorest quarter where the coolies were nearly all absent at work. The number of women and children killed and maimed was nearly a hundred. I counted several, bodiless heads ol babies. From piles of rubble came faint groans. A woman sat speechless beside the prostrate form of her dead husband, in her arms a baby missing from the waist down. The Japanese airplanes that did the killing were manufactured in the United States.—Edgar Ansel Mowrer, in his book The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon Wakes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Mr. William Young, 112 Rogart St., Glasgow</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman : What is your occupation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Young; T am one of Jehovah’s witnesses and am devoting my whole life to preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: How long have you been wholly engaged in this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Young: For about a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: &quot;What were you doing previously ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Young: On account of my sight I have never been able to take up a proper trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(Then R. Gough, Glasgow company servant, was called as a witness.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman : Are not all Christian bodies preaching the gospel of the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gougn: No. The gospel of the Kingdom is the truth concerning the setting up of the kingdom of God on the earth today, and this is not taught or believed by any so-called Christian church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: What do you mean by the kingdom of God being set up on earth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough: A righteous government established by Jehovah in the place of present governments. with Christ as King, operating through faithful men who in the past have proved their faithfulness to Jehovah's laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman : You mean a Theocracy in the strict sense?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough: Definitely. Where the law of God is the only law, when God’s will shall bo done on earth as in heaven, and when all present forms of government now violating that law' .will no longer exist.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: Do you mean that there is no righteous government on earth today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough; Not one. All governments are against Jehovah, because all are striving to maintain the present order of things, which the Bible declares is against God, and which order must be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman : Do you mean that there has never been a righteous government on the earth ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough: With the exception of the nation of Israel, there has never been a righteous government; and that was only a typical arrangement picturing how God’s kingdom-would operate when established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: You say that that was a righteous government, yet the-nation of Israel went to war and had God’s blessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr, Gough: True, because Jehovah was demonstrating through that typical arrangement thart all opposed to Him and His kingdom are His enemies and will be destroyed. The nation of Israel went to war at the express command of Jehovah to execute His judgments, and not for any political reasons or commercial gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: Would you not say that the present war is being fought for a righteous cause and has God’s approval?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough: No. Jehovah takes no part nor favors any side in a war between nations, but allows them to take their own course, and commands Christians to stand separate and take no part in any such wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: You will not fight, yet you take all the benefits ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gou£h: Whatever benefits we take we pay for by taxation. We are law-abiding citizens and only refuse to obey a law when that law conflicts with the expressed law of God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The. Chairman: Are -there any of you— Jehovah’s witn esses —in Germany?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough: Yes. Thousands of them, but most are in concentration camps because of their refusal to obey the laws of that government which are against the Jaws of Jehovah, whom we serve,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Chairman: Lft you all hold to the same teachings; I mean as a body?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mr. Gough: Absolutely. We were all conscientious objectors during the last war. We take no part whatever in the maintenance of the present form of government; we do not even vote. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.•</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>“A Little Gray Home in the West”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ When we arrived here the publishers were meeting in a dirty, shabby old broken-down church. After much effort we managed to find a broken-down old house in a wonderful location halfway between the twin cities of Centralia and Chehalis, which cities are but four miles apart. A publisher gave us lumber, which he took in place of money owed him by a mill, and we were off on a building program. I put on overalls to help my husband, and together we tore down the place and reconstructed the Kingdom Hall shown herewith. Here is now a clean, orderly and attractive meeting place, book room, sound equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 10, 1®40 </span><span class="font9">room, and a suitable headquarters in this vicinity for Jehovah’s Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In two months, with the help of the local publishers, the place was completed, inside and out. Fifteen ears go by every minute, as it is on the main highway to the north and south; and do the people stare? Sometimes we see them lean right out of the windows of the automobiles. If anyone had told me years ago that I would have had a share in building “an house for the Lord” I could not have believed it possible. We could never have done it in our own strength. The Lord must have wished it; for He helped in every way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now we have a nice little company with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">22 </span><span class="font9">publishers. In the attic we have two dear old pioneers. We live next to the hall, in our trailer. There are plenty of “Silver Shirts” here, clamoring for the Jews’ blood. At the present time nothing else will satisfy them, and they will not read. The town is crowded with churches. I doubt if you ever saw so many in proportion to the population. Yesterday and today the local broadcasting station put on the recordings “Instruction” and “Miracles” and we are interested as to what will be the reactions from the elergy.—B.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In Quebec</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ On March 24, 1939, about 7 p.m., four police officers (two being Provincial police and two city police) entered the headquarters of the pioneers located at Montreal, searched the premises and seized all the books, phonographs and records in the house. All suitcases and dresser drawers were searched, and among the literature seized were Bibles, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbooks, </span><span class="font9">and even the Campaign “Thermometer” chart. There were seven pioneers in the home at the time, two or three others being out making back-cabs, and the names of those present were taken by the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following afternoon two Provincial police again called, at the house, stating that they wanted to get a statement. Only two were in the house, and they would not give them any information. They stated that they would return in the evening to get the information they wanted; but on arriving they were disappointed, as only one person was there, and no information was given. Announcement was made over the radio that evening, on the “French Radio News” hour, that “police were combing Montreal for Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p><img src="g_E_19400710_files/g_E_19400710-6.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:117pt;">

<p><span class="font9">Ten days later the seven pioneers whose names the police had taken on March 24 werp summoned to appear in court the following day. They all appeared at the high constable's office and warrants were produced charging them with “being parties to a seditious conspiracy in uttering a seditious libel’<sup>1</sup>. They were taken before Judge Guerin for the arrangement of bail, and all were allowed to go on parole after giving their word to appear for preliminary enquiry on April 32. They ■were then taken to the Provincial Police headquarters, where they were photographed and' fingerprinted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">On</span><span class="font9"> April 12 the Crown asked for a postponement of the preliminary enquiry until-April 27 ; and on that date the hearing tc»k place. Judge Langlois was on the bench, and he is a Catholic, and bitter against Jehovah's witnesses. The enquiry was a record session for shortness. The one and only exhibit was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font9"> The brethren were sent up for trial at the next Assizes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After several postponements, they came up for trial on February 12, 1940, and the case moved with lightning speed, being completed in one day. In the absence of Mr, Justice Wilfrid Lazure Chief Justice Greenshields was on the bench. As two of the defendants are English, an English jury was allowed. An Anglican clergyman and a priest from the University of Montreal appeared as “expert” witnesses for the Crown. These testified that the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font9"> was capable of arousing animosity and creating discord and discontent among His Majesty’s subjects. In his address to the jury Chief Justice Greenshields, who showed his prejudice throughout the trial, made the statement that “the author of the book might have sung a different tune had he</span></p><img src="g_E_19400710_files/g_E_19400710-7.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:119pt;">

<p><span class="font9">met a good Anglican or a good Catholic who had a horsewhip handy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The jury were out but half an hour when they returned with a verdict of “Guilty”. Six of the witnesses were sentenced to two months in jail, and one sister, who had just been released from jail after serving fifteen days in the Sherbrooke jail for “sedition”, was given one month. In passing sentence Chief Justice Greenshields referred to the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font9"> as “an abomination” and stated that if the author of the book were before him he would have something further to say, and if any of the accused appeared before him again he would make the sentence much more severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The names of these witnesses are; Wilfred Spicer, Gerald Barry, Emery St. Amour, Florian Lessard, Paul Morel, Miss Blanche Dauphin, Miss Germaine Leger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On July, G, 1939, six pioneers (Felix Lacasse, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Brilotti, Blanche Dauphin, Germaine Morel and Marie Anne Morel) working near Sherbrooke,’P.Q., were arrested and brought into court on the charge of “seditious conspiracy”. The preliminary enquiry was held on July 19 and the publishers sent up for trial at the fall Assizes before the Court of King’s Bench, Sherbrooke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After several postponements, the trial began on January 15, 1940, Although all six were arrested at the same time and had pre-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">liminary enquiry together, yet when their trial began they were divided. Felix Lacasse and Blanche Dauphin were chosen to be tried first. In the selection of the jury- the defense counsel, R. L. Calder, K.C., moved for an English jury, or at least a mixed jury of English and French, inasmuch as the two accused understand English, although their native language is French, but this was ;denied and an all-Freneh jury was ehosen. Although the names of the English and French jurors were called alternately, the Crown prosecutor told every one of the English to “stand aside” and concentrated on the choice of an all-French jury. Mr. Calder took exception to this method of procedure and entered a formal protest in Court records, claiming that the prosecutor was depriving the accused of the right to a mixed jury, and the mere fact that a 'man spoke English did not prove he was incapable of acting on a jury. Before being sworn in each juror was questioned by defense counsel, a typical question being, “If you are a strong believer in the dogmas of the Roman Catholic Church do you think you will not be preju-dicated against someone who might attack those dogmas even though no violence or riots ever resulted from their teachings?” One prospective juror affirmed that “if the law were contrary to what my religion teaches I would decide against the law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two priests, an Anglican clergyman and a doctor of philosophy from the Montreal University were called as Crown witnesses. In cross-examination of these witnesses Mr. Calder drew Ilie admission that the books </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">do show </span><span class="font9">a difference between religion and Christianity. All passages referred to in the books, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font9"> were read in court in English and French. A. representative of the Society was called as a witness for the defense and in cross-examination was asked to explain the cartoons in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font9"> This gave a splendid opportunity of exposing the religious racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The judge, Mr. Justice Hector Ferret, was very fair throughout the trial, but the jury, true Roman Catholics, returned a verdict of “Guilty”. The accused were asked if they had anything to say, and they'took advantage of this opportunity to give a short testimony and were taken to the cells. When they were later brought into court for sentence it was reminiscent of the days of ancient Rome to see Felix Lacasse handcuffed to a police guard. Blanche Dauphin was apparently considered less dangerous, as her hands were free. They were sentenced to 15 days in jail; and two more were ehosen for trial, which proceeded immediately. The jury was again “hand-picked” for the ‘two Morel sisters, all English being rejected until they had twelve French Roman Catholics. This trial was completed in one day, the case going to the jury at 3: 30 p.m. They were out exactly six minutes when they returned with a verdict of “Guilty”, and these also were given fifteen days in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The trial of Mr. and Airs. Brilotti was postponed for one month. It took place on Febru-,arv 19, and at the opening of this trial defense counsel moved, for an all-English jury, the accused being Italian and understanding English better than French. The Crown prosecutor opposed this motion and optioned for a mixed panel, but an all-English panel was allowed. The Anglican clergyman was again present and swore that the books were likely to cause a breach of the peace and raise discontent, hatred and animosity. Defense counsel asked him lor an instance where this had been the case. The prosecutor objected to this question, but Judge ITector Verret allowed it. The cleric then said that “the literature might not cause an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">immediate</span><span class="font9"> uprising”, to which Mr. Calder replied that the literature had been in circulation for over fifty years and nothing had happened yet, so it is not. very likely to affect the present generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The jury on this case seemed interested and followed the arguments closely and the judge was just and fair throughout. Mr. Calder referred to the smallness oi' any religious organization that would resort to the courts to try to silence those whom they did not like; that only in Germany and Quebec was there any successful prosecution of Jehovah's witnesses. He scored the method that, had been followed, of dividing the case into three parts when all six accused had been arrested at the same time for .doing the same work, had their preliminary enquiry together and yet at triad— divided! Why? So they could get a conviction before a French Roman Catholic jury. If all six had been tried together a mixed jury could have been demanded, inasmuch as two of the accused -were not French. Why were the men called on the jury panel who were English asked to stand aside? Merely because they were English and liable to be of a different faith from what they wanted for their own purpose. “Such a procedure in. the Courts has never been heard of in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p><img src="g_E_19400710_files/g_E_19400710-9.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:75pt;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Loyal</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">f(T OYAL” is derived from the same root</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">I J</span><span class="font9"> word as &quot;law”, to wit. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">lex</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">leyalin </span><span class="font9">(Latin). “Loyalty” means faithful obedience to the law or rule of action prescribed by a superior power or by the supreme power. Is there a difference between a superior power and the supreme power? and if so. what is that difference, and which one must we obey? There is a difference. ''Superior power” means a power higher than the individual, such as the state or the nation. The “supreme power” is Jehovah God, who is the Creator and Lifegiver of all living creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is there a. sure and certain guide by which a person may properly determine which is a superior power and which is the supreme power? and if so, what is that guide? The Bible, which is the Word of God, is the truth. (See John 17:17.) The Bible is an absolute and perfect guide by which persons who want to do right may determine what is the right course. Addressing God, Psalm 1.19: 105 says: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus Christ, who is the Sun of Jehovah God and the Redeemer of man and the rightful King of the world, spoke with authority because He always uttered words of instruction given to Him by His father, Jehovah. A similar question was put to Jesus as to when one should obey a superior power and when the supreme power. His answer was: “Render therefore unto Ca-sar the things which be Caesars, and unto God the things which be God’s.” (Luke 2025) “Caesar” symbolically stands for the state or government of men, and it is the duty of one who is.in a covenant to' do God’s will and who is living within the borders of a nation or government to be obedient to the laws of that nation or state which are not. in conflict with the law of Jehovah God, the Supreme One. Where there is such conflict the one in the covenant witli God must be obedient to the supreme power, Jehovah God. As Jesus on that occasion said that a man should in obedience to the law of the land</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 10, 1940 </span><span class="font9">pay taxes, likewise a person should obey any and every law of the land or state which is not in conflict with God’s law. The law of God is supreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What, then, are the “things which be God’s”? Everything which God has commanded in His Word man should obey ; and if that man has agreed to do the will of God, then he jurist obey every law or commandment of Jehovah God. There is no alternative, if he w.ould remain true and faithful to Jehovah. Every honest person wants to do what is right, and all the laws of God are right and perfect. (Bsalm 19: 7, 8) Many laws made by men are very imperfect, because the men who make them are imperfect and often are moved by selfishness in making such laws, If one obeys the hrw of God he can never make a mistake. Wherever the authority or laws of two masters are in conflict no man can serve both masters. Jesus made this certain when lie said: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘No </span><span class="font9">man can serve two masters. He cannot serve God and mammon.’ (Matthew' 6:24) It follows that where there is a conflict between the law of the state, which is made by imperfect men, and the law of Jehovah God, the man who has covenanted to do God’s will must obey and will obey the law of God.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first duty of every man is to obey Jehovah God and not to place anything on an equality with or above God. Jesus was asked tills question : “What is the great commandment?” and Tie answered: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (Matthew 22:37) To all creatures in a covenant with Jehovah God is given this commandment: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth : thou shalt not bow dowm thyself to them, nor serve them. . . . Thou shalt not take the name of the T/oirl thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.” (Exodus 20: 3-7) To take the name of God in vain means that one has agreed to do God’s will and then fails or refuses to obey God, and therefore his agreement to do God’s will is a vain thing. Every person taking that course is certain to be destroyed, because God grants life everlasting only to those who do obey Him.—Acts 3 : 22, 23; John 17:3; Romans 1 : 31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “things which be God’s” are all things </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">which God's law requires His creatures to do. If the law of the state requires a person to do that which is contrary to the law of God, then the one who desires to live must obey the law of God, regardless of what consequences may result to him by reason of disobeying man’s law. The state may indict the most severe punishment upon one who refuses to obey the law of the state, even though in refusing to obey the law of the state he is obey</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font9">God’s law. For that reason the person must choose between man or the law of the state and God. The state can destroy your body. God can destroy your very texistenoe anywhere and everywhere. At Matthew 10 : 28 Jesus said: “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” It follow^, then, that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font9">state or nation can properly compel a person in eovenant relationship with God to disobey God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Could not such person outwardly obey the law of the land, even though that law is in violation of God’s law, and still be obedient to God’s law, merely having a mental reservation that he is on God’s side? No; such a thing would be impossible, for the reason that such an act would be hypocritical and God hates hypocrites. To outwardly obey the law of man merely to please men, and to do so with a mental reservation that one does not mean what he says but is in harmony with God, is gross dishonesty. We can deceive men, but we cannot deceive Jehovah God. He knows our every secret thought. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In some countries the people are compelled to hail the leader or ruler and to give him a certain salute? Is there anything in so doing that is eontraty io God’s law? Yes; such a course is in direct violation of God’s law as stated in Exodus 20:3-7 quoted above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Is </span><span class="font9">it right to compel people to salute a flag ? </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font9">anyone desires to salute a flag, that is his privilege, and no one has a right to say that he shall not salute it. But to compel persons in a covenant with God to salute a flag or any other image is wrong. For the Christian to salute a flag is in direct violation of God’s specific commandment. (Exodus 20:3-5) Would the refusal of a true Christian to salute a flag be disloyalty to the nation wherein he lives? No; not by any means. There are no people on earth that are as truly loyal as those who believe on God and Christ Jesus and who serve the Most High. Such persons obey the laws of the land because they want to do right, but the state or nation has no right to make a law compelling the covenant Christian to disobey God’s law. So far as the United States is concerned, the fundamental law of the land guarantees that no man shall be compelled to violate his conscience in things pertaining to the worship of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What master, then, must I obey? Each person must choose for himself what master he will serve, and obey. There are two masters. The one great Master is Jehovah God, and .the other one who has the mastery over </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font9">is the wicked one, Satan the Devil. To obey Satan means to be destroyed. To obey God means to gain life everlasting in happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a child has been taught by its parents to love and to obey Almighty God and Christ Jesus, as directed by the Bible, and the child believes that it is a violation of God’s law to salute any flag, is it right for school boards to expel such a child from school and thus deny the child the benefit of an education?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To force or attempt to force a child to salute a flag under such circumstances is to do exactly what the Lord says concerning those who disregard His law, which is supreme, to wit: “The throne of iniquity . . . frameth mischief by a law.” (Psalm 94:20) The child is trying to be righteous, and to force the child to violate its conscience is to do mischief and work injury to the child, and not only is such wrong, but it is a reproach upon the name of the Almighty God and a flagrant disobedience of His law, which is supreme. Those who do thus ‘frame mischief by law’, and who refuse a child the benefit of an education because it is loyal to the Almighty God, are workers of iniquity, and concerning such mischief framers the Lord God says: “They gather themselves' together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. And he [Jehovah God] shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their Own wickedness; yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off.”—Psalm 94: 21,23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To the covenant Christian the “Higher Powers” are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. (Romans 13:1) Every true follower of Christ Jesus not only will be willingly obedient but will be gladly obedient to every law of the land that is in harmony with God’s law; but to obey a law of man which is contrary to God’s law and thereby violate God’s specific law, the Christian in the covenant to do </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font9">will thus puts himself in certain jeopardy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Whither Politics?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font9">OLITICIANS take the spirit world seriously, regardless of whether you, kind reader, believe in spooks or not. There’s that material 1st ie-lo ok Ing dictator of Italy, for instance. According to the London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font9"> columnist, William Hickey, it is a fact that is well known in government and diplomatic circles in Ronuj that Mussolini now makes no big speech, takes Ho important step, without consulting a spirit medium; and he fears the dread “evil eye”, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">mat’occhio! </span><span class="font9">The pan-Germanic boss of Nazidom has through astrologers consulted the unseen forces that are interested in the politics of this crass world, and he regularly indulges in periods of secluded meditation, from which he emerges surcharged with a new vital force and mental power, the result of direct personal communion with the spirit world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In our own American life, as was widely reported in the dailies, when a prominent politician was running for the highest executive post in the land, his wife consulted a spirit medium for advance information as to how her consort would emerge from the political battle. Information to hand bears out that politicians all over the world are consulting soothsayers, or their spirit masters, demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Look at the political snarl of the entire world, including sanctimonious self-styled “Christendom”: honestly now, doesn’t politics seem utterly God-forsaken and gone to the Devil? Politicians themselves confess to the fact of this abandonment when they affectedly say: “What the world needs to save it from disaster is more religion.” Even the religionists make the same plain admission as to politics when, at a leading religious university in America, they organize a movement to “put God in government”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Suppose God Does Not Consent</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But suppose God does not consent to being put in politics; what then ? Who can disprove that the international and intranational statecraft muddle is due to the very fact that God refuses to be party to the political crookedness and bungling which have marked the game from the start, even in religious “Christendom”, the worst political mess of all? From no authority, secular or sacred, can anyone prove that Tie is the author of polities or that He organised it. It’s not His baby! No use</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 10, 1840</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">to sneak it onto His doorstep I In fact, through His personally sent mouthpiece, His own Son, He flatly disavowed all connection with it. To the leading hand-washing political figure in Jerusalem the Son of God was brought on the charge of meddling in the politics of the Roman Empire. His words then constitute </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">stern rebuff to all politicians currying divine favor, when He said; “My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.” (John 18: 36) Evidently one rebuff is not enough. Now the politicians come back for more! Why don’t they read their Bibles and spare themselves? At least the handsomely paid chaplains in the legislative chambers ought to! They pray for divine legislative guidance, at so much per </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">annum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nineteen centuries ago God had His candidate for Ruler all picked out and anointed, the long-promised King, above and separate from all earthly political machines and not dependent upon such for either His appointment or support. Why, then, should the Great Nominator and Appointer want to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">mix </span><span class="font9">in with local or national elections and other political campaigns? AU that mere humans could do or have done in the; way of setting up or overturning or revamping governments, whether monarchical, constitutional, republican, democratic, corporative, Fascist, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font9">Holy Roman, cannot change the Almighty’s own appointment of His Christ, or drag Him down from His strict neutrality or hands-off position into the sordid political shuffle of earthlings with their multiplicity of human ideas as to how to govern the whole earth or sections of it. Yet now the leading ecclesiastics of “Christendom” presumptuously set out to “put” HIM, against His consent am? without prior consultation of His written Word, into corrupt, bloodstained governmental gymnasties of men!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Same Scheme</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> IFas </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tried Long Ago</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why, it reminds us of the time when the author of religion himself tried to pull off the same thing. The attempt is described as taking place on an elevation from which the world could be surveyed. The founder of religiorf, using the wiliest political strategy, and glibly quoting sacred Scripture in the best religious</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">19 </span><span class="font9">style, was out to “put” the Son of God into government. The reporter, Luke, wrote up the story;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain j shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, AH this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan : for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”—Luke 4: 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If such a one as the Devil himself was unable to “put” even the Son of God into government, what could modern-day religionists hope to accomplish toward putting the Father himself into it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aha I but did you notice ? The Devil let slip there a word that explains just why men who claim to have a pull with God can never get Him to mix in with Republicans, Democrats, New Dealers, Nationalists, Fascists, or totalitarians, in the hope of reforming government manipulations—not even in the face of an artificial “Communist” scare, or to “make the world safe”, this time, not “for Democracy”, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font9">“for civilization and religion”. It’s a wonder they hadn’t noticed it before, that the old boy offered to give all the governments of this world and the glory of them, because, said he, “that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.” That accounts for it that the Son of God later called the Devil “the prinee of this world”; the apostolic writer, Paul, even ‘ called him “the god of this world”, who does a lot of blinding of minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Sinister. Unseen Prince</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since worldly government belongs to man’s worst enemy, the Devil, (and government at times makes all men feel that’s the truth,) the efforts of these ecclesiastical doctors of politics are at once seen doomed to complete failure. There can’t be successful and harmonious government with two bitter enemies of each other trying to operate it at the same time. The ecclesiastics might try to “put God in government”, but the question is, Would the Devil let Him get in? Those religious mixers of two unmixables should take the strong hint dropped by one of the twelve, James: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with (jod? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” (James. 4: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4) </span><span class="font9">“Touch not the unclean thing” is an ancient saying; the prophet Isaiah first used it regarding the totalitarian kingdom of Babylon, but hundreds of years later Paul saw good to quote it to the Christians at an important political center, Corinth.—Isaiah 52; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">11; 2 </span><span class="font9">Corinthians 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Though the sinister “prince of this world” could not drag the “Prince of Peace” into deal, it appears plain he did succeed in luring' the top-ranking religionists of “Christendom” into the political jigsaw puzzle of Europe, then of the Americas, and of the rest of the world. Did first the ecclesiastical element poke their pious nose into the matter of trying to govern the people because they felt that the Almighty was not taking due interest therein and the politicians were not making a good job of it and they must save the world from the barbarians? or was it that the rulers felt that politics was fast on its way to the Devil (although it was his already) and what was needed to save the State was a religious revival? Whatever true, authentic history has to show on this, there is no question that the men in sacerdotal vestments, the men of the cloth, are more and more making their voice to be heard in the high places of government. They are trying hard to play the role of spiritual advisers to the sorely perplexed and badly frustrated operators of the ships of State. Where did they get the appointment or commission to spiritually advise, telling rulers how to run the public affairs of this world? You’ll look in vain in the Bible! They are supposed to represent the “kingdom of heaven”, but heaven’s evidently too high for them to help run things up there, so they satisfy their ambition by helping run (if not dictating) things down here. Should not those claiming to represent the Most High fear to tread where that Almighty Potentate and also His Son disdain to tread? When ecclesiastics try to “put God in government”, all they succeed in doing is to put themselves in. That’s what they were out for in the first place, history shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deity</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> IF ns </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Never in It</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To any honest observer, the clear indication of such intermixing in secular matters and now of their latest excuse for further and deeper meddling, to wit, to “put God in government”, is this: that that Deity was never in it, but that the “god of this world” has owned and controlled it all the time, according to his own admission to the Son of God in the mount of temptation. Strange, too, that this</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">movement to put something new into statecraft should break out in the capital of the American nation, and has spread to no other nation, judging from world reports. Is this movement a slam at the present national administration? or at the American way of ruling ? Is God any less in government in America than He is, say, in Italy, or in Spain, or in any country where they have a union of ecclesiasticism and state? Why pick on America? The Devil’s claim of political ownership took in more than the American continent, according to his words to the Son of God. However that he, a union of ecclesiasticism and State cannot turn the trick. The Nazi fuehrer was cute enough to note that, in his recent vicious fling at the world’s greatest empire, where they have had just that sort of thing since before Henry the Eighth, Speaking at the Berlin Sportspalast, this January 30 last, Herr Hitler held up before British eyes a record of past British “sins” and declared that if Prime Minister Chamberlain now approached with a Bible he would look like the Devil approaching a poor soul with a prayer book. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, the professional politicians have lot the professional men of the cloth into their political councils, and pay them for prayers for blessings upon the public administration of affairs, but, with all that, the politicians now talk as if they were not sure they have gotten the backing, interest, guidance and support of,the Supreme Being himself. What with their appeals to the clergy, and this visiting of spooky mediums in touch with another world, for superhuman advice on how to stave off governmental calamity, forsooth, the rulers see their own insufficiency and correctly sense their God-forsaken state, and they present the same forlorn picture as that of a political ruler of an earlier day, Saul of Gibeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Typical Theocracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The Great Theoerat selected Saul’s nation, Israel, as His chosen people, and organized that small nation as a typical Theocracy, to make small-scale prophetic pictures or shadows of the coming real Theocracy, which shall successfully rule the whole earth in righteousness. Come to power, King Saul just about turned the nation into a political machine and persecuted the man whom he suspected of being what is called today a “political dark horse”. Saul violated all the rules of the typical theocracy, while keeping up his practice</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 10, 1940 f </span><span class="font9">of religion, “a form of godliness.” That being a typical theocracy, the Great Theoerat properly sent His representative, the prophet Samuel, to instruct the royal ruler. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font9">that’s no rule of procedure for ecclesiastics today, because not a political government now on earth is a theocracy, nor any part of the Theocracy long foretold, even though the politicians have ringed the clergy in. The Great Theoerat, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” duly rejected King Saul and forsook him. In time Saul was faced with disaster at the hands of Israel’s mortal enemies, the uncircumcised Philistines. Saul knew he was abandoned of Jehovah God. What then? </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Let </span><span class="font9">the inspired Record speak for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Saul Consulted Demons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a' familiar spirit at En-dor. And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath eut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die ? And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee ? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. . . . And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.”—1 Samuel 28; 5-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During life, and at the command of the Great Theoerat, the prophet Samuel had broken off relations with King Saul and had refused to see or speak with him. Now Samuel was dead, and must wait in the grave for the voice of the Son of God to call him forth in the resurrection at the due time. So that was a slick trick that the witch of Endor pulled</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21 </span><span class="font9">off on Saul. It was even a neater trick that the demons pulled off on the witch, deceiving her and also Saul into thinking that they had raised Samuel from the dead and had overruled God’s objections to Samuel’s speaking to Saul to give him some political advice. It’s odd how men alive on earth are unable to take away political worries, but when these same men are dead then the politicians that still live and have to shoulder the political problems think that they can get superior advice from these men now that they are dead, “dead as a doornail.” On the silliness of this process of reasoning let a prophet comment who lived through the reigns of four kings in a row:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their Godf on behalf of the living should they seek unto the dead? To the law and to the testimony [of God]! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.”—Isaiah 8:19, 20, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Present Rulers Consult Demons</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Present rulers of “Christendom” are in for no better break than the mentally distraught, misguided, God-forsaken King Saul got. The demon that appeared to the witch and palmed himself, off as the dead prophet Samuel gave Saul an incorrect forecast, of no comfort or value to Saul. No exhortation to repentance, back to God and the Bible! Naught, alas, but bitter disappointment, no good advice, only an unreliable prediction, as later events proved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cursed! yes, according to the very earliest records available, politics has been cursed with the dogging, inseparable, plaguy presence and interference of a malignant, invisible, super</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">human </span><span class="font9">directing power and influence. Saying it straight, government and demonism have' from the most primitive beginnings of politics been linked together. The rulers have ever appealed to and held communion with the demons for guidance in public affairs. Con</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sult </span><span class="font9">the earliest genuine records'of the kings of Babylon, the Pharaohs of the land of Ham, the monarchs of Assyria: all the political bosses of the people had their magi, their “wise men”, their astrologers, sorcerers,, diviners, fortune-tellers, or what their occult name, all mediums to tie human rulers in with the superior demon world. And the common people stood for it, were much impressed. It</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">22 .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">was 'Tike politician, like people”, even in , highly cultured, highly civilized Greece. It took a man who steered clear of politics to tell it to them: “And Paul, taking his stand in the midst of the Hill of Mars [in Athens], said: Ye men of Athens! in every way, how unusually reverent of the demons ye are I perceive.” (Acts 17: 22, Rotherham’s translation) Superstition is just a more agreeably ' sounding way of saying it, but the apostle called it “fear of demons”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today the politicians get no guidance out of the Bible, which they may quote </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font9">which they do not understand. Rather- they reject it and apply no instruction that is plainly stated in the Bible: it’s “too radical” for them. “To the law, and to the testimony”—not for them! And so they cry for “more religion”, and secretly and without the general ken of the public they go in the desperate way of King Saul and consult high-priced demon mediums of high repute. Just another form of religion. All religion is in the same class. The eminent English ecclesiastic, John Cardinal Newman, in his essay on “Development” of the doctrines of his religious organization, confessed that his, the chief religious organization of “Christendom”, took upon itself to “transmute the very instruments and appendages of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">demon-worship</span><span class="font9"> to an evangelical use” and that the religious practices of his church were and “arc all of pagan origin, and sanctified by their adoption into the Church”. So now’, when that same organization launches, in the nation’s capital, a movement to <sup>{t</sup>put God in government”, what can it mean but to put the “god of this world” into it (wasted effort, his satanic highness is already in it!), which is to say, to put the nation’s public servants still further under the power of the chief of demons and all his. associate detnons? Certainly this advice holds promise of no good. It is the same kind of adviee, and just as bad, as any that the demonized astrologers, necromancers, magicians, soothsayers, and spiritmediums gave to any Pharaoh, or to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">King </span><span class="font9">Ahab of Israel, or to any other inquiring monarchs of ancient history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Real Armageddon Impends</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Never owned by God Almighty, and never adopted by the Son of God, but claimed by the Devil and under the guidance of religion and of the prince of demons, whither politics? To another Kamo th-Gilead, as in King </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ahab’s case, With famished street dogs- thereafter to lick his blood from his war-chariot? Up answers an inspired man of God, who by the politicians of his day was exiled to the penal isle of Patmos. This exile looked down to our twentieth century, and, by pictures more strange than any cartoons of the Republican.Elephant, the Democratic Ass, the Russian Bear, the German double-Eagle, or the British Lion, John described events. After showing that the time had come for the Theocratic King and His Son, earth’s rightful King, to take over and rule as instead of the demons and the politicians, John draws this prophetic picture; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as it were frogs; for they are spirits of demons, working signs; which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them together unto the war of the great day of God, the Almighty. . . . And they gathered them together into the plaee which is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.” —The Revelation 16; 13-16, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Teddy Roosevelt had it wrong when he said in his political campaigning: “We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord.” Teddy was premature in his statement of having reached Armageddon. What’s more, as foretold by the Revelation to John, at Armageddon the politicians will not do “battle for the Lord”. The “spirits of demons” which do the gathering of the politicians will see to it on which .side these take their stand at that final showdown. And where the dictators and rulers take their stand and fight, there too religion takes its stand. In every war in “Christendom” religion has done so, and it is doing so in Europe today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Armageddon Really Means</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What, then, will Armageddon mean for politics and its pious handmaid, religion? To answer this pressing question nothing cpuld be better than a quotation from a world-known author, whose every where-circulated ’writings prove he has given more thought and study thereto and written more thereon than any other living writer;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font9"> means the place of battle, and therefore the name itself means the assembling of troops at the plaee of battle. The Scriptures designate it as “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, because the Almighty God will be completely victorious in that battle and he brings it about for his own purpose. It will definitely settle the riile of this world, and settle it right, It will eliminate the wicked from all the earth and enthrone righteousness; and that is good news to every honest person on earth, regardless of his religious faith. . . . The great deluge or flood that came upon the world in Noah’s day was an example of Armageddon, and foretold the results. In the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew the Lord Jesus dedares that as it was in Noah’s day, so shall it be at the end of the world, where we now are. The deluge destroyed the wicked, and only righteous Noah and his family were saved. That foretells the result of Armageddon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again I call your attention to the twenty-fifth chapter of Jeremiah’s prophecy, which is a description of what shall come upon the world at Armageddon. The words which I read are net the words of man, but the Lord’s Word, and there it is written; “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” (Jeremiah 25: 32, 33) So great will be the slaughter by the invisible forces of Jehovah God that there will not be enough people left on earth to bury those who are dead. That will be a tribulation such as the world has never known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Days of Horror Close at Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The prophet Habakkuk describes the battle of Armageddon, showing that the sun and the moon shall fail to give their light, that darkness will envelop the whole earth, and the only light to the world will be the flashing missiles of .fire and destruction flying through the air. Furthermore, the description discloses that the wild beasts of the forest and the zoos will be turned loose upon the people who have ill-treated the beasts for many centuries, and all these shall take part in the destruction of humankind. Floods and storms, hurricanes and fire, dashing to pieces and destroying cities, towns and nations, and the inhabitants thereof. These things I cite, not for the purpose of exciting anyone, nor to induce you to join something, but they are cited as a solemn warning of why God will bring this great calamity upon the world and what wifi be the result. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The real conflict is between those who are on Jehovah’s side and those who represent the Devil. What, then, shall the people do under these conditions? Shall they rise up in war or revolution? Shall they resort to carnal weapons? In the language of the Scriptures I answer, No, The part to be performed by Jehovah’s witnesses on earth is not to indulge in revolutions, wars or any other means of destruction. To them Jehovah says; ‘This is not your fight, but mine.’ </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font9"> Chronicles 20:15) The battle is the Lord's. Those who are witnesses for the Lord must sing his praises-as a testimony to his name and wait upon the Lord and mark the exhibition of his power for their salvation and deliverance. To all who love him Jehovah says: “Therefore wait ye upon me, saitli the Lord, until the day that J rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.”—Zephaniah 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These striking examples set forth in God’s Word are for the purpose of warning the people as to what they may expect in the very near future.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What a relief, the foretold result of Armageddon, to the politically oppressed people of good will! After the wiping out of polities and its allies comes The Theocracy with power unlimited over a cleansed earth. Then the people on earth will, with great joy to themselves, experience what happens when God Almighty gets into government.—Theo. Kratia.</span></p>

The casualties of the Japanese are estimated at 800,000, with about one-third of that number slain. The Japanese now control almost one-third the area of China and about one-half of its population.</span></p>

The Scriptures say that “the dead know not any thing”, but all the religionists say otherwise. Asaka should enter the ministry where he ean tell that lie every Sunday and get paid for it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ J. B. Priestley, noted English writer and liberal, declared before the war that the present Tory government of England was afflicted with a dreadful inertia. He said, “We see ourselves often in foreign eyes as a tired, rich old man, dozing over his money bags, but occasionally starting up in alarm. This is the England of a privileged governing class, the money-lending England of the ‘invisible exports’, an unereative and lethargic England. Among some of these people there may be a certain tenderness toward a Fascist order,” He added that Britain is highly undemocratic. In one section of the country the Tories polled a million and a half votes, the progressives a million; but the Tories had eighty-four members in the House of Commons from that section, and the Progressives but one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ In the London </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mirror</span><span class="font9"> the editorial writer Cassandra, takes Judge Richardson to task, because fhc judge, acting as chairman at a tribunal for conscientious objectors, made the. statement (subsequently withdrawn under pressure) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am certain, as sure as I sit here, that if Christ appeared today He would approve of this war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That did not just suit Cassandra, and after commenting on the probable slaughter of countless Berman men, women and children, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Listen, Judge Richardson! God isn’t on our side. God isn’t on Hitler’s side. Let’s keep Him out of this dirty, hideous, mechanized campaign of bloodshed. The whole thing sums up to the simple fact that we are out to save our necks by getting the other fellow first—and that’s all! Also, it’s less blasphemous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That is what is meant by “free speech”. It goes in Britain and it goes in America. It doesn’t go in Germany; it doesn’t go in Russia; it doesn’t go in Italy, and it doesn’t go in the papal center of all cussedness and deviltry on the earth. And furthermore, not only did Cassandra use free speech, but what he had to say was plain enough that anybody with a grain of sense knows just what he meant, and that it was'just the plain truth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>The Camera in Warfare</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It is supposed by some, and they give good reasons for their suppositions, that the destruction of the British battleship Royal Oak by submarine was brought about by the camera, in this: that German planes equipped with extraordinarily powerful camaras went back and forth over Scapa Flow at a height of 10,000 feet several days in succession and on those days made photographs which showed quite plainly the location of the mines that had been laid for the protection of the licet. All the German submarine commander had to do was to keep away from the mines and go in and out by a safe channel. He drowned 810 British sailors.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>Planned Scarcity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ Britain is now anxious to make every foot of tillable land yield its utmost. Yet it is only a little while since potato growers had to pay a penalty of £5 for every'’ acre planted to potatoes above that authorized by the so-called “Potato Board”. Prices were low, but hungry working people unable to buy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">' &nbsp;&nbsp;♦ One day recently a British merchant visit</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ing New York friends wept about the great taxation in England because of the war . . . “It’s a most gloomy picture,” he reported, “nobody has ambition to make money. We have to give back 95 percent of it to the government&quot; . . . “That’s too bad,” said one of his listeners, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font9"> feel very sorry for you. Your predicament would have broken the hearts of the boys who went down with The Royal Oak.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">—Exchange.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">♦ The big explosion at Waltham Abbey, 12 miles north of London, was so powerful that it was heard at Leamington Spa, 90 miles away, and doors were ripped from their hinges 9 miles away. Big steel girders were torn loose and thrown more than a quarter of a mile. This explosion of nitroglycerin was probably of sabotage origin and cost five men their lives.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Britain Has an Honest Man</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">♦ It will be good news the world round that an honest man has shown up, this time in Britain. At Amersham, Michael Mannion, age 61, was tramping, looking for work. On the pavement he found two £1 notes. He handed them to the police, and they handed them to the owner, a working woman, the mother of eight children. The result was that Michael received an invitation out to supper, then the police found him a job, and when the story got into the papers he began to get money. It all sounds as if it could have happened in some other and better world. It makes one think of the prophetic words in the 85th Psalm: “Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. Righteousness . . . shall set us in the way of his steps.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">♦ The heavy snows in Britain in January, 1940, were without precedent, and, as the country has no reason to expect sUch snows, it has no conveniences for handling them as they are handled in America. The result in Britain was that sortie trains were snowed in for nearly or quite 24 hours at a time, and Scotland was completely cut off from England until the trains could be shoveled out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ft » the privilege of every penon within these . shore* to enjoy the liberty of an open Bible. For centuries this indefeasible right has been the treasured heritage of every Briton. It can be said of Britain ns of no other country that in its homes the Bible has been cherished and revered as the foundation of liberty. Wherever the Bible has been freely circulated and read, the torch of liberty has burned, and conversely, where it ha* been kept from the people or has been ignored: ignorance.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">intolerance and oppression have ruled.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By multitudes religion is rector ised today in its true light as a racket of the first magnitude. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy extracts money </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the people and holds them.in subjection under a totalitarian rule of fear. Religion is founded on the traditions of men. It is in direct opposition </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christianity which is based on the eternal laws and commandments of Cod and the teachings of Jesus Christ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">recorded in God’s Word the Bible. For the past fifteen hundred' years Rome has led the world in religious hypocrisy. History abundantly records her wars of conquest, and her debauchery. The dark ages and the Inquisition can never be forgotten. The words of the prophet are true of Rome, “ also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.”— </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer 2<sub>;</sub> </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROME LEADS RELIGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Today the Roman Catholic Hier-‘ archy, under the cover of religion is ’pursuing her age-old tactics of intrigue and violence in every part of the earth. But she has nearly run </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">course. The day of her doom is at band.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Scales fell from the eyes of alert Britons and Americans when they ob-,*erved the pope saluting Hitler on his advent to power; his blessing the Abyssinian conflict; his labelling Franco the Butcher of Spain as ‘ a true son of the Chureh.' Rome has always been a master at world diplomacy, in the interests of the Chureh playing nation against nation regardless of whether they are Catholic or not. By craft she bus now manoeuvred herself into the key position causing .all nations to look to her for a peace. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">peace at her terms would l» the subjection of all free peoples including .America rad. Britain. The traditional freedom of Britain and America must be destroyed that she may triumph again as the mistress of iniquity as in the days before the Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROTESTANTS FOLLOW ROME</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">For many years, the trend of the free and established churches has been toward a reunion with Rome. Leading clergymen have openly declared themselves as desiring such reunion. These clergymen display their policy to strengthen religion, but this will again lead the people of this liberty-loving nation into bondage under the domination of Rome with its Jesuit agents. Such clergymen are not ehampions of freedom but openly advocate a snare which would bring the 'people only degradation and ignominy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Can such men forget the price paid by our forefathers for our freedom from Rome? Have they forgotten the , 19th article of faith of the Church of England which says, “the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their Living and manner of ceremonies, but also in matters of faith.’<sup>1</sup> Aho article 22</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> “The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardons, worshipping and adoration, as well of images as of reliques, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but. rather repugnant to the Word of God?’ Also article 28, “ Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of bread and wine) in the Supper of,the Lord cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.” Also article 37 : &quot;Tine Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this realm ol England/<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ADMISSION OF ROME’S AIMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As late as September 15th, 1939, the London Oaitotic </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sensid</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> revealed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it hates the liberty of the British Constitution. In an editorial it said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is evident that there is a growing trend of thought in Europe which would base our civilisation upon a. tradition that is Catholic in sympathy and in conscious or unconscious opposition to the liberalism derived from the French Revolution and British World influence J’ Judge for yourselves whether Rome favours the.continuance of our traditional liberty, and whether the leaders of the so-called Protestants are not now gradually leading their flocks to the “ Mother Chureh” of Rome,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUE CHRISTIANS FORSAKE RELIGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many sincere and honest people today , re-examining their Bibles in the light of world events, are distressed at the world-troubled condition and the attitude of religion thereto. Such sincere persons still enjoying the liberty of studying with their Bible open before them, c</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">anno</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">t, fail to we that the practices and abominations now committed by religion in the name of God and Christ are incompatible with true Christianity. Jehovah witnesses, known also as the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, are a body of true Christians who during the past fifty years in Britain and throughout the entire earth have forsaken hypocritical religion and have been letting their light shine by openly declaring to the peoples that the day of the doom of religion has come,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CATHOLIC PRESS ATTACKS JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, watching the bold and uncompromifr- ' ing stand of Jehovah’s witnesses for the truth of the Scriptures, have used their common weapons of slander and secret intrigue to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">atop the witness. la recent years they have resorted to s world-wide canipaign of violence and abuse against these servants of ths Most High God. In Britain alone last year 66 cases of violent assault j 3 mob riots and ten attempts to break up their Bible meetings were made by Catholic Action groups in various parts of the country. They do not come forth honestly and openly to argue the truth that honest persons might be properly informed; rather they resort to fascist methods of force and violence to put a gag on the pro-el aimers of truth, Month after month last year the Catholic Press (CoffcoHc </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herald, Universe</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Cuikoiw Times) carried dn a vicious libellous attack on Jehovah’s witnesses and on Judge Rutherford, the president of the Watchtower Society* They have made lies their refuge; (See Isaiah 28: 14-22 as to their fate). Such articles in the Catholic Press have encouraged members of the Catholic population to use Hitler methods towards Jehovah’s witnesses in their locality. Such moi’ dents are an advance signal of the Hierarchy's determination to destroy from this lend the free and open stand for the Bible and its teaching of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JUDGE RUTHERFORD LIBELLED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In their press attacks Judge Rutherford has been repeatedly Spoken of as an ex-convict. Judge Rutherford is an American lawyer and &amp;&nbsp;champion of God's law the Bible and an upholder of the teachings of Christ. On July 4, 1918, as a result of a conspiracy. Judge Rutherford was falsely accused and, having been refused bail by Federal Judge Manton, a Roman Catholic, a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Knight of St, Gregory the Great/ ’ was hurried away to the Federal prison. Nine months later the case finally came before the Supreme Court of the United States and he-was admitted to hail. Shortly thereafter the ease, which contained 125 errore, was jried and the majority *of the Appellate Court readily reversed the adverse judgment while the ** Knight of St Gregory the Great ” (Manton) under the influence of his co-eonspirators, the Catholic Hierarchy, dissented in that opinion. Thus Judge Rutherford’s good name and reputation were exonerated and the charge of being an ex-convict is a defamation and a gross Hbel on him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Twenty-one years afterwards on June 3, 1939, this Judge (Manton) wks deposed from office for selling Judicial decisions for monetary con-aider&amp;tion. It was proved against this Roman Catholic Judge, a &quot;&nbsp;Knight of St. Gregory the Great/ ’ that his criminal acts in polluting the courts of justice covered a long period. Did the Boman Cathode papers report this, exposure of Manton! They did not. These his partners in Catholic Artion have nothing to say about this triumph of justice,</span></p>

Jehovah's witnesses contested this legislative action all the way to the highest court in the land, the United States Supreme Court. On Oct. 13, 1939, Judge Rutherford appeared before the Supreme Court as chief counsel for the defence. The historic dignity of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">th™</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Supreme Court precludes the possibility of an inexperienced or dishonoured lawyer from being allowed as a legal adviser to appear before it nor would an ex-convict be allowed to plead before it, Note the following from Judge Rutherford's argument in the court championing the course of freedom against the Hierarchy's legal attempt at gagging freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">” May it plca&amp;e the court . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This is not a religious question. The undisputed evidence that appears in the record i« that the petitioner was at the time she was arrested “an ordained minister of Jehovah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">preach the gospel of God’s kingdom under ChrUt ” and that she was engaged in this work for that eric purpose It would be wholly inconsistent to require s minister </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of.the</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> gospel to apply to a human ^fHcLat for a permit to do that which the Almighty commands must he done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>11</sup> Let us assume that the Nazis. Fascists, and Soviets were moving in secret to invade the American shorn and some good citizen learning this fact went from house to house tn notify the people of the impending danger and in doing so he printed folders containing such warning which he distributed from house to house without first obtaining a permit from the police. According to the New Jersey courts he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ia guilty of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> a mis-demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">~ <sup>41</sup> Only the corporate or -totalitarian states attempt to regulate the conscience of men or attempt to compel them to obey man’s law which is la derogation of the law of Almighty God .... and certainly ia not within the power of the state or the courts to compel a person to violate his conscience or violate the supreme law as a condition, precedent to raising the quesdah of the validity of an ordinance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Supreme Court gave their decision in favour of Jehovah’s witnesses The Court recognized the methods of the Inquisition, as is clearly shown by their language in the opinion written by Justice Roberts. They saw that it was simply a modern version of the methods of the Inquisition when fiends, such as the Roman</span></p>

In its splendid judgment the Supreme Court stated, amongst other things in its opinion the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; On this method of ccmmunicaiicn the ordinance imposts censorship, abuse of which engendered the struggle in England which eventuated tn the establishment of the. doctrine the freedom of the press embodied in our Constitution. To require a censorship through license which makes impos&amp;ibte the free and unhampered distribution of pamphlets strikes at the very heart or the constitutional guarantee.’&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus the United States Supreme Court ■ clearly defended the common liberty* of the British and American people* and frustrated the Hierarchy's efforts to throttle freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANISM OR FREEDOM ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Evidence is abundant of the steady penetration of Romanism into the English speaking world during recent years. The Hierarchy has become a political power in Australia and New Zealand; wealds much influence in South Africa and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Colonies; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has a.stronghold in Quebec. It has made great strides in America through its agents such us Father Coughlin □£ the recently formed “ Christian Front.&quot; In Britain the Hierarchy's friendliness to ttys British Union of .Fascists is common knowledge as ia also their' continual agitation in the ' Irish problem. It seems the time has come to plainly inform the Fascist-Catholic Hierarchy that this is the land of Britain which repudiates the encroachment of this foreign Roman power; that while its subjects </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">freely practice their religion here without hindrance, they may not use their religious institution as a political machine to limit the traditional </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">free</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dom of the British people. Let the so-called Protestant leaders who are now looking to Rome for guidance be warned that there are yet many Christians in Britain who. hating religion, are determined not to compromise nor sacrifice their heritage of the open Bible and freedom of worshipping Almighty God according to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dictates of their confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">STAND FOR CHRISTIANITY AND FREEDOM' 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let all honest Catholies and honest Protestants now forsake religion and have no part in the growing, movement of organized religious hypocrisy under the leadership of Rome.’ Take your stand for the open Bible and Christianity as taught therein. By such a course freedom is assured. Jesus Christ the founder of Christianity said: “ The truth shall make </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">free.” (John 8: 32).</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>A Report from Central Europe</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font9"> REPORT from Central Europe sent just • before the outbreak of the new war gives a touching picture of the faithfulness of Jehovah’s witnesses, where one country after another is being swallowed up by the Monstrosity. There were even then tight restrictions on the work in Poland, with arrest of'all witnesses in Danzig. All foreign pioneers had had to leave Yugoslavia, and even in the Netherlands they were permitted only to make back-calls, yet as compared with the previous year only a few less books were placed, and the number of booklets remained the same, for the four months’ period involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Polaftd the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was exceedingly active, while in Rumania the witness work seemed completely suppressed. In Belgium police actions against publishers were more numerous than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The death of witness Setz, of Innsbruck, is reported as having taken place in the Dachau concentration camp; no doubt he was done to death. The intolerant activity of Catholic Action makes itself felt in all parts of Switzerland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A witness in Germany lost his life while in the hands of the enemy; the cause of his death was given as “apoplexy of the heart”. His wife wrote that he was dead, but she did not get anything in writing. For sending out this letter a stamp was affixed to it reading, “This woman under preventive arrest is as stubborn a Bible Student now as ever, refusing to renounce the false doctrines of the Bible Students. For this reason she has' been deprived of the allowance of correspondence as permitted for others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Witness Dietsehi was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, but in all his sufferings remained steadfast and strong in the Lord, looking forward to the great act of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Witness </span><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:line-through;">X......</span><span class="font9"> when arrested had on his</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">person letters reporting ill-treatment of witnesses of Jehovah which the judge qn the bench stated were so plain and unvarnished that their truthfulness could not be questioned. X----himself was sentenced to three</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and a half years in prison and was told that when the time of his imprisonment is over he will be handed over to the dreaded Berlin Gestapo, which takes the prize for cruelty when it conies to forcing “confessions” f^om their victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">X----</span><span class="font9">has already suffered terrible things</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">at’the hands of the Gestapo. One night he was thrice beaten into unconsciousness, and then cold water was poured over him to revive him so that he could be beaten again. He thinks the Gestapo mixed drugs with his food to break his. will power and weaken his control over his thoughts, because the Gestapo after one series of questionings read to him information which they said he had given to them, but which he does not remember having done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After his terrible treatment by the Gestapo </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">X----</span><span class="font9">could neither stand nor sit down. After</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">several days, when he saw his face in a glass, he did not recognize himself. When a woman confronted him in court she was terrified at his miserable appearance and said, “I have never seen this man before and am only frightened at his dreadful appearance.” His wife and mother have been in a concentration camp </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font9">one and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even in Germany there are still some of the other sheep of the Lord, hearing His voice and seeking refuge in the Lord’s organization in spite of all conditions. In one instance 12 were immersed, in January, 1939; and in another, 23, in March. The witnesses in Germany participate joyfully in the Lord’s work, in spite of all their afflictions, and stand fast in their faith in an impending and complete vindication of Jehovah’s name and the victory of righteousness. They now do their best in distributing the booklets </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font9"> knowing that there are other faithful ones on the Lord’s side, fighting with them shoulder to shoulder.

<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>Smoking foi* Smartness’ Sake</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font9">ERHAPS some of your young readers will benefit from, my experience as a “veteran” smoker of cigarettes for more than three years. I am ,a young girl of sixteen and I started smoking when I was a little over thirteen. Perhaps in my story you’ll find a moral somewhere. Most young people, I believe, start smoking only because they think it will increase their popularity. Particularly I think this is so where they lire naturally timid and want to do something that will prove that they’re good sports. It is a rather expensive way of proving it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As I see it, the most important angle, of it is not the question of whether it is morally wrong or right, but rather the question of its effect on physical health. Most.young smokers disregard that angle of.it entirely, but it is the most important. When I started smoking I thought that it was the smart thing to do and would make me one of the “gang”. It did, but it wasn’t worth it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In about a year I was inhaling, and doing the thing out of all proportion; sometimes smoking over a package a day. What has happened and what has proved to me that smoking is not, never was and never will be worth it is the fact that my life has practically been ruined by the smoking I did, all for the sake of popularity. I wish that all young persons who have started smoking, or are thinking about it, would take it from me that their physical health may be .in danger,‘It has just about ruined mine. For the last six months I’ve had a chronic case of nicotine poisoning which has made my life almost miserable, and at my age it should never have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If fhese young people who feel they must smoke, because it is “smart”, would consider the facts, or look at it from the physical health ‘ angle, I feel sure that would be enough to convince them of the futility and harm in smoking. I know this frdm my own experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Take it from me that any amount of popularity is not worth nicotine poisoning and the positive hell that it is.—“Young Smoker,” in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Health Culture.</span></p>
