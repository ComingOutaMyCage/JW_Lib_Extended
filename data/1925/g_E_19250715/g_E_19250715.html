<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Protecting the Skunks</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">V</span><span class="font5">ERY forcefully the Knoxville </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Plain Dealer </span><span class="font5">says: “Do you know that most states have laws for the protection of fish, calves, lambs, colts, deer, rabbits, quail, ducks, mud hens, musk rats, skunks and buzzards; and that all these laws are constitutional<sup>1</sup>? The only law for the protection of animals that w<sup>T</sup>as ever declared unconsitutional is the child labor law. Oh, baby dear, don’t you wish you were a cute little skunk ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another writer bitterly calls attention to the horrors of human sacrifice as practised in parts of India. He well says that we enlightened Westerners would not be willing to let our children be sacrificed to any false god, but only to the almighty dollar. Profits are not false gods in the eyes of many so-called Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still another writer points out that the Government can and does seize and destroy live stock to prevent the spread of disease; but when the stunting of its future citizens is at stake it suddenly finds itself helpless. If there is anything more strictly national than a citizen of the United States, will somebody point out what it is?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The history of national child labor legislation in the United States is very sad. In September, 1916, Congress passed a bill prohibiting interstate commerce in the products of child labor. Twenty-one months later the Supreme Court declared the bill unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In February, 1919, Congress passed a bill imposing a tax of ten percent on the products of child labor. After the lapse of thirty-nine months the Supreme Court ruled that this act also is unconstitutional. It then became evident that the Constitution would have to be amended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">year ago Congress adopted an amendment calling for national power to limit, regulate and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font5">of age; but powerful propaganda began </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">immediately make its appearance against the amendment. The very forces that had previously sought to have the acts of Congress voided now sought to prevent the adoption of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font5">mendment.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Who Was Back of the Propaganda?</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250715_files/g_E_19250715-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">EFORE an amendment can be made to the Constitution three-fourths of the states must signify their assent. As soon as the state legislatures began to consider the subject, the Farmers’ State Rights League, Inc., of Troy, N. C., began to flood the papers with half-page advertisements denouncing the amendment. An investigation disclosed that the Farmers’ States Rights League, Inc., is in reality a league of southern cotton-mill owners masquerading under a deceptive name. But the scheme worked, and the amendment was defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Catholic State of Massachusetts Cardinal O’Connell vehemently denounced the amendment; and by his order his denunciation was read before the altar in every Catholic church in Massachusetts at three services on each of three consecutive Sundays before the vote. The Roman Catholic church does not want any official inspection of the laundry system run under the name of Houses of the Good Shepherd, where the conditions are well known to be virtual penal servitude and slavery, twelve to fourteen hours per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Big business got on the job, too, declaring the proposed amendment to the constitution to be Bolshevism, Socialism. The press was used to scare farmers into thinking that, if Congress had its way, neither boys nor girls would be allowed to work in their own homes or on their fathers’ farms. Of course these statements were all lies, but the scheme worked, and the amendment was defeated. The skunks are protected; the children are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the everlasting credit of President Coolidge be it said that he was not on the skunk</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Side of this question. By speeches in public on three different occasions he stated his endorsement of the amendment. He knew, what all may know if they will, that child labor does not mean selling newspapers after school nor working a few hours on holidays, but an unremitting grind, day after day, without school, with- ■■ out play, with mind and body stunted, and morals too, while the men and women that should do the work cannot get it, because the wages are not enough to support them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">INCE the Supreme Court in 1922 declared the last child labor law unconstitutional the thirst for profits has led to a great increase in the number of little folks that are compelled to slave throughout the day at tasks set for them by their greedy or needy parents or .caretakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in “Colliers” reporting on an investigation which he made in the year 1923 said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Among the families investigated in this effort were found a great many eases of pneumonia and influenza,, mumps, typhoid fever, measles, whooping cough, bronchitis, tonsilitis, diptheria, eczema, coughs, tuberculosis and syphilis, all of which had been declared communicable and dangerous to public health by the State Health Board. . . .We know that these children made spectators at court weep when they were brought in to testify. . ., . There is one family, for instance, the children of which were told not to come to school until they were cleaned up of filth and vermin and disease. They did not go back. They stayed at home to work on milk tags and clothing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A reporter in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'American</span><span class="font5"> testified on January 11, 1924: “In one crowded tenement room I found a baby, not more than eighteen or nineteen months old, sitting on its grandmother’s lap, and stringing tags.” The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> in. December of the same year unconsciously pictures the great financiers of New York as approving matters of this kind when it says: “By an overwhelming vote the Chamber of Commerce bf the State of New York, at its monthly meeting yesterday, went on record as opposing the child labor amendment to the Constitution of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Perhaps we do not get the right slant on this; but as we see it, the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York is deadly opposed to taking away from any eighteen-months-old infant its constitutional right to work say</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BnooKLYN, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">twelve hours a day seven days in a week. Later the child might learn to play golf , if it survived; and golf would be unconstitutional for such children. Lets stick to the Constitution, no matter what happens to the kids! But golf is constitutional for members of the Chamber ofi Commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conditions in Philadelphia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250715_files/g_E_19250715-4.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">HILADELPHIA is particular about keeping the children in school. An investigation carried on by the Child Labor Association of Pennsylvania and the school authorities, in the spring of 1923, brought to light 217 children in two public schools in that city who do sweatshop work at home from seven to eight-thirty in the morning, at noon, and from four to ten at night, many of them getting in a full eighthour day besides going to school. On Saturdays and Sundays they work twelve to fourteen hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have not heard of the official attitude of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce on these conditions; but we presume the theory is that by working the kids eight hours a day when not in school they are kept out of mischief and away from the golf fields; and by letting them go to school they become patriotic so that they will want these conditions continued indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Incidently, the child workers frequently go to sleep in school, which is nature’s way of trying to make up for man’s inhumanity to man without violating the Constitution. Also, many of the little girls who work at night, stringing beads for the gowns worn by ladies whose husbands play golf, have permanently injured their eyesight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the items which come from Philadelphia, Providence, and other industrial centers are that little girls under eight embroider night dresses at twelve cents per dozen, with a deduction of two cents for loss. For putting hooks and eyes on rods they receive thirty cents for each 100 rods. For June roses they get twenty cents a gross. In Rhode Island they do 100 different kinds of work, all Constitutional.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>In California and Michigan</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250715_files/g_E_19250715-5.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:18pt;">

<p><span class="font5">SURVEY made by the state boards of health and education of California, one of the richest states of the Union, reveals the fact that there are 15,000 children under work-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing age who leave school early in the Spring and work until late Fall, gathering fruits and other crops in that state. These little folks, some of them mere babies, follow their parents all over the state, winding up the season in the hot “sunkist” cotton fields of Imperial Valley. Last November in Imperial Valley a score of cotton growers were arrested for employing child labor, some of the tots only six years of age. California is strong for the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It ■ is now nearly two years since the beet sugar exposures; but conditions are as bad as ever. At that time it was disclosed that the cultivation of sugar beets lends itself peculiarly to the exploitation of child labor. The little folks are in the fields at six in the morning, and work until as late as eight at night, with the shortest possible resting time in between. Up and down the rows they crawl, weeding and thinning out the plants, their wrists swollen and lame, their hands and knees sore and cracked, their necks sore and stiff. In harvest time the constant stooping to pull the five-pound to twenty-pound beets out of the ground is almost back-breaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The beet sugar workers occupy only the roughest kind of temporary shelters; such as abandoned farm houses, tar-papered shacks, portable cottages, tents and caravan wagons. Overcrowding to the limit is the rule. All the family works. A mother beet-worker testified that her baby had worked ever since he could lift a beet. This is Constitutional, exceedingly so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Schools in the beet districts have a custom of granting ‘beet vacation’ in the Fall, to augment the supply of available child labor. Senator Reed Smoot is said to have declared that the use of child labor in the beet fields of Colorado is a Godsend to the children, as it gives them something to do instead of running the streets.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>In Other States</span></h6>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">11IBTEEN states have laws which are on a par with the child labor laws, which were declared unconstitutional. Twenty-three states alloAV children under fourteen years of age to work. Thirty-seven states allow children to go to work without a common school education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One out of twelve American children, and in some states one out of four, is a child laborer. Mississippi sanctions work for boys of twelve. ■Georgia’s law permits girls of fourteen to work all night. In North Carolina the hours of labor of convicts in the state prisons are limited to nine, but boys and girls may and do work in the mills for ten and eleven hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A report from Texas, in 1923, told of a five-year-old who picked a bale of cotton during the season, and of another five-year-old who picked seventy-two pounds of cotton between sunrise and sunset on October 27th, and had very ‘sorry’ cotton to pick in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the worst of all places for child workers is in the canning factories, where the canning of many articles of food injures the hands. In the shrimp canning business the little workers cannot work steadily longer than a week at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">time. Their hands become raw, and they have to wait and give them a chance to heal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To a gentleman who glanced into a shrimp canning factory the boss said: “Them kids ain’t old enough to work, and they think you’re an inspector. I taught them to run away when anybody that was strange came into the factory. But we haven’t got anything to be afraid of, though; because the Government hasn’t </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font5">more authority to make kids stop working. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I’m </span><span class="font5">glad they knocked out those federal child labor laws. They sure caused us canners a heap of bother while they were in force.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among international workers in the cause of child labor, the United States is classed with Oriental countries. This may not be very gratifying to American pride; but it must suit those New York Chamber of Commerce defenders of the Constitution or they would not fight so hard against the poor kids.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">NDER the Mexican Constitution the maximum day’s work for children between twelve and sixteen years of age is six hours. The Government is opening both night and day schools for the development of child workers formerly driven to prolonged labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">G reat Britain passed the first child labor law -in 1802. It forbade the employment of children in the woolen and cotton mills more than twelve hours a day. Prior to that it was not an uncommon practice for parents to sell their offspring as apprentices; and in the early years of the nineteenth century gangs of helpless little ones from six or seven years and upwards, were auc-tinned off, thousands at a time, to great factories where their lives were a ghastly slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They received no wages; they were clothed in rags; their food was insufficient and of the coarsest kind; often they had to eat while standing at their work; they were driven to work twelve to sixteen hours; they had no holidays; their few hours for sleep were spent in filthy beds from which some other relay of little workers had just been roused; they had no schooling and no recreation, and lived amid the most shocking and brutal immorality. When one batch of such labor was used up, another was always ready. For these data we are indebted to the “Standard Reference Encyclopedia”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even as late as the World War the condition of labor in the British Isles was so inferior that it was difficult to recruit fair-sized men for the army. Some years ago the children used as chimney sweeps were deliberately starved in order that they might be small enough to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go </span><span class="font5">up and down the narrow flues. All that has been stopped. Labor conditions in China are now about as they were in England a hundred and twenty-five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In France the age limit is thirteen years as against fourteen in England. The time limit is ten hours, eight underground. Females may not work underground. Children may not labor between 9 p. m. and 5 a. m,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Belgium the age limit is twelve years. The time limit is twelve hours, ten underground. Females under twenty-one may not work underground. Children may not labor between 9 p. in. and 5 a. m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Netherlands, Greece, Bulgaria, Rumania and New Zealand fix the age limit at fourteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Germany the age limit is thirteen years. The time limit is six hours. Night work is forbidden. Parents may work their own children in their own factories or shops not to exceed three hours per day or during vacations four hours. In the coal districts boys fourteen years old may work underground seven hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Austria the age limit is twelve years. The time limit is eight hours. Night work between 8 p. m. and 5 a. m. is forbidden to women and children.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark35"></a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Child Labor</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">HILD labor does not mean selling newspapers after school, nor working a few hours on holidays. It means toiling long hours at machines in factories, slaving in fields, excessive tasks at low wages. It means , also no t</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font5">e for school, play, or healthy growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every state now has full power to make its own laws regarding child labor. There are good laws and bad ones, and five states with no restrictions at all. All children need protection; but the children of those five states need it most of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1920 census said that 1, 060,958 children are working. But this counts only those from ten to fifteen years old. Thousands of children less than ten years old are at work. Children less than six years old, working all day long,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Alice Parle</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">are discovered from time to time by investigators of the National Child Labor Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same time, while more than a million children are working, far more than a million men and women are unemployed. Setting the children free would be good for the children, and it would also give jobs to men and women who are now idle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the people who live in states which have good laws against child labor, and which enforce the laws they have, use goods produced in all the states. So all people in all the states are using articles produced in part by child labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All honor to the states which have set' a high standard in protecting their children from child labor. It is time now for the nation to act and to protect all the children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“There are several news items from Mexico that will be of interest to you. One is the land question, and the other is the weakening and breaking of the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The agrarians are constantly and persistently taking over the land of the big estates, those belonging to Americans as well as to Spaniards or Mexicans. Of course it causes a great deal of friction, and the common people are often unreasonable in their demands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Americans, of course, appeal to the Consulate, and the Consul writes to the local Mexican authorities and to the Department of State, and they bring the matter before the Mexican Federal authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In one instance the Mexican Government authorities ordered the local troops to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font4"> and put the trespassers off the land, but the troops refused to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Lately there has arisen what they call ‘Sismatices’ (in English, a split) among the priesthood of the Catholic church. Some of the priests decided that they would quit sending money to Rome, while others remain loyal to the Pope. There is quite a bit of disturbance among the priests throughout Mexico over this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In Mexico City the two factions were contending for the control of one of the largest churches of the city. So they finally appealed the case to President Calles; and he said he would settle it all right.: That both factions could Just get out, and the building should be used for a school. (I say three cheers for President Calles.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“You know how the Catholic church has always maintained that only those marriages performed by the priest are legal and valid, claiming that the children of other people not married by the church were illegitimate. Well, now, the Government has turned the tables </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">them, declaring that only civil marriage is legal and valid. The children born of parents married only by Catholic priests or bishops must bear their mother's name, and are called Tiijos natural’ that is illegitimate, and the wife’s legal status is ‘soltera’ which in English means ‘single’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now I say “hurrah” for the Mexican Government. Let us give them a good big pat on the back. They are certainly making great strides there towards a good' government, as well as towards religious liberty and common sense.</span></p>

Dr. Lomax said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What converted me into a lunacy reformer was this: The volume of complaints from all sources, their consistency, compelled me to believe in the existence of cruelty. It took me two years to convince myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“If you ask patients you will hardly find a case of a patient who has been in an asylum for any length of time who has not numberless cases of cruelty to relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have patients here now who will tell you of the most ghastly things that they have seen or that they have had done to themselves These things do exist. They exist beneath the surface, and until the public expresses its opinion in a note of horror and indignation they will go on existing. It is publicity alone that will stop all this sort of thing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">IL VER fox farming is a new and profitable ■ industry, although, its inception dates back to the year 1887, when Messrs. Dalton and Oul-ton began operations on Prince Edward Island, Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ Shortly afterwards .three sisters engaged in the business, and cleared $25,000 a year out of their venture. One fox pup brought $9,000; and twenty-five pelts sent to London were sold for $34,175. Some of the pelts were sold for from $2,500 to $2,700 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A real boom started. Michigan fell into line with Muskegon as the center of the fox-farming industry; there being no less than thirty-three silver fox farms in its immediate vicinity, and many more to northward along the Lake Michigan shore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not many really good fox skins are as yet placed in the markets, for the reason that the live foxes are worth much more for breeding purposes. A pair of good foxes will bring from $1,000 to $2,500, sometimes even more if they are prize winners; whereas a pelt brings $150 to $750.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the cull fox pelts are as yet put into the markets, or the pelts of undesirable foxes, such as a non-breeder or one that is somewhat offcolor or quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are altogether eight grades of pelts in the color scheme of these foxes. Of these we might mention the red, pale silver, silver, dark silver, extra dark silver and jet black, all of which have a white tip brush (tail). The pelt of the black fox is less in demand because of its liability to imitation by dyeing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is impossible to imitate the silver-black fox pelts; its guard hairs overlapping its fur have black ends with a silver ring next thereat, and that followed by black next to the skin, and interspersed with guard hairs that are jet black and from three to four inches in length. This, gives the pelt that beautiful and very desirable glossy silk sheen and high valuation. The underlying thick matted fur is very soft and fleecy, and is about an inch and a half in length and of a darker gray tinge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the early history of silver fox raising, breeding stock sold as high as $34,000 a pair, and individual pelts at $2,700. In 1922 there were upwards of 500 silver fox ranches with 15,000 foxes in captivity, representing an $8,000,000 investment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The United States Department of Agriculture issued </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> Bulletin-—No. 1151—of sixty pages, exclusively devoted to fox farming, and taking up in considerable detail every phase of the industry. It is profusely illustrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Facts About Silver Foxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE first silver foxes sold for breeding pur-*- poses was in 1905; and until 1909 this industry was a monopoly. Since then millions of dollars have, been paid in fox dividends. Mr. Dalton retired a millionaire in 1912.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fox can be tamed, but this is not desirable in fox farming. Foxes eat anything that a dog or a cat will eat. Meat, fish, bread, cereals, horsemeat, chickens, rabbits, eggs and milk are the chief foods; but mostly horsemeat in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It costs about $12 a year to feed a fox for commercial purposes. They usually breed in February and March, and have but one litter a year of from one to ten pups, the average number being about four. The breeding period is from one to ten years, and the total annual increase is about one hundred percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fox ranches can be built in groves, orchards, on hillsides or in the open, and must have plenty of sunlight. The prize foxes are inbred or line-bred. The best pelts are now worth from $300 to $750 each. Ninety percent of silver fox pelts going on the market today are ranch raised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to date all silver fox pelts have been readily marketed, without any artificial demand being created through advertising. Perhaps not one person in a thousand has ever seen a genuine silver fox or even the' fur of one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is estimated that all the pelts of all the silver foxes in captivity in the United States, if placed on the New York market, would be absorbed within six months’ time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief of the Biological Survey, U. S. Department of Agriculture, states that during the past ten years the meagre supply of fox fur has decreased only fifty percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In future all foxes registered must be inspected, scored, passed favorably upon and ear-tattood by an official of the National Fox-Breeders Association, and no fox scoring less than 80 points will be registered in the Herd Book of the Association; neither can its progeny be registered. This is intended to put the industry on a higher plane. Not over ten percent of cap-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">five foxes will score over eighty-five points; so says Mr. J. E. Smith, Association secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The combined silver fox industry in the United States and Canada is valued at over $20,000,000. Silver foxes are insurable up to three-fourths of their actual market value as breeders, C</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE writer had occasion to visit several fox farms, among them the large Silver-Black</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250715_files/g_E_19250715-10.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Fox Farm, one and one-half miles north of Hart in western Michigan, and to study it and its environments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The manager, Mr. Hancock, showed us all through the place, explaining in detail the characteristics of these beautiful little animals; and for oui’ close inspection he trapped a couple of them in a specially constructed wooden box trap. While he held them by the hind legs, they viciously bit at the cut-off trap slide. He parted the fur, and showed us the difference in quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the woodwork of the pens, kennels and buildings is painted white. The pens are 15 x 45 x 7 feet size, covered with fox wire two-inch mesh, and have a carpet of wire fifteen inches underground to prevent the foxes from digging out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The kennels are all staged sixteen inches above ground, allowing for snow depths, and are double boarded with tar building-paper between the walls and flooring. They are 2 x 2^ x 5 feet size,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sloping roof on hinges makes it convenient to open for inspection and for airing and cleaning out. The nest boxes are set into this and can easily be removed. These nest boxes contain about two inches of sifted gravel to absorb the moisture at breeding time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A wire cage 2i/<sub>2</sub> x 2% x 5 feet with top and bottom solid is attached to the outer end of the chute and three feet from the kennel. The foxes pass through the door of the cage and through this chute, in going to and from the kennel. This cage serves several purposes: (1) Separating the foxes; (2) sunning the puppies; (3) closing up an excitable mother fox lest she carry the puppies out and bury them; and (4) giving them separate feeds, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font5">tower thirty-five feet high is located in the center of the pen’s colony. During the breeding season this tower is occupied from 6 a. m. to 9 a. in. and from 3 p. m. to 6 p. m. by the keeper or his assistant without being seen by the ani- ‘ mals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is very necessary to watch and study carefully the actions of the foxes to be mated, and ' to note their habit and nature. If aware of be- ' ing observed, the foxes do not act naturally. ’’ A record is kept by this Mr. Lookout respecting the breeding time. This must be positively known and heeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The gestation period is fifty-one or fifty-two days, and the young are usually born in April and May. No one is allowed to go near the kennel in which are puppies. It excites the mother fox, and may mean the death of her litter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pens are thoroughly cleaned out daily. The animals are fed in soup bowls that are hung eighteen inches high on the wall netting; and these bowls are daily cleaned and sterilized just as thoroughly as the housewife cleans her table dishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fox ranch of which we are particularly speaking contains one hundred silver-black foxes, many of which were prize winners at the Montreal Fox Exhibit. Among them the Lady Hilda, Island Queen, Canuck Rose, Jack Canuck, . and others of prize-winning note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In feeding, some hide with the hair on must be given the foxes at intervals to remove internal worms, or the fox will chew off the tip of his tail, which is pure white two to four inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Round about the entire colony of fox pens and forty feet away from them, there is a ten-foot-high fox wire fence let one foot under ground, and overhanging two feet inwards to prevent foxes from escaping should one succeed in getting out of the pen, and to keep visitors far from the foxes at certain seasons of the year, especially during the breeding and whelping seasons, when visitors are not allowed to go near the fox pens, as it excites the females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only the keeper or caretaker is permitted to enter the pens; and even he must not go near the kennels in which there are puppies. The excitable mother will carry them out with a view to hiding them, and thus subject them to a cold; or she would smother them by burial in the earth of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Corwin Fox Farm has several hundred acres of land and deals in thoroughbred Jersey cattle as well as in silver fox raising. Its management has contracted with the management of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">Manistee fox ranch for the sale of seventy-</span></p><img src="g_E_19250715_files/g_E_19250715-11.png" alt="" style="width:524pt;height:668pt;">
<p><span class="font5">five percent of its pups of the years 1924, 1925 and 1926, which means a deal of $100,000 or $150,000; probably the largest fox deal of the state up to date. This ranch has very fine large well-kept buildings, and is situated on the Dixie Highway. The twenty-five percent reserve is for the keeping of its own stock of silver foxes. ! The English and French markets have taken most of the supply of fox pelts. The industry will continue to flourish after prices have been cut to a pelt basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The horsemeat food for the foxes is as carefully prepared as though a steer was being prepared for human consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Foxes will climb up the wire netting in an endeavor to escape. The top of the pen, therefore, must be covered over either in part along the side walls, or wholly, to keep them from getting out and away. Foxes sometimes injure themselves by falling from these high climbs. Sometimes a fox will manage to dig out, despite all watchfulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few years ago a keeper notified the ranch owner that one of the foxes had escaped, and was surprised at the apparent non-coneern of the owner. The ranch owner advised the keeper to guard well the other foxes, and stated that the escaped fox would not be gone long; and he was right. The next morning the lonesome fox returned, tired and hungry, and was re-admitted to the stock pen. But this does not always happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pair of self-locking tongs is used to slip around the neck of the fox when he needs to be removed from a crate for the purpose of handling or examination. This instrument. cannot injure nor hurt the animal; it is scientifically constructed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of all the grades the black fox is decidedly the handsomest, but is not worth the- most money, and for reasons already herein set forth. The taking of pelts requires expert knowledge. Only three or four weeks of each winter is the fox pelt “prime”. At other times it is less valuable, and should not be taken. This is because that in the “prime” season the guard hairs give out a better, or a less dark sheen over the silver base color; the jet black guard hairs lie down over the silver coat that hugs close to the animal’s skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a vast difference between the so-called “A-l&quot; silver fox and the first-class one. The latter is the prize winner, and is not easily purchased. There are some unscrupulous men in the fox-raising business, as there are in every other hue, and these will gull the people </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">every way they can; and defraud as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For instance, you buy from one of these men a pair of fine foxes; and he assures you the vixen is well bred, and you leave the pair with him until after whelping. You get a letter from this cheat, telling you that your female has brought forth two puppies, when in reality she perhaps gave birth to eight, six of which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font5">stows away for himself. No one is permitted to view the litter before the pups are about </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">month old. See how easily the man has defrauded you, stolen your puppies and taken away your profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The proper way is to remove the pair, and take no chances. Look after your own breeding, at your home. It is said that much crooked work goes on at some of the fox ranches. There are of course many very reliable and trustworthy fox ranchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Foxes are naturally active at night. During the day they are more quiet and remain much of the time curled up in their kennels (or dens), or on the top of them. Their natural inquisitiveness leads them to want to see everything that is going on around them. Moving. objects especially incite their keen interest. As a rule foxes live peacefully together; but they are quick to take advantage of a mate or of a neighbor if opportunity affords. They are easily excited; and as a rule they arc suspicious of strangers, and run to cover or sneak along the pen wall with the body held close to the ground upon the approach of a strange person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Foxes differ in temperament the same as do dogs and cats. Withal they are cunning, and not to be trusted. A linger poked through the fence mesh, at an apparently tame animal, is apt to be severely bitten; the hand gotten hold of is hung on to and wrenched at desperately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Foxes prefer no bedding material, although in some instances the fox will take to straw, The male fox is taken from the pen after breeding has taken place. He may do injury to the vixen or her puppies. He is sometimes fond of carrying the little ones about, and may have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">fight with the mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The business of fox raising is based on pelt value, which up to date is mostly cull product; that is, the old foxes, non-producers, or injured ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ The greatest obstacle ranches have to overcome in the fox industry is losses through diseases. Sanitation is most essential to success. .Were it not for the fecundity of foxes, their profitable production in the face of present heavy losses from disease and parasites would be out of the question. Distemper and other like diseases are highly fatal. Hookworm, tapeworm, and mange-mite are among the chief parasites that affect foxes in captivity. Young foxes are especially susceptible to disease, and must be given careful attention and have clean surroundings to insure immunity which maturity affords.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark98"></a>In Defense of Monkeys</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font5"> SEE in the papers that you human folks have up a hot argument on evolution, and I want you all to understand that we monkeys are interested in that. When it comes to. bringing such awful charges against the noble monkey race, as some of your scientists have done, it is time for us to speak up and defend ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A man by the name of Darwin made the statement that you can trace your ancestry back to us monkeys and, according to the latest information I can get, all your scholars of the present day accept the Darwinian theory, and claim that the truth of it is too strong to be denied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being an educated monkey, I have studied Darwin and his followers pretty carefully myself and I admit they put up some very plausible arguments. Some of their statements are no doubt very convincing to the limited mentality of a mere human, but to the strong intellect of a monkey they are as flimsy as cobwebs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now, Mr. Editor, with your kind permission, I will proceed to give your readers a few monkey reasons why the- Darwinian theory cannot be true..</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the first place, monkeys are peaceable folks. We never invented gunpowder, submarines, poison gas and TNT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have never had a great world war among ourselves and butchered up and starved 20,000,000 monkeys just to humor the whims of half</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Chimpan Z. Monkey</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a dozen monkey kings and kaisers. We have more sense than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We hardly ever get sick if we are let alone. It is only when taken captive and kept in your human society that we pine away and die prematurely. Therefore we have no use for doctors and drug stores, hospitals and hot water bottles. We have never had a lawsuit over a line fence, and we don’t need a great army of monkey lawyers to protect our personal interests from other monkeys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We don’t drink corn ‘Tikker” or smoke cigars, chew tobacco or dip snuff. We have more selfrespect than to touch these nasty things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We monkeys don’t have to malm money in order to live. We don’t have to sweat in dirty factories, nor sit humped up all day counting column after column of foolish figures on paper. We know how to get along and live our lives in peace without so much bother, and I’ll bet five bushels of cocoanuts, against your store teeth that we get more enjoyment out of life than you do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you men had half as much sense as monkeys, you surely could see that there is no blood relation between us. Our way of living is simple and satisfactory, while yours is very complicated and uncomfortable. The differences are far greater than the resemblances, and therefore any attempt to prove a common origin is bound to end in failure.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Criticisms Are Acceptable</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE received two criticisms on portions of the article, “Everlasting Life on Earth,” which appeared in The Golden Age, No. 138. This was the third time that article was republished, such was the demand for it by Our readers. One reader says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Saturn is shown in diagrams from two different views—one showing his rings thin and the other thick. The ring is also stated to be 2,000 miles thick outside the planet. The diagram showing the ring thick is wrong because Saturn presents such an appearance from no view whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should be noticed that the diagrams are not photographs, but illustrations designed to aid the mind in comprehending the article. An encyclopedia is quoted which says that the rings of Saturn are “probably” not more than one hundred miles in thickness. But we do not see the necessity of changing the author’s figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good authorities differ on the dimensions of these rings. There are two rings, one outer ring which is quite thin, and an inner ring which is much thicker; thick enough, in fact, to cast a dark shadow over the surface of Saturn. When Saturn is in the constellations Sagittarius and Gemini, his rings are presented more nearly sidewise; and when in the constellations Virgo and Pisces, the rings appear to be a bar of light when seen through a large telescope. As Saturn is more than 483,000,000 miles from the sun, it would seem that if the shadow produced by the rings can be seen from the earth they should be more than one hundred miles in thickness, especially since the rings are vaporous and not solid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An objection is also made to the item on nitrogen gas in the same article, where it was stated that nitrogen gas threatened to annihiliate the human race. Mr. J. A. Hamilton says in part :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As far as my knowledge goes, there is no surplus nitrogen in our atmosphere; the proportion of nitrogen and oxygen is a fixed combination. All the ammonia (nitrogen) given off in the decomposition of dead bodies does not add one iota to the nitrogen content of the air, because it is simply washed out again by rain, snow and dew. Nor is there anything devitalizing in the nitrogen of our atmosphere; it simply dilutes the oxygen to the right amount to suit the respiratory organs of all living things. If the oxygen content of the air were ever doubled the whole combustible material on the earth would be burnt up, because no fire could be extinguished I When our glorious Creator made the earth’s atmosphere He made it perfect, as is all His handiwork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The fault is with the poor, sin-cursed humanity. Their blood is so degenerated today that it doesn’t absorb the oxygen it should. If the oxygen content were perceptibly increased it would, take all our time eating to satisfy the voracious appetites that we would then have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Yes, nitrogen is a good fertilizer; but it has to bo used with discretion and knowledge. Too much nitrogen is just as bad as not enough.

<p><span class="font7">Th© Poof Savage </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From The Upholsterers Journal</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fpHE poor, ignorant savage ventured to put a few questions to the pious missionary who wished to save him from his benighted condition, and to confer upon him the benefits of civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">,.. &quot;You say that I should work?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Yes, certainly, my poor, good brother. Satan finds evil for idle hands to do!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Who is Satan?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“He is the devil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Does he live in your country, then?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Alas, my sinful friend, he lives everywhere,” said the good man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, he’s never done me any harm,” said the savage, “so I think I’d better stay as I am.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No, no!” cried the old man. “Your life of idleness is wicked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Do all people work in your country?” asked the savage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Work hard?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Um—most of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And are all those who work hard, quite happy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Er—no,” replied the missionary, hesitatingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Why is that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, you see, there is a great deal of poverty,” the good man explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What! Among those who work hard?” asked the poor savage in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wes, it is indeed so,” admitted the good man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Then I suppose those who do not work at all have an awfully bad time ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, no. As a matter of fact, they are so rich that they need not work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The savage mused in silence for a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'-What do you mean by poverty?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Not having enough to eat nor good houses to live in,” the missionary explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Why is that? Is there a scarcity of food in your land?”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“N—o,” said the good man, slowly, “there is plenty of food, but don’t you understand, they are poor, and have little money, so, of course, cannot buy food, nor afford nice houses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But I think you said they worked very hard,” said the poor savage, with patience at the other’s stupidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Yes, that is so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Why do they work so hard?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“To get money to buy food,” 'replied the missionary with a touch of impatience at the other’s stupidity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Well, why don’t they buy the food?” said the savage. “Do they like being hungry?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Of course not, but they don’t earn enough.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And yet they work as hard as they can, I suppose?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The savage pondered before he spoke again. “On this island,” he said, “I do not have to work to any extent; and when I’m hungry I take my food from the trees or the sea. By the way, what do you call your country?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Civilization,” replied the good man, blushing slightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I don’t think it would be good for us if your customs were introduced here,” said the poor savage thoughtfully. Won will pardon me, sir, if I say that I think your country must be a dreadful place to live. Good afternoon ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">T THE University of Geneva 28 fishes were placed in a deep glass bowl of water and the temperature of the entire contents gradually reduced to below zero.

<p><span class="font7">An Unscientific [?] Scientist</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font5">VERY student of nature should be reverential, for all creation is. a constant reminder ©f the multiplicity of the wisdom of the Creator. He is exalted not only in the mighty planets of the heavens hut in the little things as well. Every creature and every plant gives silent testimony of His wondrous majesty and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the study of biology we learn that there are varied “trophisms” in nature — a trophism being an inborn organic tendency of the nervous system to execute involuntary movements which are beneficial to the sustenance of the organism. The baby loggerhead turtle, for example, when hatched on land will turn instinctively away from red, green or yellow, but will readily turn toward transparent blue. It is this trophism which leads him unerringly to the water and to his natural home in the deep sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an excellent example of geotrophism (obedience to gravity) in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">convohitas,</span><span class="font5"> a kind of sea worm. This worm, if placed in still water far inland, where there is no ebb and flow of tide, will nevertheless continue to ascend to the surface of the water at the hour when there should be low tide, and will descend when the time comes for the tide to ordinarily rise. When the tides in the ocean happen to be irregular, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">convolutas</span><span class="font5"> will, though in still water, keep accurate time with the tides’ movements just the same, thereby showing that this trbphism is no mere periodical, mechanical movement on its part, but that it is controlled by some higher law of instinct, beyond the biologist’s field of vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Similarly, in that other wing of biology known as botanical physiology (the study of plant life) we soon strike the mysterious and marvelous. The seed dies in giving birth to a new life. Though it is buried in the ground and soon becomes totally extinct (John 12:24; 1 Cor. 15: 36), passing entirely into oblivion, yet the marvel of nature’s resurrection, by means of sunshine, warmth and moisture, yields a new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If sown on barren or dry soil the seed will not produce. But in moist and fertile soil the mysterious protoplasmic germ is activated and growth immediately starts in the seed. First the stalk, then the leaves, then the ear, and finally the full corn in the ear. What is the explanation of this mystery of life ? The study of biogenesis (beginning of life) soon shows there</span></p>

Astronomical students watch the whirling worlds in the vast canopy of the heavens, speeding through unending space at marvelous velocities. At first the immensity of this revelation of the universe appalls and alarms them. Afterwards, reflecting on the exactness and precision of the movements of these enormous bodies they realize the mightiness of the mind that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">must </span><span class="font5">govern it all, and calmly admit these wonders </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">be beyond human comprehension.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font5">N SPITE of all this evidence of intelligent creation some editorial writers with whom the most recondite secrets of our mundane sphere and those of the mighty universe are as familiar as the Statue of Liberty (minus the torch), rise to take a pot-shot at some one of the few remaining true, honest and humble scientists of our day who are old-fashioned enough to still give God credit for the works of His hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One such case is that of George Washington Carver, M. A., B. Sc., F. R. S., professor at Tuskegee Institute, Alabama. Professor Carver, who, incidentally, is the son of a Missouri slave, is now in charge of the Research and Experimental Station of Tuskegee where he was placed by Dr. Booker T.

<p><span class="font5">'--Giving God the credit is the unscientific (?) part of Dr. Carver’s scientific work. Some weeks ago he gave a lecture in New York city and described to an eager and enthusiastic audience </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">original experiments which have resulted in ' one hundred or more by-products taken from the ,®weet potato, such as ink, shoe blacking, coffee Substitute, rubber, etc., and his one hundred and Isixty-five by-products made from the peanut. In his lecture Dr. Carver attributed his successes to the aid of God. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font5">commenting editorially concerning his lecture, said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup>' “It is for chemists to determine to what extent Dr. George W. Carver of Tuskegee is worthy of recognition. Whether eminent or not, he seems to have done useful work in developing new uses for several common Southern products. ... It is therefore to be regretted . . . that Dr. Carver, in discussing his own achievements, should use language that reveals a complete lack of the scientific spirit. Real chemists, or at any Tate, other real chemists, do not scorn books out of which they can learn what other chemists have done, and they do</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">not ascribe their successes, when they .have any, to ‘inspiration’.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the foregoing Dr. Carver replied as follows: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> regret exceedingly that such a gross misunderstanding should arise as to what I meant by ‘divine inspiration’. Inspiration is never at variance with information; in fact, the more information one has, the greater will be the inspiration. Paul, the great scholar, says (2 Timothy 2:15), ‘Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.’ Again he says in Galatians 1:12, ‘For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In relation to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> editorial Dr. Carver expressed to the writer of this article his surprise that the opinion seemed to prevail “that in really big things, the ‘ego’ was the thing to emphasize.” He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I know that my Redeemer liveth. I know the source from whence my help comes. Inspiration, as I used the word in my New York lecture, means simply God speaking to man through the things He has created; permitting him to interpret correctly the purposes the Creator had in permitting them to come into existence. I am not interested in any science that leaves God out; in fact, I am not interested in anything that leaves out God.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark107"></a>“The Sign of Fire” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Gerald Berry</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font5">ANCIENT times, before the telegraph or the telephone had been invented, a primitive method of conveying quickly an alarm or warning throughout a country, in case it was invaded </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">’or </span><span class="font5">threatened with invasion, by an enemy was the method known as “the sign of fire”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">( Beacon hills were chosen on which a beacon fire was lit that could be seen for miles around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' The inhabitants of the villages and towns around, seeing the “sign of fire”, and knowing that it betokened the danger of invasion by an enemy, immediately proceeded to light a beacon ‘fire on their respective beacon hills. And’thus within a few hours the alarm would spread throughout the entire country. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Readers of English history are familiar with the account of the lighting of the beacon fires when the Spanish Armada was sighted in the days of Queen Elizabeth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following extract from the “Encyclopaedia Britannica” (Vol 3. p. 562) is of interest, in this connection:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Beacon (from the old English </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">beacn,</span><span class="font4"> a sign . . .)', a signal; especially a fire lit on a high hill, structure or building for the purpose of sending a message of alarm or of important news over long distances. Such was the courier-fire . . . that brought the news of the fall of Troy to Argos ... or the chain of signals that told of the approach of the Spanish Armada.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> This method of signalling was evidently very ancient; for the prophet Jeremiah refers to it in the following words: “0 ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a sign of fire</span><span class="font5"> in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.”—Jeremiah 6:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While this was evidently literally done in the days of Jeremiah, just before Jerusalem was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar's army, yet there is an antitypical fulfilment to this prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age has already called attention to the fact that Jeremiah foreshadows the feet members of the Body of Christ and their experiences (Golden Age, No 27), and has briefly referred to the antitypical fulfilment of this very prophecy in the following words: “There are millions of people within the ranks of the nominal church—Catholic and Protestant—who love the Lord, yet who have not sufficient courage to boldly withstand the clergy. . . . When the present order is upset in revolutionary troubles and the Babylonish systems fall completely, the consecrated children of the Lord within her walls will be released. . . . The latter will then have their mental vision opened and in sorrow and dismay will cry: ‘The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.’ (Jeremiah 8: 20) In fact, as the Prophet shows, the knowledge of their negligence and consequent loss dawns upon them just before Babylon's fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He says: ‘0 ye children of Benjamin [great company] gather yourselves [together] to flea out of the midst of Jerusalem [that is to say, Forsake your places among the ruling classes, prominent in the churches], and blow the trumpet [message of present truth] in Tekoa [meaning pitched tents or organizations] and set up a sign of fire [signifying, forming Bible classes, learning and proclaiming the message of present truth in this time of fiery trouble] : . . . for evil appeareth out of the north [seat of divine empire, signifying that the approaching trouble is of divine permission and arrangement], and [shall result in] great destruction.’ (Jeremiah 6:1; Isaiah 13:6)”—Golden Age for September 29th, 1920, page 723.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This shows, then, that the antitypical meaning of the “sign of fire” is the starting of Bible study classes throughout the country, whereby people can learn from the Bible the significance of the great time of trouble coming, and the reasons therefor; and, if they desire so to do, they may profit by the warning thus given.</span></p>

Here is the text of the League Prayer, of which the well known Harry Emerson Fosdick, D. D. is the reputed author. It is said to be repeated by many League devotees from the walls of their homes, read from a card, a copy of which has fallen into my hands.

<p><span class="font4">(Feel, As You Pray, That Endless Others Are Aspiring With You. More Things Are Wrought By Prayer Than This World Dreams Of.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the reader has to do is to compare this prayer with that of the Redeemer, to note its divergence from the divine program. Jesus prayed NOT for the. world at all, but only for his disciples, saying, “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” Moreover, He implied that “Modernists” have no right to “declare his statutes”, or to “take his covenant” into their mouths, because their hearts are far from Him. The Rev. Mr. Fosdick is an avowed Modernist, entirely faithless as to the virgin birth, the ransom of the cross, and the need of a resurrection hope. Then how could he even address the Almighty? Such prayers never reach beyond the roof, much less do they reach the ears of the Holy One.. The first element of contrition is woefully lacking in this League prayer, while the precepts of men are in evidence with every sentence. Therefore, out of their own mouths shall they be judged as worthy of Elijah’s sharp arrows of truth: ‘Cry a little louder, all ye modern Baalites. Mayhap, your god is asleep or gone on a long journey!’ —1 Kings 18: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indeed, it is not the Lord’s will to bring quietude now to the human spirit without strife, hence we can pray only according to prophetic instructions. Revolution is the next step in the overthrow of all Satanic pride and the tyranny of the oppressors—big business and big clergy. The prayer of the Christian is “Thy kingdom come”, and that by the dissolution of the devil’s empire. No patchwork can possibly remedy the gougings and graft of the market sharks and the profiteers of commercialism. The system is. destined to desolation like the prototype of Jerusalem. Thereafter it won’t be necessary to pay twenty-five cents for a few leaves of lettuce. This profiteering is a travesty on nature’s bounty.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark112"></a>The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By judge j. F. Rutherford</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(This lecture was delivered bv Judge Rutherford to a large and attentive audience in Barcelona, Spain. on May 10, 1925, It wal the first time such a message had been heard by the Spanish people in their native land. Great interest was aroused by this memory able address which was also published in the newspapers throughout Spain.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font5">HIS subject holds peculiar interest to the people of Spain. What I shall tell you on this occasion should thrill the heart of every Spaniard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">History records that more than four hundred years ago all the learned men of Spain believed that there was a fountain of perpetual youth to be found somewhere in the vicinity of the Bahama Islands, off the southeastern coast of America. Ponce de Leon, a noted Spanish discoverer who was a companion of Columbus on his second voyage of discovery, had been appointed by the King of Spain to the position of governor of Porto Rico. He was growing old, and was anxious to find the much-talked-of fountain of eternal youth. With this object in mind he set sail to find it. On Easter Sunday, March 27th, 1512, he landed on a distant coast covered with evergreen forests and blanketed with beautiful flowers. The air was scented with the perfume from the flowers, and the numerous birds sang the praises of the Creator. It reminded De Leon of the description of the garden of Eden. He was certain that he was in the land containing the fountain of eternal youth. He named the land Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">De Leon was not the only one who has vainly sought the place and condition of perpetual life in happiness. For more than six thousand years this has been the hope and dream of man. Why? Because life is the dearest thing to mankind. The mere fact that the great Creator planted this desire in the heart of man is proof that some day God would lead all the peoples of earth to know how they might live on earth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Jesus was on earth He said to the people: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How do we know the people may actually find the fountain of perpetual youth? The Scriptures answrnr: ‘It is the will of God that all men shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth and that in God’s due time.’ (1 Timothy 2: 3-6) We may be sure then that in God’s due time the people will be given such knowledge. My purpose is to prove to you that we are now entering that wonderful time when the knowd-edge of the Lord shall begin to fill the earth that the people may learn how they may obtain peace, happiness and everlasting life. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I come </span><span class="font5">to bring you a message of good news, which will give you joy in your hearts if you will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font5">ceive it.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>The Scriptures</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font5">HE sacred Scriptures constitute God’s Word of Truth given to man for Iris instruction in righteousness. Why have the people been kept in ignorance of God’s wonderful arrangement to give them life? The Scriptures answer: Because &quot;Satan, the god of this 'world, hath blinded the minds [of the people] lest the glorious good ne^vs of Jesus Christ should shine into their hearts.’ (2 Corinthians 4:3,4) The prophet of God then tells us that gradually the light shall increase until that perfect day when all shall know the Lord and His ways of righteousness and life. If this is the due time for us to understand the Scriptures, then we should all be glad and give thanks to the Lord. My purpose here is to tell you that the time has come for the Bible to be understood, and that it is the only source of knowledge concerning man’s eternal happiness.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>Creation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">ipHE Scriptures show that God created Adam </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font5">a perfect man and placed him in Eden, a perfect home; that had Adam remained in harmony with God he would have lived on the earth forever, and that his children would have been perfect and would have enjoyed the blessings ofl earth, because God made the earth for man to live on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam and Eve violated Go'd’s law, and they ■were sentenced to death. (Genesis 3:15-24) They were expelled from their perfect home; they were gradually put to death by being compelled to eat the poisonous foods of the earth. They had no children until after they were expelled from Eden. Their children w<sup>r</sup>ere therefore born in sin and shapen in iniquity, as the Prophet tells us in Psalm 51:5. St. Paul says this same thing; that is, that by Adam s disobedience sin entered into the world and death </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">a result of sin, and for this reason all the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hu</span><span class="font5">man race has been dying.—Romans 5:12,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">/ God is just; and He could do nothing else hut sentence Adam to death for the violation of , His. law. God is love; and His loving heart caused Him to make provision for the redemption and restoration of man, that man might yet have an opportunity for everlasting life. He has permitted man to suffer in body and in mind for many centuries in order that he might have a full and complete lesson in the baneful effects of sin; but now the time has come for him to show the peoples of the world that if they obey Him they shall live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To Abraham God made the promise: &quot;In thy seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” (Gen. 12: 3) The apostle Paul tells us that this promised blessing means an opportunity to have everlasting life. How would it be possible for Adam and his children to be blessed when they were sinners? The answer is that God's law provided that another perfect man, equal to Adam, might be permitted to die in Adam’s place, and the value of his sacrifice be a purchase price for the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God made a promise that He would redeem man from death and ransom him from the power of the grave. This promise reads as follows: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.” (Hosea 13:14) The Psalmist tells us that there has been no man on earth who could redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him. (Psalm 49: 7) The reason of this is because all of the human family descended from Adam and were therefore imperfect and incapable of redeeming the race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The promise that God made to Abraham was renewed to Isaac to Jacob and to the prophets, and the Jewish nation looked forward to the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font5">e coming when they should have a kingdom through which the blessings would come to all people. Two thousand years after the promise was made, Jesus came to earth. All of you are familiar with the Biblical story of the birth of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mary was Jesus’ mother, but Joseph was not His real father. He was the Son of God, and His mother Mary, was a virgin. She went to Bethlehem to give birth to the child. On the night of the birth an angel appeared unto the shepherds watching their flocks and said: &quot;Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be unto all people, for unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2: 9-11) Here again was the promise of God reiterated in this message tljat some day all the peoples of earth would know that the birth of Jesus is good news of great joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus grew to perfect manhood. &quot;When thirty years of age He began His ministry, and for three and one half years He taught the people. Only a few believed Him, the majority rejected Him. Then it was that the Jews caused Him to be put to death on the cross. Three days thereafter God raised Him out of death and He ascended into heaven. St. Peter says that He was put to death as a man and raised from the dead a life-giving spirit being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The death and resurrection of Jesus was the greatest event in the history of the human race. Why did Jesus come and why did He die? He said that He came to give Himself a ransom for mankind. (Matthew 20:28) This is exactly what God, through the prophet Hosea, promised . should be done. Again Jesus said that He came that the people might have life. (John 10:10) How could they get life through him? The apostle Paul answers, in Hebrews 2:9: “We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, . . . that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man.” He died upon the cross. And for whom did he die? The Scriptures answer: &quot;For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” (1 Timothy 2: 5, 6) So we see that God promised that in due time every one shall hear about the value of Jesus’ sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After Jesus had ascended into heaven the holy spirit was given to His disciples at Pentecost. There began the selection of the Church, which is the Body of Christ; and when the Church is all selected and glorified with the Lord, God’s promised blessings will come to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before Jesus went away He said to His disciples (John 14:1-4): “I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go ... I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” He always spoke about the king, dom of God. He taught His disciples to pray: “Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as in heaven.” The peoples of Spain and off</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">every other country &quot;where Christ’s name has been known have repeatedly offered this prayer. Surely we have all expected this prayer to be fulfilled some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The coming of the Lord and the setting up of His kingdom, and the blessing of the families of the earth according to the promise, has been the great hope of Christian people. The question has always been: How might we know when these things would come to pass ?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>The End of the World</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE all been taught that this would transpire when the world comes to an end. The Jews had this same thought, as well as the Gentiles. The disciples of Jesus were taught by Him for three and one-half -years particularly about the kingdom, the end of the world, and the blessings that should follow. So keenly were they interested in this that one day they came to Him and propounded this question: ‘Master, tell us, how may we know when these things shall come and when the world shall end<sup>1</sup>?’ (Matthew 24: 3) Jesus knew how to answer that question and He did answer; and His answer is in prophetic words. By prophetic words I mean that He foretold a long time in advance what would be the proof when the world would come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If I should tell you to walk to the East, and to keep on walking for weeks and months, and that at some point in the East you would find a sign-board upon which are written certain tilings, and that when you found such a signboard you would know that you had come to a place of great treasure; and then if you should travel East and find this sign-board you would be greatly pleased when you had reached it, and you would begin diligently to seek for the treasure. Jesus told His followers that they should travel on indefinitely, that they would come to such a sign-board or sign of the times, that certain things would happen in the end of the age, and that by these things they would know that the world has come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before I read you the answer of Jesus to this question I want to give you some other information that students of prophecy have recently found out. The Jews were God’s chosen people for a long time. In the year 606 B. C. God cast off the Jews and permitted the Gentiles to form a universal empire. He then stated through the prophet Ezekiel that the Jews should be trodden down until He comes whose right it is to rule. Through the prophet Jeremiah He showed that the “times of the Gentiles” would be a period of 2520 years; and from 606 B. C. to 1914 A. D. is 2520 years. The careful students of prophecy therefore expected something to transpire in 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now with this date in mind let us note the answer to the question which the disciples asked of Jesus: ‘How may we know when the world comes to an end?’ Jesus replied: ‘Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom ; there shall be famines, pestilences, earthquakes in divers parts of the earth, and these things shall be the beginning of sorrows.’ (Matthew 24: 7, 8) You are all witnesses to the fact that this prophecy began to have its fulfilment in 1914, just at the end of the Gentile times. The war started, then the great famine in Russia and in other parts of the earth, followed shortly afterwards by the great epidemic of Spanish influenza which swept the whole earth; and there have been more earthquakes since 1914 than at any other time prior thereto, ineluding the great earthquake at Lisbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We begin to wonder then what is meant by the term “world”. Many have thought that the world meant the earth, and that when the world came to an end the earth would be burned up; but the Lord’s Word says the earth abideth forever. (Ecclesiastes 1:4) And God made the earth for man’s habitation. (Isaiah 45:12,18) We know that the Greek word from which the word “world” is translated means order of government or society. Then we understand that when the time of the end comes there shall be a gradual change to different conditions among the governments, until the Lord’s kingdom is fully in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus further stated, as an evidence of the end of the world, that God’s favor would begin to return to the Jews. You all know that after the Paris Conference in 1919 the Jews began to establish themselves in their homeland of Palestine, and that recently they have dedicated their great university, and that the Jews are rapidly rebuilding Palestine; and this is one of the best evidences that the new order is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another proof of the end of the world was given by the Lord in answer to the disciples’ question: He said there would be ‘distress of nations, with perplexity, men’s hearts failing them for fear o£ what they see coming on the world.’ We all bear witness to the fact that the nations and peoples have been in great distress </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">the last few years and are so now. Then </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus </span><span class="font5">added: ‘When you see these things beginning to come to pass, look up, lift up your heads, the time of deliverance is at hand.’ (Luke 21:28) We understand by this that He meant that these things would be evidence that His kingdom is here, and that the time had come </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">His blessings to be extended to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord then showed that there would be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">season of peace between the end of the Great War and the final trouble upon the earth. The war suddenly ended in 1918, and today we see all the nations feverishly preparing for another great war. This is described in the Scriptures as the greatest time of trouble that was ever on earth. Note the words of Jesus, recorded in Matthew 24:21, 22, as follow’s: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.” This is in harmony with Daniel’s prophecy, chapter twelve, verse one, which reads: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince vfliich standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here then we have strong corroborative proof that the old world has ended, that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and that the long-promised blessing of the people is soon to take place. This great time of trouble that is just ahead w’ill be short. What should you do during that time of trouble? The Prophet answers : “Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” (Zephaniah 2:2,3) My advice to you is to keep out of all kinds of trouble, to pursue a peaceful course, be law abiding, kind and considerate with your neighbors, and wait upon the Lord. In due time He will give you His blessing.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>God’s Kingdom</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250715_files/g_E_19250715-13.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">O THOROUGHLY had the Lord taught His disciples to pray for the coming of God’s kingdom and for His will to be done on earth that we may be sure that with the establishment of that kingdom a time of blessing will come to all people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the days of Eden there has been but little joy in the earth. The people have suffered sickness, sorrow and death, persecution and much trouble. But the Lord’s kingdom will be a kingdom of righteousness. It is written by the prophet of God concerning that kingdom of righteousness, as follows: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.”—Isa. 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the people of all nations are burdened with taxation to meet the preparation for another terrible war, but under the reign of the great Messiah, the Prince of Peace, wars will cease and the people will settle down to peaceful conditions. Concerning this God’s prophet wrote: “And he'shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”—Isaiah 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now many peoples of earth are starving for want of food. When the kingdom of God is in full sv<sup>r</sup>ay this will be changed. Concerning that time the Prophet says: “Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">God; </span><span class="font5">. . . ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you.—Joel 2: 23-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the people find that they must fight against thorns, thistles and weeds in order to grow their crops. When Messiah’s kingdom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">in full sway these pestilential things will disappear, as it is written:“Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree; and' it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.”—Isaiah 55:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now comparatively few peoples on earth own their homes and live in happiness. Somebody else owns the home, and they have to pay rent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But the Lord has promised that under His rule of righteousness these conditions shall change. Of that time the Prophet says: “And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.” (Ezekiel 28: 26) And again the Prophet says: “And they shall build homes, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall ■ long enjoy the work of their hands.”—Isaiah 65:21,22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now so many suffer from sickness and disease, but soon conditions will change with the new order, under the care of Messiah, Christ the Lord. The people will learn how to eat, how to sleep, how to take care of themselves, and above all learn how to do right; and then the Lord will bless them with health, as He promised: “Behold, I will bring in health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” (Jeremiah 33: 6) “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick; the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” (Isaiah 33: 24) The World War destroyed the eyesight of many people. The Lord will restore their sight during His reign. The promise is: “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of. the deaf shall be unstopped.”'—Isaiah 35:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures show that Jesus comes to judge the living and the dead. (2 Timothy 4:1) We may be sure then that those who are living will be the first ones to have an opportunity for life. We have come now to the time of the Lord’s kingdom, and what blessings shall we expect at that time? The Scriptures answer: &quot;Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">prohet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say. unto you.”—Acts 3:19-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Restitution means to restore to the people the rights which they lost through father Adam. Jesus bought these rights and He will begin to restore these rights to man, and gradually men of the earth will gain health and strength and happiness. These blessings, however, will not result to those who are evil, because those who continue in evil shall be destroyed. But those who want to do right, and will strive to do right, shall be fully restored to perfect manhood. All of the prophets foretold this time of restitution. Prophecy, however, cannot be understood until the time of its fulfilment,. and since we have come to that time that is why it can now be understood; and now the message of Jesus’ birth and Jesus’ kingdom is indeed beginning to be good news to all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">IFE is a gift from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord, as the Holy Scriptures state in Romans 6:23. Nobody could accept </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">gift without knowing about it. Therefore the people of the world, before they could be restored, must know that &quot;this is what the Lord is going -to do for them.. They could not know this until God’s due time. Now we have come to the end of the world, to the time of the Lord’s kingdom, and this is God’s due time for the people to know the way that leads to life and happiness. The troubles in the earth, the wars, famines, pestilences, revolutions and earthquakes are for the purpose of awakening the people to a realization that the old order of things is passing away and that God’s kingdom is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who then will receive the blessings the Lord has promised? Will it be only those who go tq heaven? The Scriptures answer, No. Only </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">small number of people will ever go to heaven, and that heavenly class is now about completed. But the time has now come for the whole world </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">begin to get its blessings. God’s prophet, writing concerning this time, said: “When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die. Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.”—Ezekiel 18: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people should now be encouraged to give up wrong and turn to righteousness, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and do right; and the promise is that those who now do so shall not die. Jesus referred to the present time when He said: “Verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.” (John 8:51) You could not keep the sayings of the Lord Jesus if you did not know about them; and when you do know about them, and keep them, then this promise will be fulfilled to you. Again Jesus said: “Whosoever liveth and believe th in me shall never die.” (John 11: 26) No man can believe unless he is taught, and then he must exercise faith in the Lord and in His promises. Since these prophecies were to have a fulfilment under the reign of Christ, and since the evidence is clear that the old world has now ended and that Christ’s kingdom is here, it can truly be said now that there are millions of people living on earth who will never die if they are obedient to the Lord. It has not been God’s due time for the people to know about this until these recent years, and now the knowledge is being brought to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why was Ponce de Leon and all other wise men of Spain looking for a fountain of eternal youth? Had they found anything in the Holy Scriptures about man returning to his youth? I answer, Yes. It has been in the Scriptures all the time, but it was not God’s due time for it to be fully understood. These prophecies could not be understood and their true meaning disclosed until the Lord’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the 33rd chapter of Job we read a prophetic description of the miserable condition in which the people now find themselves. The Prophet describes it in these words: “He [man] is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen, stick out.” Then we notice that there </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">a promise of a change of conditions. The Prophet mentions the messenger and interpreter. The prophet Isaiah says that the Messenger and Interpreter is Christ, the great Teacher and Lifegiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Continuing, the prophecy in Job says: “If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness.” The Lord will teach the people to be righteous and they shall learn righteousness. And then God, being gracious to mankind, says: “Deliver him from going down to the grave.” As the people begin to learn that this is true they will respond in the language of the Prophet: “I have found a ransom,” I know my redeemer. Note then the wonderful promise the Lord, through His prophet, gives to His people, and what shall be the coming condition of man: “His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he shall return to the days of his youth.&quot; </span><span class="font5">—Job 33:19-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here then is where man will find the fountain of eternal youth. In this coming kingdom the dream of the wise men of Spain and of the great explorers and discoverers who went out from Spain, will be realized. The peoples living in Spain and those in all other parts of the earth will then learn of this way of eternal youth through the ministration of Messiah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your wise men who looked for that fountain of youth have been dead for many years. They are in the grave, unconscious; but they will be brought out. Jesus said: “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in 'the winch all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28,29) Again the Scriptures say: “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”-—Acts 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those living on the earth when the kingdom is set up will be the first ones to have an opportunity to obey the Lord and live and be restored to their days of their youth. Then the dead will be brought forth and given an opportunity for life. Your loved ones that have gone from you will be restored; and that will be a happy, blessed time when all of these shall come to life through Christ and. His righteous kingdom. Then indeed it will be true that the birth of Jesus is good news to all, which shall come to all people. God’s promises are sure and will be fulfilled. The Apostle states that the reign of Christ shall result in the destroying of all man’s enemies, and that the last enemy that will be destroyed is death. (1 Corinthians 15:25,26) When all the wilfully wicked of the earth are destroyed, when all the obedient ones are restored, then it will be a happy race of people on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Edenic paradise. The Prophet writes: “And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that pass by. And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste, and desolate, and ruined cities, are become fenced, and are inhabited.”—Ezekiel 36: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blind shall see and the deaf shall hear, and the people shall rejoice. Concerning this the Prophet says: “Then the eyes of the. blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert. And the parched ground shall become a pool, .and the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of dragons where each lay, shall be grass, with reeds and rushes.”-—Isaiah 35:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the people will then be happy and joyful because their dead friends are returning to them is surely testified to by the Prophet, who says: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall' flee away.”—Isaiah 35:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. The reign of Christ will bring the full desire of every honest man. The final result is beautifully stated by the Eevelator in these words: “I saw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.” Heaven means the invisible ruling powers. Earth means organized society on earth. The devil has been the ruler of the old heavens. The Lord will be the ruler of the new. The devil has been the god of this world. The Lord Jesus Christ is the god</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- of the new. In symbolical phrase the Scriptures describes this, saying: “And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.”—Revelation 21:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Npw then, the way to live on earth forever is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, accept the terms of life offered by Jehovah through Him, and serve Him faithfully. The time for. life, liberty, and happiness is here. This surely is good news to your ears. And it being good news you should go tell your neighbor about it and say to him, The kingdom of heaven is at hand, the time for our deliverance is at hand, and we will serve the Lord and do his holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Faith </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Baroness Heylcing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font5">AITH is that attitude of mind which reaches beyond material things unto the threshold of the ideal. “Without faith it is impossible to please him [God]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Faith is the key which loosens the shackels of desire which bind soul and sense, and by faith alone is man able to vision worlds unknown and obtain a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">true</span><span class="font5"> perspective of the value of the temporal joys of this phase of life in relation to the ultimate plan of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A NEW voTume put out by the Anglo-Catholic or High Church branch of the Church of England has the following to say about the 'daily diet and apparel in what may be called the ecclesiastical hell. Of course there is no connection between this and the Bible hell, as any of our readers can ascertain by addressing us on the subject. The money must be coming harder than usual, or modern ecclesiastics would never resort to this effusion of the dark ages. The title of the book is the “Blessed Sacrament”. Please find the blessedness in what follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When they who have led lives of pleasure, of covetousness, of self-willed sin come to be upon their deathbeds . . . they may perhaps wish to pass into nothing, for to be nothing were better than to be in the strong grip of Satan and the intolerable heats of hell ... </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">living in fire, the feeding on fire, the breathing fire, the being clothed in fire, the thirsting for cool water where all, all, all is fire—above, beneath, on this side, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">that side, a far-stretching country of burning fire.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>! 426</sup>It might be reasonably expected that the clergy of various denominations would be anxious to know and anxious to tell the people about the presence of the Lord, and would therefore joyfully receive any news concerning His presence. We find the facts to be just to the contrary, however; and we again notice that this is one of the evidences given by Jesus Himself marking His second presence. He said:<sup>1</sup> “But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming [presence] of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not, until the flood came, and took them all away: so shall also the coming [presence] of the Son of man be.” (Matthew 24: 37-39) Instead of joining in the proclamation, ‘Behold the Bridegroom! the Lord has returned, the kingdom is at hand,’ these clergymen as a class scoff and jeer; and if they say anything concerning the Lord’s second presence, even though they get all their information from what Pastor Bussell wrote, they discredit him and mock and scoff at what. he wrote or said. Of course the Lord foreknew this; and therefore He caused the Apostle under inspiration to write: “There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming [presence] ? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”—2 Peter 3: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">END OF THE WORLD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' <sup>427</sup>Jesus having taught His disciples concerning His second coming, and having informed them that the world would end at or during that time, they desired to know how they might be able to ascertain the fact of His presence and what would be the indication, or proof of it to them or to any one. He was sitting on the side of the Mount of Olives when His disciples came to Him privately and propounded the question:- “Tell us, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">when</span><span class="font5"> shall these-things be? and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">what</span><span class="font5"> shall be the sign [proof or indication] of thy presence, and of the end of the world?&quot; (Matthew 24:3) The word world as here used does not mean the earth. The earth will never end or pass away; for “God himself that formed the earth and made, it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.” (Isaiah 45:18) “The earth abideth for ever.”—Ecclesiastes 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4ZS</sup>The word world means the social and political order or rule governing the people. From Adam to the time of the great deluge was the first world or social order of government, which was under the administration of angels (Piebrews 2:5), and which passed away in a great flood, during which only Noah and his family, consisting in all of eight persons, were carried over from the old to the other or newer world, and were saved. (2 Peter 3:6; 1 Peter 3:20) There began’ with Noah and his family a new order or world, which in the time of the Apostle’s day and before that time had grown evil, and which he designated as “this present evil world.” (Galatians 1:4) The Apostle clearly shows that that world must pass away to make •way for the new and righteous kingdom, which will rule and govern and bless the people. <sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Do we find the clergy of various denominations anxious to tell of the Lord’s second presence ? and if not, why not? [[ 426.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why do these distinguished gentlemen scoff and jeer at those who teach the Lord is now present? [[ 426.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Did the Lord foretell this ? Quote the Apostle’s language with reference to it. [[ 426. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why did the disciples want to know what would be the proof of the Lord’s presence and of the end of the world? [[ 427.</span></p>
