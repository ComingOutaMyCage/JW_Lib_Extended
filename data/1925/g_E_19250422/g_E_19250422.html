<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Automatic Electronic Diagnosis</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. B. A. Gamble, Dean of the Norfolk Electronic Institute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> has fullest confidence In any representations that may be made by Doctor Gamble. He is well </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">known </span><span class="font5">to many of our readers and we are sure they will read this important article with great interest.—Editor.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8"> KNOW that the Golden Age has hitherto held aloof from saying anything, either one way or the other, about the famous Abrams’ Electronic system of detecting and treating diseased conditions; but I feel that the time has now come when it may safely and wisely do so. A new discovery in this field has such promise of being an inestimable boon to mankind that I feel it would be a pity to keep it under cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Perhaps I will be forgiven if I assure the readers of The Golden Age that I am an old-school physician, with twenty-eight years’ actual experience in the practice of regular medicine, the last ten of which have been devoted exclusively to chronic diseases; and that naturally I approach any new theory with the caution that years of experience and habits of close scrutiny are bound to bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Any capable physician will instantly concur with the proposition that the science of medicine, as at present practised, is built up on the diagnosis of diseases by their symptoms and the treatment of those symptoms. In the highly organized and progressive state of Massachusetts it is reliably estimated that nearly forty-five percent of the preliminary diagnoses are afterwards proven to be incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Symptoms are simply the sign posts, nature’s warnings of disease processes already established in the body. When symptoms become so pronounced that attention is repeatedly called to them by fever, pain, fatigue, nervousness, etc., tissue or body changes have taken place; the ‘‘balance” of the system has been upset (I will explain later what I mean by this term “balance”.) and we have a condition of disease, a disturbance of the proper equilibrium of the marvelous organism in which we think and see and hear and smell and taste and talk and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Treating the symptoms, while relieving the pain temporarily, does not relieve the cause of the unbalance; and later there may be established a chronic condition, or its beginning, which seriously impairs the bodily functions so necessary to health, and curtails the activity and the happiness of the individual so affected and of those immediately about him.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Nature Does the Curing</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font8">THING that must always be borne in mind in the treatment of disease is, that it is nature that does the curing. Nature is constantly engaged in the struggle to prevent or subdue sickness in our bodies. What she reasonably asks of her tenant is that he will do the reasonable thing by bringing in materials suitable to the building up of the life cells, and by giving reasonable attention to the elimination of the disease toxins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elimination of the toxins and poisons of the body is accomplished in three ways; through <sup>T</sup>he bowels, the kidneys, and the skin. If any or all of these become impaired from any cause, disease is sure to result. Again, if disease is present in any form, we can be reasonably sure that either one or all of these avenues have become affected and need assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The efforts of the physician are best directed when he seeks a path by which nature can have a proper chance to repair the damage that may have been caused by the disease, the amount </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font8">repair being directly dependent upon the amount of local destruction in the particular organ, tissue and cells involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was an epochal discovery in science and in medicine when the revelations came home to professional men that all substances are to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">greater or less extent broadcasting stations, put-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ting signals on the air which vary as do the assembly and rate of the “electrons” of which they are composed. All of the sensory organs— nose, eyes, ears, mouth, and touch— are receiving sets. Every nerve tract in the body is a receiving set; and hence the medical profession can not possibly ignore radio, even if it would.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was an appreciation of the immense significance of these facts that led me to give attention to the theory of electronic reactions when it was first put before the medical profession some five years ago. As a resume of some of the important findings in this field I quote a few paragraphs from John Mills’ recent book, “Within the Atom”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If v<sup>r</sup>e accept the very latest dictum of the physicists, that all matter is composed of compressed units of electrical energy called ‘electrons’, and that, in the inevitable process of disintegration (the fate of all material things), this energy is set free as ‘radio activity’ or ‘radiant energy’ does it not logically follow, purely as a matter of course, that this kinetic energy could be recognized and measured, if apparatus or methods of sufficient delicacy can be devised?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Just suppose that twenty years ago someone had told you that the very air you were breathing was full of music, crop and weather reports, and so on. You would have thought your informant a fit subject for examination by an alienist. But today you know that such things are facts, because you can place a little electrical apparatus on the table, press a button and hear music, sermons, speeches or reports snatched out of the air. This has been brought about by the improvement in sensitivity of receiving apparatus, which catch the energy being broadcast by the sending station, a thing entirely unthinkable a quarter of a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When the attention of the scientific world becomes focused upon the possibilities of applying the same reasoning to the healing of afflicted people as is applied to a problem in physics, chemistry or astronomy, the realization of the altruist’s dream will be at hand. The recognition of the universality of Nature’s law and its application to all problems, great and small, is the first step in breaking the shackles of unscientific diagnosis and inefficient treatment.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Abrams a Great Discoverer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font8">HEN the description of the X-Ray was first cabled from Europe, the experts on the leading magazine for electrical engineers, published in New York, rushed into print denouncing the whole thing as a fake and an impossibility, and reproved the public for being so foolish, so credulous, as to believe that any </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">device </span><span class="font8">could .ever be made that would enable human beings to see through wood or leather and to take photographs of what lay beneath. Hence none should be disturbed by the bitter denunciations which followed the announcement of the epoch-making discoveries of Dr. Albert Abrams, deceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To Dr. Abrams is due, and will always be due, the credit for setting forth the fundamental truths concerning the Electronic theory in its application to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. His method, as taught and applied, has already created a revolution in the ranks of medicine which only the uninformed and the unprogressive will deny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I was not at all surprised the other day when I noticed despatches from England that a great association of medical men which a year ago unsparingly condemned the Abrams methods had reversed itself and acknowledged that the whole subject should be reexamined. In my view, no other course is possible. They are bound to come to it, sooner or later. The many marvelous cures made by Dr. Abrams, and those who practise the Electronic Reactions of Abrams, or ERA, as it is called, have forced the attention of the whole world upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That Dr. Abrams did make the cures claimed by him I know positively; for I went to San Francisco in 1922, studied with him, and assisted him on many occasions. I daily visited his treatment rooms, filled with people from every part of the world, talked with them, and watched the progress of their eases; and consequently I have first-hand knowledge of these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Like Edison, who had to devise models for his electrical apparatus, Dr. Abrams had to contrive instruments for its application in the treatment of disease, chief and best of which was his oscilloclast. He was engaged for twenty years in experiments in the electronic field, and had made wonderful progress at the time of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not at all to Dr. Abrams’ discredit that his teachers and students are working daily, and are producing better machines since his death. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">idea</span><span class="font8"> is the big thing; and for that Dr. Abrams will never be forgotten, but will eventually get undying fame. The machine or treatment apparatus, however, is the heart of the whole thing, as far as the patient is concerned; and it is to his interest that the Abrams ideas should be carried to their apex.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Electronic Theory Correct</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font8">S A hint of what is coming in this country, as well as in England, among the progressive men that go to make up the medical profession I quote the following despatch taken from the daily press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“MAN A MACHINE, DOCTOR ASSERTS TO CONVENTION—Tells American Surgeons 28 Trillion Wet Batteries Form Body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Chicago, Oct. 23rd. (By Associated Press) Man is simply a mechanism run by electricity and chemical action, a machine made up of twenty-eight trillion electric cells, according to Dr. George W. Crile, Cleveland surgeon, here attending the convention of the American College of Surgeons. Each cell of the body, 28 trillion of them, is a tiny wet battery, with negative and positive poles, according to the surgeon. The brain cells are the most positive. The cells of the liver are the most negative.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Crile is simply stating facts that have been long understood and demonstrated by Dr. Abrams and his co-workers, in the field of Electronics. If the electrical “balance” of the cells is correct, proper nerve supply, nutrition and elimination will follow normally; and good health will follow as a matter of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we can take any body organ tissue that has an unbalance or disturbed equilibrium, and by sending an electronic current of the right potentiality into the diseased tissues, bring the equilibrium back to normal, then the nerve supply, nutrition and elimination can take effect. And if this can be accomplished gradually, nature will step in and finish the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the recent Chicago convention of the American Electronic Research Association Professor Blackburn, of Texas, gave a two-hours’ talk which can be condensed into the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That everything vibrates' or is a broadcasting station is corroborated by the eminent men of science who collaborated in the preparation of the material which composes that great work of reference, The Standard Dictionary. All of these vibrations or radio waves exist and travel indefinitely until they meet their own like or kind of waves, when both unite and cease to exist. Our objective is to collect those peculiar vibrations which are set up in the body by the many various diseases to which humanity is subject, and then to send into the body exact corresponding waves or vibrations. When these introduced waves meet the disease waves in the body, both cease to exist and nature restores the balance. Therefore, gentlemen, if we work out machines or apparatus that assure us of a perfect tuning in, we are masters of all disease.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250422_files/g_E_19250422-2.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Disease is Wrong Vibration</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">BOM what has thus far been said, it will be apparent to all that any disease is simply an “out of tune” condition of some part of the organism. In other words, the affected part of the body “vibrates” higher or lower than normal. It has a different vibratory rate than the rest of the body. It is out of “balance”. It is dis-eased. Diseased tissues radiate more energy than healthy tissues, and this unbalance can be measured and corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Science tells us that when two high radio frequency waves of the same rate meet, they become neutralized; and upon this fact is based the entire principle of treatment by all electronic treatment machines. In other words, when an electro-magnetic wave meets in its path a substance vibrating at the same rate of speed or resonance, that wave is stopped; and the energy is absorbed by the medium that stopped it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is illustrated by the fact that if you toss a stone into a pond, waves will spread from that spot into wider and wider circles. Then toss another stone at another point, and the effect will be the same. However, when these different waves meet, they neutralize or destroy each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So eminent a physician as Sir James Barr, formerly president of the British Medical Association, has given unqualified consent to the principle that by creating a radio vibration similar to that used by a disease in the human body it is possible to cancel or neutralize that disease. The solution of the disease problem lies in the development of scientific instruments that will respond to the delicate vibrations produced, and will adjust the electronic unbalance where it exists.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Diagnosis is the Crux</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dr. Fred Moore says: “Skilled diagnosis is the crux of ERA success.” This is true; and</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250422_files/g_E_19250422-3.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Abrams frequently stated that perhaps not more than ten percent of the students who took the course under his personal supervision would become successful diagnosticians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ideal for which Dr. Abrams was striving, was some method of automatic diagnosis. That this is true is proven by a letter written a short time before his death to his student and very close friend, Dr. Strong of Los Angeles, in which he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You are quite right, Doctor. In the final analysis it is always the man behind the gun who determines the degree of accuracy of the results. Nevertheless, I shall continue to try to eliminate the personal equation from electronic diagnosis in so far as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the two great conventions held by Abrams practitioners during the year 1924, the one for the Middle States Society, held at Kansas City, Mo., and other of the A. E. R. A. in Chicago, attended by ERA men from all over the world, the burden of all the speeches and discussions was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If a better method can be discovered for making diagnoses, a method by which we can tune in automatically, we shall have found the elusive secret of Electronics, and the problem of its proper application in the treatment of diseases will have been solved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is one other feature of the Abrams system that has hindered its wider use in the relief of suffering humanity. The cost of a blood diagnosis, together with the necessary one, two, or possibly three months’ treatment is far beyond the means of the individual or family in average circumstances; and it has been almost impossible for poor people to have the benefit of the Abrams treatment because of the cost factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Up to this time, only doctors could have the apparatus for treatment and diagnosis. In, trying to find a way to lessen this cost, and to insure 100 percent correct diagnosis, I have been fortunate enough to discover a new application of the electronic radio principle, which eliminates both the cost of diagnosis and the possible errors of incompetent ERA practitioners, and brings this whole matter of the treatment of disease by electronic methods within the reach of every family.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Electronic Radio Biola</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8"> HAVE named this new discovery, which I believe will be epochal in the history of the treatment of disease, and which I am exclusively announcing in The Golden Age prior to its general publication elsewhere, The Electronic Radio Biola, which means life renewed by radio waves or electrons. The Biola automatically diagnoses and treats diseases by the use of the electronic vibrations. The diagnosis is 100 percent correct, rendering better service in this respect than the most experienced diagnostician, and without any attending cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This little instrument automatically measures the body energy, its power of resistance to disease and, if disease exists or if the energy of the body is below par, corrects it. This is done by radio vibration, which makes the human body its own dynamizer, or anti-toxin manufacturer. It restores underbalance in diseased tissues, accomplishing the work gradually. The “balance” in the life cells is completely restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The operation of the Biola is such that it discovers and locates disease processes in their very beginning, before great damage has been done, rearranges the electrons and the body equilibrium, and enables nature to restore the organs or parts to normal.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>The Biola Wave Trap</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font8">HE principle of operation of the Biola is the collection, in suitable media (the result of twenty-eight years’ actual experience in the practice of regular medicine) of the disease vibrations, if any, which have become set up in one’s body. The fluid containing the same waves or vibrations enters the body, meets the disease waves and destroys them. The Biola is constructive, the wave trap containing the essential elements needed by the body to recreate and reconstruct the broken-down tissues or cells. This is a great step forward, marking the Biola, as the most valuable treatment apparatus obtainable today, and well worthy of notice in the columns of a magazine like The Golden Age, which looks forward to perfect days ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the operation of the Biola the patient’s body is the motive power; and the vibrations coming from the earth, harnessed to the body, tunes in to every disease, no matter how small or how great, automatically carries them into the Biola, or radio wave trap, where they are registered, measured and held, and can be returned to the patient at will and used to destroy the very disease that produced them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A proof that the Biola must be 100 percent correct in its diagnoses is seen in the fact that an ordinary radio receiving set (comparable to one’s body) is governed by the antenna, which collects from the vibrations coming through the air or through the ground. The antenna, when connected to radio set, and properly tuned, will reproduce a single instrument or an entire or-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">chestra, thus corresponding to a single disease or several diseases from which one may be suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In operation, the Biola is attached to a ground wire, a radiator, from the heating system, or the like, which is in turn attached to the patient’s body. The radio vibrations, carried by the electro magnetic earth currents, automatically vibrate in unison with each and every disease vibration in the body, be they few or many, carrying them into the Biola and storing .them up for use at will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Biola radio wave trap uses water as a medium for catching these disease vibrations; but water being a poor conductor, its conductivity is increased by the addition of the elements heretofore referred to, which not only increase the conductivity, but in addition absorb and hold the vibrations, and also impart to the tissues and organs the medicines or elements nature requires to reconstruct the parts broken down by the disease. Thus the Biola not only provides the Electronic vibrations to -destroy the disease, but at one and the same time furnishes the body with the proper material with which to rebuild itself.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Biola an Automatic Antitoxin</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">O</span><span class="font8">NE of the greatest achievements of modern medicines is the discovery and production of antitoxin for Diphtheria. Formerly ninety percent of the children attacked by the dreadful disease died; but since antitoxin has been used, this has been reversed and now ninety percent who have diphtheria recover. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Antitoxin is produced by inoculating a healthy horse with a small amount of diphtheria disease germs. This produces a light attack of diphtheria in the animal. After he recovers, he is again given a stronger dose of germs; and this is continued until he finally becomes immune to diphtheria, and can have sufficient germs of the disease injected into him to cause the death of an entire regiment of soldiers. Then a vein in his neck is tapped; and a gallon or more of his blood is drawn off, sterilized, properly handled; and a small quantity is injected into the child when it has diphtheria, with the result that a cure is effected promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is identically the method of the electronic radio Biola, with the exception that instead of introducing the dead disease germs into the system, the Biola takes from the body the disease waves (antitoxin) and returns them into the system, where they meet and destroy the conditions that produced them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In conclusion, the Biola is unquestionably a wonderful addition to the science of medicine, some of its greatest advantages being:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. It can be used by the individual himself;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. It can be used singly or in connection with any or all other methods of healing;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. It is constructive from the beginning of the treatment;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. It is so simple in its operation that every one can use it; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5. And, lastly, its price brings it within the reach of every family, even those in the poorest circumstances.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">These things in themselves furnish undoubted evidence that we are entering the Golden Age, so longed for by all of earth’s inhabitants, where each will have his heart’s desire for life, liberty and happiness under perfect conditions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font8"> STORY is told of one of the Sages of the Talmud, Nahum, the man of Gamzu, so named, it is said, because that no matter what misfortune came to his lot, he invariably proclaimed </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gam zu l’tovah.</span><span class="font8"> “This also is for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Once, the story goes, that Rabbi Akiba was driven out of his land and made a wanderer and a fugitive in foreign parts, because of persecution. All he had left was a lamp which he used to light at night in order to study the Law, a cock which served to announce to him the rising dawn, and a beast of burden on which he rode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The sun was slowly sinking in the west, the darkness was beginning to fall, and the poor wayfarer knew not any place of shelter or rest, although he was nearly exhausted. Therefore when he at last saw the lights of a village shining in the distance, he felt glad, and hastened in order to procure for himself a night’s lodging. He was thankful to find it inhabited, when at last he came to the outskirts, and thought of the humanity and compassion that awaited him. But to his disappointment he discovered that he was mistaken. He was refused even a night’s lodging. They compelled him to seek for shelter and rest in a near-by forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is hard, very hard,” said he, “not to find a hospitable roof to protect me against the inclemency of the weather. But God is just, and whatever He does is for the best.” He sat down under a tree, lighted his lamp and began to study the Law. He had hardly read a chapter when a violent storm put out his light. “What!” he exclaimed, “must I not be permitted even to pursue my favorite study? But God is just, and whatever He does is for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Straightening himself at full length on the ground, he sought, if it were possible, to obtain a few hours’ sleep. Hardly had he closed his eyes when a hungry wolf prowled up, leaped upon his cock, and killed the fowl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What new misfortune is this?” cried the surprised Akiba. “My vigilant companion is gone. Who will henceforth awaken me to the study of the Law? But God is just. He knew best what is good for us poor mortals.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hardly had he finished the sentence, when a roaring lion sprang toward his beast and devoured the poor animal. “What is to be done now?” the lonely wanderer asked himself. “My beast and my cock are gone; all is gone. But praised be the Lord, whatever He does is for the best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That night he did not sleep; and at an early morning hour he started to the village, to see whether he could get some beast of burden to help him on in his journey. But what was his surprise not to find a single individual alive! It seems that a band of thieves had entered the village during the night, murdered its inhabitants, and pillaged their houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As soon as Akiba had recovered from the amazement into which this remarkable occurrence had thrown him, he lifted his voice and exclaimed: “Thou great God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, now I know by experience that poor mortal men are short-sighted and blind, often considering as evils what is intended for their preservation. But Thou alone are just and kind and merciful. Had not the hard-hearted people driven me by their inhospitality from the village, I should assuredly have shared their fate! Had not the wind extinguished my lamp, the robbers would have been drawn to the spot, and have murdered me! I perceive, also, that it was Thy mercy which deprived me of my two companions, that they might not by their noise give notice to the robbers of my whereabouts. Praised then be Thy name for ever and ever.”</span></p>

Many a habitue of these places can testify that he learned to shoot pool in the church basement, and was graduated through the Y. M. C. A. to the pool-hall of doubtful reputation. We sincerely hope that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font8"> is right; and that our young manhood is awakening to the need of a cleaner and saner viewpoint, though it is doubtful if checker-board shirts are a good sign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font8"> striking address was recently delivered in Toronto by Miss Agnes McPhail, a member of the Dominion Parliament, who for a long time could not obtain a hall in which to speak, owing to the veto of the “city fathers”, and subsequent fear of the owners of available halls. Her subject, “The School and Peace,” was a striking arraignment of war and war-makers, as well as the war teachers, those whose only idea of patriotism is death and bloody battlefields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As reported by the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font8"> her speech was filled with pungent criticism:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Miss McPhail was grieved to find that the three, great institutions, the school, the church, and the. state, were arrayed against progress and light in this matter. She was in agreement with the English cynic who said that he had only once heard of a bishop who had opposed a war, and that was a war to end slave traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We call ourselves brave, but the only brave thing we do is because of our stupidity. We are stupid because we can’t distinguish between the youth who died and the thing that killed them. Because we honor our dead we honor war, .and so perpetuate the lie.’ She read from a Canadian school history which said: 'The part played by Canada was full of glory.’ 'Glory!’ cried Miss McPhail scornfully. ‘Glory&quot;! Full of bravery, yes. Full of misery, yes. Full of glory, no!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Miss McPhail was a staunch opposer of the vote of $450,000 last session, for cadet training. “I am in favor of large sums for physical development, but not one cent for training that glorifies bloodshed,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Recently the city of Edmonton expended $5,000 for 600 cadet uniforms, money provided by the Department of Militia and Defense for that purpose. A considerable amount of opposition was aroused among the trustees who deprecated the military training now being given in the schools. The director of the cadet work, however, Major Kennedy, explained that no real military training was given to the boys, hence the need of uniforms. The argument is somewhat obscure, but is evidently quite lucid to the editor of the Edmonton </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font8"> which reports the occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The press reports a recent discovery of great interest to dentists and their legion of victims. Research work carried on in the laboratories of the University of Toronto has resulted in the discovery of a copper amalgam filling for the root canals of teeth, which has a permanent germicidal effect. You can now keep your teeth until the righteous law, “Nothing shall hurt nor destroy,’&quot; is permanently in effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord’s Day Alliance, a self-appointed body of clerics,, et ah, dedicated to the work of making life miserable for everybody on Sunday, has just lost its appeal to the Privy Council against the running of Sunday trains in Manitoba to the lake shore, and for the benefit of “week ending” holiday seekers. The Alliance is fearful, according to a Canadian Press cable report of the General Secretary’s statement, that Manitoba is now outside the jurisdiction of the Lord’s Day Act. In other words, the clerk and niechanic can now go and take a swim on Sunday, much to the disgust of those who tacitly sanction the playing of golf and joy-riding by the wealthier sections of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vancouver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font8"> scathingly comments on the action of the British Columbia Premier who “wept as he cast his vote for beer by the glass”. This further issue in the stormy and liquorish life of that Province has arisen over the avowed intention of the brewery interests to bring back a more general sale of strong beer. They have succeeded, and are consequently jubilant. The Government in the meantime weeps because it can not stem the beer flood; and “the Premier admits that he can not face the lobby pressure that a year’s delay would involve”. British Columbia now candidly admits that the last vestige of popular government has faded away, and the “liquor ring” controls the destiny of the Province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ontario voters received a rude shock also, when the Premier, in spite of the large majority vote polled for the retention of the Ontario Temperance Act, brought in, in the recently delivered speech from the throne, amendments to the existing legislation to permit of beer of almost double the present alcoholic content to be sold. Traitor and renegade are among the most polite expressions of a large section of the public, but readers of The Golden Age will remember that your correspondent prophesied a return of booze before last Christmas. He hardly expected, however, to see this prophecy fulfilled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">in spite of</span><span class="font8"> the mandate of the people. Law makers in Canada are rapidly taking the course of law breakers to gain their own ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The world wheat shortage is rapidly bringing a crisis in Canadian wheat circles. Operators are surprised at the smallness of the wheat shipments in view of the high prices recently prevailing and the amount of business turned over, on paper. It is beginning to look as though there was an actual shortage of supplies to fill the large orders being placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Russia, once considered the greatest rival of the Canadian wheat farmers in the European market, is now one of our best customers. In the past few months orders have been placed totaling almost two million barrels of flour, which will utilize about nine million bushels of wheat, and which involve a price of around sixteen million dollars. It means busy flour mills in Canada, but will no doubt also mean higher bread prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Canadian farmer is somewhat cheered at the thought of high prices continuing for a longer period than usual; but, as usual, the speculator and grain operator will garner the cream of the price harvest. Most farmers are so heavily indebted to the various financial corporations that they are not allowed to hold their grain for top price, but must sell on a flooded market at low prices so that the banks and financial corporations can gain their unearned increment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vancouver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font8"> headlines a news item, “Hell Fire in Discard Now”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ 'Dogmas introduced into Christianity during medieval times must be discarded and the Christian creed restated in terms comprehensible by moderns/ stated Rev. Dr. C. H. Shortt, warden of the Anglican Theological College. 'Few people today believe in an everlasting hell fire for mankind.’ 'Consciousness of son-ship in God through Jesus Christ/ was his definition of Christianity. 'As men increased in their capacity for understanding, it was possible to make a fuller and perhaps a full revelation of God in Christ.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A few more candid utterances of this kind by responsible representatives of the denominational churches; and the first thing we know they will be preaching the true gospel of the kingdom and the times of restitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pursuant to the policy of keeping the people of Canada advised of her financial standing as stated through the most authoritative channels, we publish a review of the Government financial statement as issued by the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Monetary Times</span><span class="font8"> of January 16th, 1925:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“FURTHER INCREASE IN CANADA’S NET DEBT.—December Reports Show Six Million Advance In Net Debt.—Also Higher Than Last Year.—Gross Debt and Active Assets Decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Another advance in the net debt of the Dominion of Canada was recorded during the month of December; the net debt at the end. of the month being six million higher than the previous month, and two million in advance of December, 1923. This compares with an increase of $896,676 in the net debt during December, 1923. On the other hand, there was a decline of' fifty-one million in the gross debt during December, and active assets were also lower by fifty-six million in comparison with November. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“December revenue, which totaled $23,709,196, was two million lower than the November results, and five million below the December, 1923, total. For the nine moiiths ending December 31, total revenue fell off by forty-four million in comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There was a considerable decrease in the December expenditures in comparison with November. December expenditures, which totaled $28,539,470, are fifty percent lower than the November expenditures. For the nine months’ period the expenditures are down by two million.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the January 30th issue of the same journal is a special article calling attention to the Taxation problem of the Dominion Government. Under the heading, “Tax Reduction Arguments Deceived Government,” the following statements are made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In so far as taxation is concerned, it may be taken for granted that there will be few experiments as long as business conditions remain depressed. . . . Last year the Government reduced taxation in the sales tax by $24,000,000 hoping that increased business would make up for the decrease, but our expectations will not be realized. . . . The indications are that on the whole fiscal year revenue will be down between $55,000,000 and $60,000,000.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In its issue of January 16th, reporting the meeting of shareholders of the Union Bank of Canada in Winnipeg, it quotes from the address of Mr. W. R. Allan, President:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Taxation in Canada requires anxious thought. Federal and municipal taxes with, in some cases, provincial additions, have become so onerous as to stifle business and discourage effort. The total taxes paid by this bank in the past year amounted to $441,497.77.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Saskatoon </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Phoenix</span><span class="font8"> joins in the chorus with an editorial comment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In round numbers the expenditures of the Dominion of Canada for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 1925, will be $400,000,000. Of this sum about $134,000,000 is needed to pay interest on the public debt. Approximately $58,000,000 is included under the head ‘railways and canals chargeable' to income’, most of the money going to the Canadian National Railway in the form of loans. Soldiers’ pensions for the year, $33,000,000, while Soldiers’ Settlement and Re-establishment will consume about $16,000,000 more. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To pay debt charges, to maintain the Canadian National Railways, and to look after returned soldiers takes sixty percent of the revenue collected from Canadian tax payers. . . . Canadians can not hope for spectacular tax reductions in the near future.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">income tax rate has been cut 25% with only a 15% decrease in receipts resulting. Canada has experienced a 31% decrease in Federal income tax receipts in the same period—with no decrease in rate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The answer seems to be quite obvious. Canada is not prosperous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Family lieraid &amp;&nbsp;Weekly Star</span><span class="font8"> publishes the Dominion Bureau of Statistics report on employment, showing that in January 5,813 employers decreased their payrolls by 57,227 persons :</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Moose Jaw </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Times,</span><span class="font8"> featuring an article from the pen of Hon. David Lloyd George, former British Prime Minister, brings to light that statesman’s viewpoint on world conditions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Afterwar Crusade to Improve World Conditions Has Now Collapsed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The deepest impression left on my mind by 1924 is of a world once more reconciled to black. The iridescent colors of a new hope flung on the sky by the Great War after becoming year by year fainter and more mildewed with the unfavorable weather that followed peace, seem finally to have faded away altogether during this year, and a dull grey hangsi over the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Strikes multiplied beyond all previous records. During the years that followed peace the number of days lost in industrial strife was double and treble what it was before the war. . . . For the time being, disillusionment is the prevalent feeling amongst the idealists of all classes and in all lands. There is a temporary collapse everywhere of the desire to struggle upward. . . . This mood will not last long.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We hope not; for this is largely the state of mind of Canada, in common with Europe. The weight of circumstances is crushing the life and hope out of the people. Political appeals to “remember our great heritage”, and so forth, arouse no interest among the mass of a people thoroughly convinced that any “heritage” there may be is not the people’s, but the exploiting capitalist’s. However, the closer to the extremity of our patience we get, the closer also to the bountiful mercy of a God who cares.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>What About Card Playing?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font8">HAT attitude should we, who have turned our faces toward the New Day, take toward the pastime of card-playing? Of course we ourselves want no such pastime; for time does not hang heavily on our minds. The unlimited storehouse of knowledge opened before us, and the wonderful privilege of assisting others into this storehouse fills our time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what about our children? Should we encourage or discourage card-playing among them ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I had the not</span><span class="font8"> uncommon experience of having one parent of each kind—one mindful of spiritual interests, the other dead to these. My mother, who aimed to get away from the control of the “prince of this world”, advised against card-playing and would not permit it in our home. She said that it had some connection with the devil, but could not explain just how. Father laughed at this, and said that her idea was narrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the children accepted Mother’s view, and some chose Father’s as they grew up. I took Mother’s view, and was never found in company with card-players. Neither do I want my children to develop an interest in cards. Of course I am considered “narrow”. Card-playing is foremost on the list of entertainments in this section. Church people and even religious people sit around the card table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One day I went to the library to look up the history of cards, and found that they are of ancient, eastern, pagan origin. There is no mention of them in connection with the Jews, while in God’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cards appeared in Europe at the end of the 14th century for the amusement of the kings at first. The French clergy took to them greatly till forbidden by a synod in 1404.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. Theo. Hoben</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pictures on the cards have been changed often, from kings and queens to popish plots and, after the French Revolution, to republican reminders as Washington, Adams, Franklin, La Fayette, and Indian chiefs, and back to kings and queens again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Great sums of money are spent each year to make the cards, and much more money is spent to buy they, in spite of hard times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many a fortune has been ruined by means of cards and many a heart broken. We have heard of card enthusiasm that amounts to lunacy. From the Nordic countries come stories of such prolonged card-playing as brought forth the scarlet-clothed, horn-headed, long-tailed Old Scratch himself from beneath the chairs of the players.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many times the law has tried with its strong hand to put down this pastime, but then it would be indulged in secretly. Today this amusement is so enchanting that mothers forget their home duties, and fathers their debts, to spend time, energy, and money at the fashionable card-party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And the result?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it a greater intelligence, a thirst for true knowledge and increased sense of duty, a greater desire for right, more love for your fellow man? Is there one good point in favor of this amusement ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With these facts—and many others—before us, it seems that the vari-colored card is akin to occultism and should be shunned even as the ouija board and the seance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">IKE Italy, Germany was making tremendous progress toward cooperation, but the necessities of the case have compelled the government to levy such heavy taxes on all available sources of revenue that the movement has been greatly handicapped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the war the cooperatives had millions of dollars in reserves, but through inflation of the currency and by means of taxation these have been much reduced or have vanished. And yet, with all these obstacles in the way, Germany reported an increase of 2,406 cooperative societies during the one year of 1922. It is estimated that one-fourth of the homes of Germany are attached to the cooperative movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What people can do in the way of cooperation when they are forced to it, was illustrated in Austria, during the last two or three years, where thousands of comfortable homes were built at an average cost of $1,200 for a fiveroom house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The way in which this was done was as follows : The Cooperative Society advanced funds or labor to the amount of 30 percent of the project. The home-builder contributed a certain amount each month in money and a total of 2,000 hours of work in spare time, Saturday afternoons and holidays. In addition, the municipality advanced loans at five percent to aid in the purchase of materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cooperation is spreading in Jugoslavia, and in Hungary it is estimated that almost half the people are served cooperatively. In the latter country tliQ state takes an active interest in the movement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In Russia there are 16,667 agricultural cooperative societies, representing two and one-half million farms. In Russia, cooperation is only twenty-five years old, but it may well be considered the backbone of the entire business structure. It is the one thing that came out of the war stronger than it &quot;went in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Moscow the Central Cooperative operates bakeries, restaurants, and stores of all kinds, libraries, schools, and homes for the children of its employes. Outside the city it has seventy-three big farms, which supply its members with all the necessities and comforts which can be produced by up-to-date agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Palestine, next to Denmark and Switzerland, is setting a world pace in cooperation. The basic idea of the Jewish commonwealth is cooperation. Even the roads are built cooperatively.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">When highways or railroads are to be built they are divided into sections, the proper cost of each section is carefully estimated, and the option of doing that section is offered to a party of men. If they accept the offer they become the contractors for that section, and as they do all the work they receive all the pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The men divide the money among themselves in accordance with the time worked. They have the power to vote any man out of the company who does not play fair. The materials of construction are provided by the government at cost. This is substantially the system employed in Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Australia has made such progress with cooperation that it is estimated that one-fifth of all families in the commonwealth participate. There is a great cooperative bank, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which has conferred benefits upon the Australian people greater than can be expressed in figures. There is at Adelaide, South Australia, a cooperative society which does a business of about $2,000,000 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Africa there is some development along cooperative lines, one of which is a cooperative store at Damietta, Egypt, which has been in operation for five years. In South Africa the government has been trying, with some success, to persuade the farmers to adopt the cooperative methods which have been used so successfully in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cooperation is spreading in Argentina. In Brazil the government offered a subsidy and free transportation to encourage the formation of cooperative societies. There are 309 cooperative colonies among the Brazilian fishermen alone.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Potassium—The Elixir</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8">N A superstitious age of the past men sought for a fabled fountain of youth, whose waters would banish age and decay. Later, as it became evident that no such fountain existed, attention was turned to the cltemical field in the hope that a magic elixir would ultimately be found that would unharness age from the human frame. No doubt these delusive ideas owed their inception to the testimony of the Scriptures that death and old age would not forever curse the race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is, indeed, a fountain of life in near preparation for mankind; and when it is ready, all who will may drink of its waters freely. In connection with it, and as a part of it, there is also an “elixir of youth”. In a former article we identified this as potassium, one of the fifteen chemical elements of which the human body is composed. During the ages past the human system has experienced a shortage of this element which, together with other abnormal influences, has held the race in bondage to decay and death. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is radically impossible for a hurtful excess of potassium to be assimilated into the system. The question is how to get enough of it in sufficient quantities, even for perfect health. Most people suffer a woeful lack of this element in their systems, usually combined also with other elementary deficiencies, thereby producing a proneness to disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we strip cogs from a machine gear, the machine will not operate right; and if we take away one of these gears entirely, the machine will not operate at all. And so it is with the human body; for if any vital food element is insufficiently supplied diseased conditions will finally set up in the system, and if one of these is entirely withheld, then death will speedily ensue when the supply in the system is exhausted. The average diet of most people is very short in practically half of the necessary elements for the sustaining of the human body, and the wonder is that even a semblance of health persists </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font8">all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, the food used may be rich in every needed element, and yet the system may suffer impoverishment through the lack of some of the most vital of these. This is due to the fact that in a large percentage of the foods these elements are in an inert form unavailable for assimilation without a solvent combination. Thus a knowledge of food solvents is a necessary part of health instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most foods contain potassium in its inert form, which is largely unavailable for assimilation unless combined with its solvent principle. Only in acid fruits is potassium found in its free form; but these fruits are in themselves an insufficient source of supply, so that it must be made up from its inert storage in other foods. Happily, fruit acids are the solvent principle of inert potassium; but, for the proper results, these fruits must be eaten in connection with the inert supply. Fruits eaten on an empty stomach will not act as a solvent for the next meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only is potassium in combination with magnesium the chief support of the neutralization and excretion of poison wastes, but these elements are also the chief factors in the building of the soft tissues. It is potassium that preserves the softness and pliancy of these tissues through its cleansing and solvent principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A radical lack of this element in the system is productive of digestive disorders, colds, hardening of the arteries, etc. When this lack is combined with an excessive use of table salt, the foundation is laid for piles and cancer. Common colds are a sure index of potassium lack; for they cannot occur unless this lack exists, if the diet otherwise is normally balanced. Colds are produced by a condition of accumulated poisonous wastes in the system. While exposure will precipitate a cold where the foundation exists, it is not the cause, as is generally supposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Poison wastes in the system are the foundation of all germ disease. It is in this waste that all disease germs breed. Internal and external cleanliness is a sure immunity from every form of germ disease. We might also fitly add, from all disease of whatever character, as this reducing of the body wastes to the minimum, in which they can be excreted as fast as produced, can be done only through a scientifically balanced diet which in itself insures freedom from disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With such a diet, under otherwise normal living conditions, there does not appear to be a shadow of doubt but that with an abundance of free potassium in the system age-hardening can not take place. The very fineness of the human organism, which in this respect is far removed from the very highest orders of the lower animal creation, seems positively to guarantee this. That some will be skeptical on this point is to be expected, as many are unable to consider seriously an undemonstrated theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the consideration of this question, it must be remembered that the dietetic conditions herein outlined are of a character entirely foreign to the habits of practically every individual of the race. Not only is our most important dietetic knowledge very new, but many of the old accepted health theories have been proved to be not only erroneous, but in some points decidedly harmful. For instance, limited and restricted diets; selection of foods of quick and easy digestion; tabooing water with meals or near meal time; special high protein diets; fasting for health; and a long list of other preconceived-ideas of more or less dietetic importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not only important to- know just what to eat, but also the proper combinations in which the various foods should be eaten in order to get the benefit of their-full food values. Some foods of merit are condemned by many because ignorant of their proper use. Thus the banana, which in some points is among the most meritorious of the sweet fruits, has many enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If bananas are eaten with the meals in connection with any of the cereal foods, they will not distress the most sensitive digestive organism; but eaten alone on an empty stomach, especially when one is hungry, they will often cause trouble. Nor are they the only food with this digestive peculiarity. The prejudice against them because they are cut green for market has no foundation in respect to food value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The potential poisons, which most foods contain, have an office to perform. While possibly all their functions may not be known, yet in one point they seem indispensible. This is in influencing toward a variety in the diet. We all have many times had the experience that a food, once keenly relished, finally loses its attractiveness to the appetite, sometimes even to repugnance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the<sup>!</sup> result of the influence of the natural poisons which the food contains, causing the system to rebel against its overuse. But for these poisons, no food would lose its relish; and the natural disposition would be to confine one’s diet to a fe\$ simple articles of the most easily obtained foods, to the exclusion of most others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A wide variety in food is essential to a perfect assimilation, and a perfect state of health can not be built up or maintained without it. Food must also be relished in order to be properly assimilated. If such a variety is maintained in a balanced order, the potential poisons will be neutralized and passed out of the system without harm, and foods will not lose their relish. When a food begins to do this, very evidently it is being used to excess, and its poisons are not being fully neutralized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another indispensible office of food poisons is in the maintaining of the sense of food balance. Such a balance can never be successfully' maintained by weight and measure. Therefore by nature we have been endowed with this sense of food balance as a guide in food selection in both kind and amount. With most people this sense has been stifled through the use of flesh foods, stimulating and drug foods, and other abnormalities in diet. It can be restored again by any who are willing to right-about-face in dietetic habits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In later times a long line of dissipating habits have been contracted, to which all in some measure have been in bondage in at least some feature. Chief among these are the tobacco, tea, coffee,, and refined food habits. These are the leading dissipations in the sense of being the most general, not that they are the worst in physical effect. They are all load enough, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But why throw stones at the whiskey sot and opiate drug fiend while living ourselves in glass houses? Is dissipated appetite any worse in the one case than in the other? Little wonder the race is fast losing both reason and physical vigor!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tea</span><span class="font8"> and coffee exercise a hardening effect upon the tissues of the body, thereby preventing a free elimination of waste. Their habitual use also weakens the nervous system with a corresponding weakening of the powers of endurance. Resistance to disease is lessened, and there appears to be but little question that the mental functions are also in a measure impaired by their use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The use of a stimulant in a time of unusual and excessive physical strain will temporily increase endurance; but its habitual use has a reverse effect. This, however, to the user is delusive; for he feels weak and physically the worse when not under its influence. Tea and coffee are only stimulating drugs without any food value, and their stimulating effects are produced through a mild irritation of the nerve centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The food elements most generally used to excess are the starches, proteins and high carbon foods. A discarding of refined foods is a radical start towards the correction of the diet in these respects. Refined sugars, margarins, animal fats, and refined vegetable oil products are heat producers only, and have no value as tissue builders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Raw sugars are rich in iron, calcium and potassium, three very necessary elements in the up-keep of the human body. Butter and cream are richest in fluorine of any known food products; and there is no element of more consequence to health than fluorine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Butter and cream may well take the place of other shortening products. Animal fats clog up the system with excess wastes. This is especially true of pork and lard. The effort in food selection should be to keep the wastes of the body down to a minimum. The softer and more pliant the tissues are kept, the freer will be the elimination of body wastes. This is a matter of great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Flabby flesh may feel soft to the touch; but in reality it is leathery, lacking spring and elasticity. The elastic buoyancy of the tissues can not be preserved under the tanning influence of tea and coffee. With every necessary element supplied in a normal balance in a diet insuring a wealth of free potassium to the system, why should one grow old ?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>The Umatilla Irrigation Project </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Alice Clinesmith</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8">N THE beginning “the earth was without form and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.” Thus the land comprising the Umatilla Irrigation Project was a vast desert,. and lizards and rattlesnakes moved on the burning sand. From the hilltops, look in whatever direction you would, the view was ever the same—miles and miles of barren sand, covered in spots with sagebrush, a sprinkling of bunchgrass here and there, and a generous supply of cactus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other forms of life were few in number, all of that color which characterizes the creatures of the desert, a dull gray, and very lively and quick of motion, lest they be devoured by their hungry companions in that never ending search for food. Scarcely a sound could be heard— perhaps at night a lone coyote howling at the moon or barking to his fellow comrades; but in the daytime, only the weak chirp of two or three small feathered creatures that had escaped the clutches of that enemy of all bird life, the great black buzzard, of which they were constantly in fear. Jack-rabbits were there in large numbers, and could be seen galloping across the hills, or sitting exhausted in the shade of the large sagebrush. The rays of the burning sun beat down mercilessly on these poor, panting creatures, while rain seldom quenched their thirst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While this still, intensely oppressive heat remained during the Summer months, with the approach of Winter a change came over the scene. Not only was it a change from the scorching sunshine, though the Winter temperature was surely cool enough to compensate for the heat of Summer, but also a change from the drought that had prevailed. Thus for a short space of time the desert aspect of the land became less noticeable, as it lay wrapped in a white blanket of snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Into this great, sandy region with hot dry summers and cold, damp winters, came in the year of 1904 a little band of hardy pioneers. These early settlers had many of the characteristics of those daring pioneers who crossed the great plains in the historic year of ’49. They were a hardy people, brave and bold, possessed of a goodly supply of grit, with the will to do and the courage to dare. They came to conquer, determined to subdue the wild region, and to make of it in a few short years a place enjoyable and profitable for the habitation of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With this worthy purpose in mind, a great irrigation system was carefully planned and approved by the United States Reclamation Service. This irrigation system was a great undertaking, but those who engaged in the work felt confident that it would be a great success. They could see, in their prophetic imagination, the time in future years when the Project, which includes 36,000 acres of land, would be a great and beautiful garden, with trees, flowers and grass on every hand. To be sure, there were at the beginning of the work a number of desirable features on the Project. With the Oregon-Washington Railway and Navigation Railroad running through the western part, the beautiful Columbia river gliding like a silvery ribbon to the ocean and affording navigation to Portland and Astoria, and the Umatilla river, from which the water was to be taken,' the carrying on of the work was made possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The plan of the proposed irrigation system was to take the water from the Umatilla river, above the present site of Echo, carry it through a feed-canal twenty-four and one-half miles, and store it in a great reservoir. From the reservoir it was to be conveyed through a system of canals and laterals to the various farm units, where it would be gladly received by the thirsty land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Work was commenced on the irrigation system in 1906. The building of the reservoir was one of the greatest tasks of the entire system. This great undertaking required not only a long period of time and much capital, but also an enormous amount of labor and supplies. To carry supplies to the site a branch line, about six miles long, was built from the Oregon-Washington Railway and Navigation Railroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At last the work was completed. The land was divided into twenty-acre and forty-acre units; and the irrigation system commenced operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this was the work of years, during which time those first early settlers, and others who had moved in, were often tempted to give up in despair. Living conditions had been almost unbearable. Without a tree to shelter one from the scorching Summer sunshine, with Winter cold enough to freeze one’s finger-tips through the warmest of gloves, and worse yet, with duststorms so great that it seemed at times as if there would be no earth left if the wind ever stopped—with all these undesirable conditions, and many more, how could they live? Or how could anyone make life worth living under such conditions? Some did move away; but others remained, endured, and suffered hardships all those years, because they could see brighter prospects for the future. They lived daily in hope and faith that the future would bring forth their heart’s desire—prosperity and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And they shall not be disappointed. Now, only a few years after the completion of the irrigation system, let us look about and behold, no more a barren waste of sagebrush inhabited by coyotes, but on every hand prosperous farms, green alfalfa meadows, tall waving trees, and happy homes. Four towns have grown up on the Project; namely, Hermiston, Umatilla, Irrigon, and Boardman. Hermiston, which is the largest, and in which are located the Project headquarters, has a population of 660 inhabitants. It is a very prosperous little town, having nearly every kind of business enterprise, as well as a good school and high-school system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Columbia Highway is easily accessible, being connected by other roads with all parts of the Project, and makes motoring to outside places a pleasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the produce of the farms themselves, many crops can be profitably raised. Alfalfa is the principal crop; but small fruits, berries, corn, potatoes and garden truck do well if properly managed. Dairying is carried on quite extensively, and bees and poultry are kept to advantage on many farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A farm experiment station is operated on the Project to determine what crops are most profitable and best adapted to the locality, and to instruct new-comers concerning the methods of irrigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">* # *</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And from the present let us again look forward, not in imagination, but according to the words of all the holy prophets since the world began, and behold the dawning of a new and glorious age, for which this irrigation system is but a small part of the preparation, when Christ shall rule the nations, and all will serve and obey Him. Then will the Umatilla Irrigation Project be complete, and the hopes of the people realized to the fullest extent; for then, indeed, shall the “desert rejoice and blossom as the rose”. ■—Isaiah 35:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then will everyone love his neighbor as himself, and work for the best interests of all. And all the loved ones in death shall come again from the land of the enemy. They shall return to their homes, and their dear ones who have prepared for their coming; and all who will obey the righteous laws of that new age will walk up the highway of holiness, which leads unto everlasting life. “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and-under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”—Micah 4: 3, 4.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>The Lost Art of Hardening Copper Rediscovered</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font8">HREE thousand years ago the Egyptians knew how to harden copper so that the metal could be used for weapons, knives or other instruments that require a keen cutting edge. Then for nearly that length of time the art was lost. Now there are persistent reports that it has been rediscovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There have been many previous reports that the art of hardening copper had been rediscovered, but there must have been something wrong about the process; for after a time they died out, and no hardened copper utensils have ever appeared in modern markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, however, there are so many and so persistent reports that the lost art has been found that we give the data at hand for what they are worth. It surely seems that some of these stories must be true, perhaps all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Canadian “Blacksmith and Woodworker” reports that Arthur Ross, a blacksmith at 40 Main Street, St. John, New Brunswick, claims to be able to harden either copper or aluminum to any degree of hardness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The St. John </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Times-Star</span><span class="font8"> says of Mr. Ross that he produced a pocket-knife the copper blade of which cut through leather like a razor and shaved hardwood better than a new steel knife. He produced a copper chisel with which he cut directly across the grain of oak wood without damaging the edge of the chisel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, Mr. Ross exhibited a pocket knife the blade of which was of aluminum. With this aluminum blade he cut through a stick of wood without turning the edge. Again, he made a wedge two inches long, five-eighths of an inch wide and a quarter of an inch thick, also of aluminum, which he drove deeply into a block of hard wood without affecting the edge of the wedge in the least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the uses to which hardened copper could be put are marine boilers, in which instance salt water from the sea could be utilized direct from the sea without causing injury to the metal; and screens for pulp mills, which now last but a little time, and require to be replaced constantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The hard aluminum would be excellent material for knives , forks, spoons and other household utensils; and Mr. Ross hopes to see it widely used for aeroplanes, automobiles and horseshoes. His discoveries include a method of soldering aluminum. The despatches regarding the discoveries of Mr. Ross are of April date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next place where the process of hardening copper seems to have been discovered was East St. Louis, Ill. There, in June, according to the East St. Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Journal,</span><span class="font8"> Earl Cummings, of 4009 Monroe Avenue, in repairing his automobile accidently discovered that in using some chemicals to clean his copper gaskets he had stumbled upon the secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Cummings was invited to the offices of the Anaconda Copper company, Detroit, to give demonstrations. They were completely satisfactory to the company; and he received a check for $1,000,000, besides a royalty on every 100 pounds of copper treated by his process. This was in July. A fellow worker, Guy Hueter, 4018 Donovan Avenue, helped finance Cummings’ patent, and is now independently wealthy as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The third place from which the rediscovery of the process was reported is Laporte, Indiana. Chicago despatches report that Walter Bunton, a machinist of that place, was offered $2,000,000 and a royalty of four cents per pound by Winthrop, Smith &amp;&nbsp;Co., of New York, if, as he claims, he has discovered a method.of hardening copper so that it cannot be cut by the best steel saws, files and chisels. The Laporte discoveries bear an August date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If coming events cast their shadows before, it would at least seem, from the appearance of the foregoing, that we are at the dawn of a great discovery which will have immense importance in the mechanical arts.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Moving West</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">R</span><span class="font8">EADING an old book on Constantinople and the Eastern or Greek Church, I found this striking quotation from the writings of the late Dean Stanley:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Eastern Christianity must be treated as a temporary halting-place of the great spiritual migration which, from the day that Abraham turned his face away from the rising sun, has been steadily stepping westward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Westward hasi been the trend of empire, and westward has been the trend of spiritual movements of improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abraham lived in the midst of heathenism, when God called him to go west unto the land of Canaan. So here the representative of spiritual progress, and the recipient of a divine promise to bless all the nations of their earth in his seed, was found west of the cradle of humanity. Centuries later we find the sons of Abraham going west along the coast of the Mediterranean sea and to the northwestern limits of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By D. C. Thomas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Asia and into Eastern Europe to spread divine truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Progress never moved from here for a long time. He tried to move, but Satan would not let him. He tried to do some cleaning, with the help of one brother of the name of Arius; and the particular furniture of Satan’s factory they tried to move is called “Trinity”, or the doctrine of a Triune God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But this piece was nailed to the floor; they failed to move it. It is there yet, and Satan and his coworkers managed to throw Arius and Progress out of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During centuries to follow, the house accumulated dirt in heaps. The keepers of the house would not clean it themselves, nor allow anyone else to do so. Satan surely carried an immense amount of mud into the house this time; and Progress was restrained with the help of one agent of the beast and his descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next Spiritual Progress (for that is his full name) moved; and further west he found some good fellow workers in France and Germany, by the names of Waldo and Luther. The last of these was a strong man, and helped Progress to lift some furniture out. Between them they greatly disfigured two pieces of Satan’s furniture; namely, “commercial absolution” and “penance”. These they replaced with divinely-made goods called “justification by faith”. But disfigured as these are, the keepers gathered the pieces; and they have these pieces yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But Progress was not satisfied that enough was being done. So he moved to the extreme western part of Europe, and began sweeping in the British Isles. Here he stayed long, accomplished much and found many faithful workers who swept a great deal of ceremonial cobweb from the minds of the people, and decorated the house with many fine samples of spiritual religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But here was that same old furniture that Progress had never managed to throw out; and it is here yet—“state control”. It really seems that they will never put this into a museum as a relic of the past; but they still keep it in active service. I understand that the Scotch broke an arm off and that the Welsh broke another. But it stands on its legs yet in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This thing bothered Progress a great deal, so one fine day he took a boat and sailed from England for the far west again. Afterwards some tried to bring this old relic into this western country, but it was broken up so badly that they never gave it much room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the old furniture of the factory of the dark ages found room here, however; and Progress has been busy here in the west clearing it out. Progress tramped the wilderness cold, hungry and wet in the person of Roger Williams, and found hospitality among those Red Men that had never heard the name of Christ. Here this furniture, hoary with age, was broken so badly that so far they have not deemed it worth while to give it much room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again we find Progress going west, stepping over the Allegheny mountains. Landing in a smoky city, he began sweeping the house in a little office where he made a new broom and caused much dust to fly with it. Progress found a good hand here by the name of Russell who proved to be a mighty wielder of the theological broom. He not only swept the place, but replaced the old furniture made in Satan’s factory, with new and old pieces with the stamp of S. P. (Scripture Proof) on everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the keepers became furious when they saw him throwing out the old furniture so recklessly. Still he did not stop, in spite of their opposition, but went on through the whole house with the light of God in his hand to see what furniture was in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He found rotten old dogmas, which he threw out. Another piece called natural immortality of the soul was found that was never made in the inspired factory. He condemned it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another called eternal torture he flung out because it did not bear the 0. K. of divine truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the sacerdotal rooms of the house he found many trinkets that the Great Master of the house had condemned. Here in the linen department he found long vestments, some collars made to button in the back, and some spurious worthless imitations of jewelry, stamped Rev. and D. D. etc., all intended to segregate and rank some disciples of Christ above the others. They were spurious because the Master says: “Ail ye are brethren.” Under the inspection of the glass (Matthew 23:7-10) they were all found to be spurious and artificial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This stuff had been brought in by one who called herself “Mother” in the house. But because they were not genuine goods, they all went out at the ruthless hand of this honest worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When this noble worker was growing old, it was found that he had made seven brooms to help his fellow workers to keep on cleaning up. These new brooms have been duplicated and scattered still further west; and now there is a mighty host of them sweeping the dust of error away. Creeds and dogmas, ceremonies and titles are being flung into the face of the devil, who made them. Satan now is furious because his pet doctrines are handled so irreverently; and here he says: “That fine old piece of dogma I made long ago in the garden of Eden; and lately I had some friends like Sir Oliver Lodge and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to paint it up and burnish it. It looks very attractive now to many people. But these reckless reformers of the western world have no respect for anything that is not strictly Biblical. They will not have anything that I have made.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The biggest cleaning that Progress ever made was in this far west. So far Progress has been trying to clean the King’s house where His Bride has lived till now. Next in order will be the cleaning of the world at large.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">P</span><span class="font8">ALESTINE, ancient land of the Bible, is being rebuilt. Biblical prophecy is being fulfilled in the reinstatement of modern Israel in the Holy Land. The age-old prayer of a dispersed and harassed people has been answered by a tribunal of all the nations which has guaranteed to the Jews the right to build up for themselves a National Home in Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the past thirty-five years the work of rehabilitating the ancient Homeland, which has been despoiled and denuded by centuries of Turkish and Arabian misrule and neglect, has been going forward with increasing intensity; and the process has been especially intense since the Armistice. The Jewish people, scattered throughout the world, are reconstructing the country, rebuilding the land brick for brick, stone for stone. Swamps have been drained, sandy wastelands have been made fertile, smiling villages are springing up all over the Homeland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American Jew has made possible in no small measure the reconstruction activity in Palestine. He has given his time in tireless effort to achieve the object for which Jews for so many centuries have hoped and prayed and striven; he has given of his material possessions to make the achievement possible. Thousands of Jews in America have labored unceasingly and still labor for an ideal which they never find too difficult to visualize, although its realization is taking place over five thousand miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Jewish Homeland, with no system of government subvention or taxation to finance regular government functions, is being rebuilt by the Jews of the world. The chief instrument for the financing of the rehabilitation of the Homeland is the Palestine Foundation Fund. It is in this fund that the Jews of America are the greatest participants. Until very recently fully sixty-five percent of the cost of reclaiming the land was borne by the Jews of America. The latest figures place American participation at less than sixty percent. This does not mean that Americans are giving less— in fact they are giving more than ever—but that European Jews are slowly recovering from the shambles of a horrible war, and are beginning to assume their share of the burden of reconstruction. The task of rehabilitating Palestine had its beginnings in a movement begun by an organization which termed itself “Lovers of Zion” during the last century. But their accomplishments were limited by the unfriendliness of the Turks and a lack of large means. Since the War, or since the Armistice, work in Palestine has been going forward on a scale that has been limited only by the amount of funds available for the task. Since the pronouncement of the Balfour Declaration and the ratification by the League of Nations of the British mandatory power over Palestine, we have been, as a Jewish Agency, instrumental in conducting several important operations in Palestine. The primary one was immigration; and in the last three and a half years, 35,000 immigrants have entered the country. These are men and women ranging in age from eighteen to thirty-five or forty. Most of the men have gone through the war, and most of them have prepared themselves for going to Palestine. They are the pioneers, men who represent what is left of good families, people of good education in most cases. It is noteworthy that in the first years of our immigration, about forty percent of the people were men and women with university training, the great majority of them physically fit to perform the most difficult work connected with the upbuilding of a derelict country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I think it is correct to say that if there were today free movement along the roads of Europe, and that if these roads were not barricaded by guns, passports, visas, police and contending armies, there would have been a stream of such people seeking the road to the next port where they might find a ship which would carry them to Palestine. Of the people who enter Palestine, about twenty-five to thirty percent are being absorbed in agriculture. About fifty percent are being absorbed in temporary occupations, building of houses, draining of marshes, planting of forests, etc. The rest is being absorbed in trade, commerce and the liberal professions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is room in Palestine for at least a million and a half people over and above the present population of the country. Palestine of old, within the boundaries of the present Mandate under Great Britain, had a population of about two millions. It is obvious that with modern methods of development a far greater number could be settled without in the slightest degree interfering with the legitimate interests of the present population in Palestine. In three and a half difficult years of working in Palestine we have, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, not given the slightest cause for complaint to any of the interests which are involved in Palestine. And I sincerely hope and trust that it will be given to us to continue the work in the same spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The thirty-five thousand immigrants absorbed in the way I have described have formed the nucleus of our work; and we have, along with absorbing them, built up gradually the beginning of a community and a life in Palestine which I venture to say may be considered a creditable achievement. We have built roads, we have drained marshes, we have improved considerably the sanitary state of the country; and many places which four or five years ago were considered a waste and a reproach to the country are covered by small but prospering villages. We have established and are maintaining through the Palestine Foundation Fund a system of education which I think is to be compared favorably with any system of European or American education. The school system is complete, from the kindergarten to the University; and it is an interesting commentary that the language of instruction is entirely Hebrew. The ancient Biblical tongue has been revived as a living language. We have enabled Palestine to recover quickly from the effects of the war, and I think we can see the foundation of the National Home gradually emerging. The blight which has been cast on Palestine by Turkish rule is gradually disappearing, owing to Jewish endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is being created in Palestine today is not merely a refuge for the thousands who will come or are coming in. It is a refuge for the martyred Jewish soul which floats between heaven and earth, which has been floating for thousands of years without finding a resting place, but which is beginning to find its rest on the soil of Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Biblical prophecy predicts that “the word of the Lord will go out from Jerusalem”. This prophecy is destined for fulfilment. The world has at last heeded the prayers and suffering, the protests, and the pleas for justice to the Jew. It needed a great upheaval, it needed rivers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">blood, it needed millions of martyrs. But at last one great power, assisted, encouraged and helped by other great powers, including your own United States, has in times of greatest trial and tribulation issued a new-day Magna Charta to the Jews, saying, “Here is the opportunity you have prayed for; here is what you have asked us in the name of eighty generations of suffering Jewry.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">World Jewry has taken advantage of that opportunity, and is today attacking the problems attendant upon reconstruction of the Jewish Homeland. Of the multitude of problems which confront us daily, the one perhaps dearest to me is the Hebrew University, which is being erected on Mt. Scopus, one of the hills surrounding Jerusalem. This University, the foundation stone of which was laid in 1918 to the accompaniment of the thunder of cannon ten miles away at the front, is being reared on the very hill over which our judges, our kings, our prophets, our young children, and young soldiers passed before the tents of Titus into oblivion and into captivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great Rome-that-was proclaimed “Judea Capta”, Judea is captive; and the mighty Roman state swept over little Judea. Today nothing is left of Titus but a marble arch, which is the admiration of tourists in Rome; but “Judea Capta” is alive again. From this very hill over which the flower of ancient Judea passed into captivity, modern Judea is laying a new siege on Jerusalem, not with guns and not with stones and not with armored legions, but with science and with art and with social justice, “that my house may be a House of Prayer for all peoples.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord Cecil on the Munition Makers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font8">HIS argument before the opium conference </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">•L </span><span class="font8">at Geneva, Lord Cecil is said to have made the assertion that one of the foes to the reduction of opium production in China is the munition maker. These munition makers, many of them professed Christians, encourage the Chinese to produce and sell more opium so that they will have the funds wherewith to buy the munitions with which they are now murdering one another. Better bring back some of the missionaries, and put them to work at making real Christians out of the proprietors of the munition factories.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font8">N TITS syndicated article of December 28th, 1924, Mr. Lloyd George said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The deepest impression left on my mind by 1924 is of a world once more reconciled to black. The iridescent colors of a now hope flung on the sky by the Great War, after becoming year by year fainter and more mildewed with the unfavorable weather that followed peace, seem finally to have faded away altogether during this year; and a dull grey hangs over the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During his farewell visit to the United States some months ago Mr. Lloyd George said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I am sure that unless something intervenes there may be in the world again a catastrophe, but not like the last one. The next war may destroy civilization, unless somebody does something.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'These words are those of a man of wide experience and strong mentality who is completely unable to fathom the present conditions or to assign a remedy, and admits as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Christmas editorial in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Newport News' </span><span class="font8">amongst other things says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘From 1914 to 1918 men feared those who had the power to kill the body. Now discriminating minds in all parts of the world stand aghast at the presence of forces which threaten to destroy civilization itself. . . . An outstanding New York financier visits Europe and returns to tell the faculties of the leading universities of the country that while there is much financial distress, much social unrest, much political chaos in Europe at the present time, the crying need here is for the voice of a prophet who will make it clear to the rebuilders of European life that no abiding civilization can be erected upon hatred and bitterness, but only upon righteousness and justice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Continuing this editorial says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What is the remedy for the situation? Business men by the score are declaring that there is but one hope for the better day, about which men are talking and that is for more of the Christian spirit and teachings and ideals in business, politics, statesmanship, education, labor organizations, international relationships and world policy. It is the testimony of the leading statisticians and leading financiers in the country that the need of America is not for more money, or more politics, or more education of the secular sort, but for more Christian thinking and Christian living.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These sayings show the helplessness of the world at this time, and show that some realize the need of divine help, and yet they stand idly by and fail to avail themselves of the help that is proffered. If a man is blind, and a physician stands by who is able to heal him, and the blind man realizes he needs a physician and yet will make no attempt to ask or procure the aid of the physician, how can he expect to be healed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The whole world is blind. This blindness is induced by Satan and his emissaries generally, amongst whom are those false prophets who have claimed to represent the Lord but who have not done so. The people are beginning to realize that the time has passed when they can expect any aid from the ecclesiastics. Truly they are just in the condition that God, through His prophet Ezekiel, stated: “And they were scattered because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered.”—Ezekiel 34: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everybody who thinks realizes the deplorable condition of the world. All are more interested in what is the remedy. Statesmen have tried to remedy the condition by a League of Nations, and that has become a byword and has brought forth nothing. The financiers have tried to stabilize the world by various financial plans, but there is no real permanent success. Some months ago a distinguished statesman suggested that the church denominations combine and bring about the necessary reformation. No one seriously believes that the church denominations can do anything to accomplish reform. If prohibition is to be taken as a sample of what can be done, then the situation is hopeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The church denominations took advantage of the war to create a situation to join hands with politicians and financiers, and put the prohibition law on the statute books. It is true that this has driven out the saloon, but it has not abolished intoxicating liquor. Far from it. On New Year’s morning, 1925, the papers announced that in the great city of New York the night before thirty-seven rum raids were made and forty-one persons arrested. Probably there were not sufficient officers of the law to visit the large fashionable hotels and look after the use of illicit liquor there. Probably some of them forgot to carry out instructions who were sent there. It is freely stated that officers in uniform mingled with the guests and diners in the large and fashionable hotels in New York city on New Year’s Eve, and watched the free flow of intoxicating liquor and made no protest and no arrests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am not speaking in criticism of the officers. Their responsibility is to the one who appointed them. It is not my business to run this world. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">cite these facts merely to show that there is no human organization that can now stabilize the world and bring about a desired condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I furthermore assert with absolute certainty that no human organization will arise that can accomplish this. The reason I so state is because the statesmen, the politicians, and the business men who would desire to see a better condition are unacquainted with the Word of God, not having been taught. Hence they do not take into consideration the cause of the trouble nor the proper remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore the clergy, at least a majority of them, who claim to administer the Word of God, are either wilfully ignorant of it or else neglect to heed or to abide by its plain statements as to the cause of the trouble and as to what is the divine remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of the good people are becoming desperate. Many others are becoming reckless, and still more are in distress, and some in despair. Is there no help? Is there no way to stabilize the world? In answer to this there comes the clear, positive statement from the Word of God, addressed to really consecrated Christians, which commands that they speak to the peoples of the world, and “say among the nations that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.”—Psalm 96:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But one who is skeptical asks: How can </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">rely upon the statements of the Bible ? I answer this by asking another question: If some good and wise man had told you fifty years ago that 1914 would mark the beginning of a great world war and that this would be quickly followed by </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">terrible pestilence and a famine and in many parts of the earth revolutions, and if you had confidence in that man and watched for the coming of that day and found that the things transpired exactly as he had told you, what would you think? You would say: Surely this man is wise beyond others and I can rely upon what he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I call your attention to the fact that nearly 1900 years ago the best and wisest Man that ever trod the soil of the earth pointed to the end of the world; and that when the question was propounded to him, 'Master, tell us, how may we know when that time comes?’ He answered; ‘There will be a world war, great famines, pestilences, and revolutions; and these shall mark the beginning of the sorrows upon the nations at the end? In Matthew 24: 7,8 He stated this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other prophecies in the Bible plainly showed that the Gentile Times would end in 1914. If we find, then, that this prophecy is fulfilled exactly on time and exactly as foretold, would not that be sufficient to cause the thoughtful and sensible man to stop and consider and to conclude that if the words of Jesus have come to pass exactly on time as He foretold then that is sufficient reason why he should rely upon the further words that He states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In further answer to the question propounded to Him concerning the end of the old order, Jesus said that “there shall be . . . upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and waves roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”—Luke 21:25,26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even a blind man can see that the world is now in distress and perplexity, and that men’s hearts are failing them for fear; and this has come exactly at the time He said it would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, the inspired writer of the Bible stated that at this time there would rise a class of men pretending to teach the Bible, who would scoff at the teaching concerning the end of the world and the second coming of the Lord and the setting up of His kingdom; and we see that transpiring also.— 2 Peter 3:5, 7, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is freely admitted by everyone that all the nations are preparing for a tremendous war. It will be worse than a war. It will be wholesale slaughter. When a fleet of airplanes can wipe out a city like London in a night, slaughter defenseless woman and children, as well as the men, then this can not be called war but a time of trouble. The Scriptures abound with proof that this is coming, and Jesus emphasized it particularly. He warned the people that it would come. Had the clergy taken heed to the Scriptural warning, and had told the people what it meant, and had tried to stabilize the world in that way instead of through the League of Nations and in utter disregard of the Bible, this very impending trouble could have been avoided. They failed to do so. They walked on in darkness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus then states that following the war, would come the famine and the pestilence and revolution. He furthermore stated that these things are evidences of the establishment of the Lord’s kingdom,and that before this final trouble the good news of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all the nations, and that then shall the end come. This is exactly what the International Bible Students have been doing in the past few years. They have carried the message of the kingdom to every country where the name of Christ is named, not with the expectation of converting the world, but with the expectation of being a witness to the coming kingdom, exactly as the Lord commanded.—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How, then, will the world be stabilized? I answer that there is but one way; and that is by Christ, the Messiah, the great Prince of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Psalmist describes the final catastrophe upon the peoples of the earth in these words: ‘■'They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.”— Psalm 107: 27-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great trouble upon the earth is the result of the failure to accept the Lord’s kingdom without opposition. But Christ Jesus, the great Prince of Peace, is now establishing His kingdom. Of course the message concerning the kingdom is opposed by the devil. It is opposed by everyone who is in league with his organization ; but there is no power under heaven that can stay the onward rush of the message of truth. As well might the opponents try to sweep dry the bay of New York with an ordinary broom as to push back the tide of truth that is now rising. God’s kingdom is at hand. The world shall be established because the great righteous King is taking possession and will dash the present wicked order to pieces, that the people might stand free to accept and be obedient to His rule of righteousness and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning this the Prophet said: “Behold a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.”—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is the Prince of Peace; the government shall be upon His shoulder, and of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end.—Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The prophet Zephaniah in 3:8 describes the terrible trouble which is now upon the world and which is increasing with fury, and which shall destroy the present evil systems. Then in the 9th verse he says: “For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the great storm of shot and poison gas falling from the sky upon the people is impending and immediately about to come, fear and trembling have taken hold of the nations and peoples everywhere. There are many in darkness who desire to know what to do and who are crying out, What shall we do at this time? The Prophet answers: “Before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you, seek ye the Lord, all ye meek [teachable] of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.”—Zephaniah 2:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is but one refuge and that is the refuge of Christ’s kingdom. There is but one name under heaven whereby man must be saved, and that is the name of Christ. Christ Jesus, the Son of God, tasted death for every man. (Hebrews 2:9) His life provided the redemptive price for all mankind. Now all shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth. The Lord promised to return and set up His kingdom. He has fulfilled His promise. The day of trouble is on now because of the resistance of the powers of darkness. The devil is blinding everyone possible to turn men’s minds away from the Lord. It is the duty of every Christian to teach his brother and his neighbor now concerning the way of the Lord, that leads to peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many of you ask: Why then do not our ministers in all of our churches preach Christ Jesus as the Redeemer and Deliverer of the human race, and His kingdom as the means of deliverance? Why do we have so many Modernists, and why are they wrangling amongst themselves instead of instructing the people concerning the Word of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In answer to this question I do not wish to be misunderstood. I have no quarrel with any man. Sarcastic criticism is unbecoming. What I say I say only because I hope that it may do good for those who have a disposition to hear. There are many men who are wise in their own conceit, and who have ignored the Bible, yielded to the seductive influences of the evil one and become blind to God’s purposes. The Lord through His prophet foretold exactly this condition. These men were once watchmen [or shepherds] for the Church, watchmen [shepherds] for the interest of the Lord. Now they ignore God, ignore the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning them the Lord’s prophet in these words, says His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they can not bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain from his quarter [congregation] .”—Isaiah 56:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord has promised His truth and blessings to all, however, that seek Him; and by His prophet He says: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters [truth] and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” —Isaiah 55:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In every church of the land for many years the prayer that Jesus taught his disciples to pray has been prayed: “Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Has this prayer been prayed in sincerity and truth ? Should we expect a fulfilment of it? We may be sure that the Lord, having taught His disciples to pray, would fulfil it in His own due time. Jesus plainly set forth that this could not be done until His return and the setting up of His kingdom. The Lord is now here. -Let the world take notice of this fact; and in this hour of distress and extremity let those who have reverential hearts turn their minds and hearts to the Lord. Having promised to establish the world in righteousness He will do it. His reign shall be in righteousness and in justice to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning the peace and blessings and stability of society that will result from the Lord’s reign the prophet in beautiful poetic language describes it thus: “But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together: a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion, shall eat straw like the ox. And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isaiah 11: 4-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord put the words into the Bible as a command to those who love Him; and He makes it the duty of all such to make proclamation of these words of consolation to the people now. Amongst these words of comfort are found those of the Prophet, as follows: “Say among the heathen, that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth; he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.”— Psalm 96: 10-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When all the business of the land is done upon the basis of justice and righteousness, when the Golden Rule is the rule amongst men, when politicians cease to exploit the people, when the financiers cease to rob them and deal in righteousness and equity, when the teachers and clergy quit denying the Scriptures and turn to the truth, when the people learn to heed and obey the righteous laws of the new government, then the world will be completely established; and peace and joy shall reign amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The work of establishing and restoring mankind will cover a period of 1,000 years. It is described as a day; and the Prophet says: “The mighty God, even the Lord, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.”—Psalm 50:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord will speak to the people then through His faithful earthly representatives. He will call to them from the beginning of the day until the going down thereof; and they that heed and obey His word shall be blessed for evermore. They shall dwell together on the earth in peace and prosperity, health and happiness; and the praises of the Lord will ever be upon their lips.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LATEST HARDBOUND BOOK NO. 3</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">»</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> With Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, n I h “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both &lt;!rsT5 Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>399</sup>It is not the purpose of this writing to enter into a detailed statement of Biblical chronology. The searcher for truth can find an extensive treatment of this question in Volumes II and III of Studies in the Scriptubes. The purpose here is to call attention to certain important dates and then see how much, if any, prophecy has been fulfilled within these dates. Chronology, to some extent at least, depends upon accurate calculations; and there is always some possibility of mistakes. Fulfilled prophecy is the record of physical facts which are actually existent and definitely fixed. Physical facts do not stultify themselves. They stand as silent witnesses whose testimony must be taken as indisputable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;“There are two important dates here that we must not confuse, but clearly differentiate, namely, the beginning of “the time of the end” and of “the presence of the Lord”. “The time of the end” embraces a period from A. D. 1799, as above indicated, to the time of the complete overthrow of Satan’s empire and the establishment of the kingdom of the Messiah. The time of the Lord’s second presence dates from 1874, as above stated. The latter period is within the first named, of course, and at the latter part of the period known as “the time of the end”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>401</sup>The understanding of the prophecies with reference to “the time of the end” and the Lord’s presence was purposely concealed by Jehovah until the due time. Daniel desired to know what would be the end of these things, but God said to him: “But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end.” (Daniel 12:4) It is reasonable to expect that Jehovah would indicate something by which “the time of the end” could be discerned when it arrived. He did not say to Daniel to look for some words emblazoned across the sky that the end had come, but told him to look for such evidences as could be seen and understood by men familiar with the prophecies, and who in the light of the prophecies should be watching for their fulfilment. He did not expect Daniel to understand it in his day; for He said: “Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.”—Dan. 12:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS ON “THE HARP OF GOD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why is fulfilled prophecy conclusive proof concerning the question at issue? (J 399.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is there a difference between the date of the beginning of the “time of the end” and the presence of the Lord ? What period of time is covered by the “time of the end” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(I 400.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Was there any reason why these important dates should be concealed for a time? Give Scriptural reason. fl 401.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Emerging from one crisis but &quot;to be confronted with ever occurring situations that had been dealt with palliatively, nations are ever working feverishly, allaying one crisis after another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Decisive dealing is involving; the immediate problems are perplexing; and because the present outlook can not be penetrated with clear foresight, the future becomes disconcerting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ominous and threatening times but make for more fear of the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There seems to be a certain trepidation that counsels the saving of energy and skill for the more threatening crisis that present problems seem to forecast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Emerging from one to a more severe crisis the world surges headlong into —people know not what.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Observed from the viewpoint of the prophets who foretold present perplexities, those threatening events that seem foreboding of calamity present a different aspect. Seen more as to what they are leading, they can be met more confidently even when they turn to the worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Harp Bible Study Course has outlined an ordered reading of the Bible, emphasizing the application of the Bible to our life. The Bible teachings are assembled in ten basic teachings; and with regularly allotted reading assignments and self-quiz cards an understanding can be had in an hour’s reading weekly for twelve weeks. An added feature increasing the scope of the course is the library of seven volumes of Studies in the Scriptures, topically arranged, with every scripture text indexed. Individual reference can be made to the text to be examined.</span></p>
