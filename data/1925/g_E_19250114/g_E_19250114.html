<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Something About Inventions and Discoveries</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">machine of 1846, Woodruff’s sleeping-car of 1856, Otis’ elevator of 1861, Westinghouse’s airbrake of 1869, Bell’s telephone of 1876, Edison’s phonograph of 1877, Edison’s incandescent lamp of 1878, Mergenthaler’s linotype of 1884, Eastman’s kodak of 1888, and Wright Brothers’ flying machine of 1903. All of these inventions also are epochal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the British ancestry and the sudden changes of the American climate from extreme heat to extreme cold that have had most to do with making Americans inventive. It is literally true that necessity is the mother of invention. In a new country men must make one tool do the work of two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Invention and Research</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;IMTANY of the great inventions were purely accidental. Rather, we should say that they are to be attributed to the hand of God, the due time for them to appear having arrived. The invention of the cotton gin came about because a woman overheard some cotton planters protesting the great amount of labor required to gin the cotton by hand. She said to them: “Why not ask my friend, Mr. Whitney, to make a machine to do it? He can make a machine to do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The way the balloon came to be invented was that a French lady set her husband at work airing her gown. He tried airing it over a small fire, and noticed that when inflated it tended to rise. A half hour later he was sending up paper balloons, and subsequently he went up in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">silk one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The invention of the pneumatic tire came about by a length of rubber hose coming in contact with the wheel of a wheelbarrow. The stationary steam engine came into general use when a lazy boy discovered that if he tied a string to one of the engine parts he could make it move back and forth the slide valve which he had been paid to operate. A woman, simply</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE inventions that have changed the face of the world have been largely the work of the British and the Americans. To be sure, the world owes an incalculable debt to the Italian Marconi for his discovery of wireless, in 1896; but Italy has not been prolific of inventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world owes a tremendous debt to France for the invention of the knitting machine by Jeandean in 1806, of the bicycle by Michaux in 1855, of the airship by Santos-Dumont in 1901, and for the discovery of radium by Madame Curie in 1898. But France is more noted for industry, economy, and style than for invention. The French are too industrious to be inventive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a sense the world owes infinite gratitude to Germany for Gutenberg’s invention of movable type in 1438, for the invention of Fahrenheit’s thermometer in 1709, and for Roentgen’s X-rays in 1895. But Germany’s inventions and discoveries as a rule have not been startling in their nature. They have been painstaking developments of inventions made by others, as witness the submarine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is when we get to Britain that we really get into inventive atmosphere. We have the steam engine of Watt in 1775, the iron plow of Small in 1784, the steel pen of Wise in 1803, the life preserver of Edwards in 1805, the locomotive of Stephenson in 1814, the calculating machine of Babbage in 1822, Guthrie’s use of chloroform in 1831, the discovery of the art of photographing on paper by Wm. H. Fox Talbot in 1839, Bessemer’s steel of 1856, and the rotary steam turbine of Parsons in 1891. All these inventions and discoveries are epochal, startling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States we have Whitney’s cotton gin of 1794, Fulton’s steamboat of 1807, Walker’s friction matches of 1827, Morse’s electric telegraph of 1832, McCormick’s reaper of 1834, Goodyear’s vulcanized rubber of 1839, Thurber’s typewriter of 1843, Howe’s sewing-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">227</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">changing the shape of a saucepan lid, made an invention that saves over sixty percent of the fuel used in cooking; for it prevented the waste of escaping steam and heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of Mr. Edison’s inventions have been accidental, but most of them have been the result of painstaking research and indefatigable industry. In searching for a filament for his incandescent lamp, he is said to have tried over eight hundred substances before he found what he wanted. Several years ago he had taken out more than nine hundred patents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The greatest corporations now have their own research departments. The Bell Telephone Company owns literally thousands of patents, the majority of which were developed in their own laboratories. In these research departments highly trained men devote their entire time to studying industrial processes, trying to find a better, less expensive way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is research that has made the automobile what it is today. No expense has been spared to search out alloys of steel that ■would accomplish safely the service that is required of some automobile parts. A flaw in the part might mean death to the driver and the occupants of the car.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Inventors Often Unrewarded</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N Messrs. Bell, Marconi, Edison and Ford we see inventors turned into millionaires; but many excellent inventions have bestowed no material rewards upon those who brought them to perfection. Whitney’s invention of the cotton gin was stolen by a score of imitators; and though he was given $50,000 by the state of Georgia to recompense him for the great good he did to the state, yet it was insufficient to pay the lawyers he engaged to try to protect him in his patent rights. He made his living in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The inventor of the sewing-machine died worth $2,000,000, but his wife died from privations forced upon her while the machine was finding its way to popularity. At one time Howe himself was discharged from the works where his machines were being manufactured because he was not considered worth the $15 per week paid to him. At one time a half interest in his patent was sold for $500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The inventor of roller skates made nothing out of his invention until just before his patents expired, when the country suddenly went rollerskate crazy and he became a millionaire. The inventor of the motion picture and the motion picture machine died in poverty in London in 1920, and was given a charity funeral by some who had made millions in the motion-picture industry. His name was W. Friese Greene. At one time he was imprisoned on charges growing out of his efforts to finance his inventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It sometimes happens that young mechanics or mill operatives make improvements which are valuable inventions, but do not know their value and part with them for nothing or for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">song. A story is told that a person walking through the tape room of a Lancashire mill noticed that a taper had a device of his own on his machine which saved him work. The visitor asked all about the device, paid the taper </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">shilling, and subsequently made a fortune by patenting the device as his own idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was five hundred years after the chemical discovery of ether before it was used as an anaesthetic to annul the shock of pain from the operating knife.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Encouragements and Discouragements</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Miller-Reese-Hutchinson Company, Inc., Woolworth Building, New York, and the Society of Inventors, London, England, aim to provide facilities for poor inventors to complete their inventions, demonstrate their ideas, and gain legal and financial assistance in putting their inventions before the people. The London Society has 1,200 members all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other side of this proposition is the fact that most inventors lose out because they seek to interest others before their ideas have clarified even in their own minds. Some lose out because their patent attorneys are incompetent or crooked, and others because their ideas are worthless. Often a patent or series of patents amounts substantially only to the right to begin a series of expensive lawsuits, lasting from two to fifteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Patent Office is peculiar in that the laity cannot deal directly with it. The work must be done through lawyers, who usually receive $15 for filing an application and $20 for obtaining the patent. This is about the minimum. The Patent Office does not cost the public anything. The inventors pay the entire cost, and a great deal more, in their fees. In issuing a patent the Government does not guarantee anything. If there are infringements the inventor must fight for his rights in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, it often happens that after an idea has been patented it takes many years and several fortunes to get it into actual use. This was the case with the Cottrell multicolor press, the Ingersoll watch and the Blickensderfer typewriter. After the first patents were issued on the “Blick” it required an expenditure of $400,000 to fit it for the market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some patents are bought up by large corporations, and suppressed because better ways of accomplishing the same ends are subsequently found. No reasonable objection can be offered to this, from the standpoint of efficiency; but from the standpoint of public policy it is bad practice. It tends to make the great corporations ever greater, with a less and less chance for the common people.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Inventors Need Common Sense</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T SOMETIMES happens that inventors perfect a process for doing what nobody cares to have done, like the one who laboriously worked out the details of a plan to do away with metallic type in newspaper offices, only to find to his surprise that the same metal was used over and over again with no loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt, too, most of our readers have heard of the man who invented a hen’s nest, so designed as to switch the newly laid egg out of sight, and thus bluff the hen into thinking she had not accomplished what she supposed, with a view of getting her to lay another in its place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perpetual-motion machines have caused six hundred people in Britain to part with their hard-earned money; and so many such machines have been offered for patent in this country that the Patent Office has a form letter which explains to the unfortunates that in the end their ideas will not work, and that they had better save their money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men have invented beds that would collapse unless lazy occupants rose at the proper time. Women have invented such useful articles as a cow-tail holder, a reinforced bowl in which to beat eggs, and an artificial eyelash, for which the immediate market is not apparent. However, artificial eyelashes may come into style at any moment.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>No End to Inventive Genius</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HERE will never be an end to human inventive genius. There will always be new things to discover, and plenty who will find their joy in trying to make the discoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the clerks resigned from the Patent Office in 1833 because he was convinced that every possible idea had been invented and patented and that the office would soon have to close up shop. Since then, in one year, seventy thousand patents have been applied for. Four thousand a month is considered a small number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The crazy idea of one generation becomes the home comfort of the next. When Thomas A. Edison first conceived the idea of the phonograph he thought it such a crazy idea that he even laughed at himself. Now in millions of homes the phonograph is the family’s source of entertainment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few years ago nobody knew anything about electricity, and nobody knows what it is even yet. But this strange force is now able to unmake the great cities which are such a blot upon the landscape, because all the comforts they furnish can now be distributed far and wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the domain of war, invention has reached such a pitch that everybody now knows that our Lord foretold the exact situation confronting humanity when He prophesied of this day that “unless those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved”. Even during the World War the Germans shot shells larger than a grown man a distance of seventy-fivo miles. But that is nothing in destructiveness to the new gas warfare. Every new scientific discovery gives rise to thousands of inventions.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Some of the Things Desired</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font7">OME of the things that even now are wanted in the home are a furnace that will conserve most of the heat which it generates, a process that will make flannel unshrinkable, a key that will not lose its identification, a new game of skill, a plan by which house refuse can be easily and cheaply destroyed at home, and a greatly simplified clothing which is not strange in appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the mechanical arts there is desired </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">glass that will not bend, a motor engine that will not weigh more than one pound per horsepower generated, a method of reducing friction, an internal combustion turbine, a method of </span><span class="font6">using </span><span class="font7">atomic energy and the power of the tides, and an improved method of electrical storage and power transmission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the field of transportation there is desired a noiseless airplane, one that can be easily and safely managed by a boy or girl, a smooth road surface that will not be slippery in wet ■weather, a horse-shoe that will enable a horse to keep its feet on smooth surface roads, a motor headlight that will light the road surface without dazzling the eyes of others, and a means whereby a ship’s officers can inform themselves accurately of the position, speed and direction of approaching ships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some other things which are desired and upon which inventors are at work, as they are upon all the items just mentioned, are a process of instantaneous color photography, a selective method of radio communication with really sharp tuning, a method of conveying speech directly and readably to paper, and a means of regulating the rain supply or of inducing and preventing rain.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Social-Educational Inventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font7">NE may go to a French post office, at any time since the first of the year 1924, write a letter on a revolving cylinder, illustrate the letter by charts or diagrams, and sign his name; and the whole matter will be received by telegraph by the person to whom the letter is addressed, with everything so accurately reproduced telautographically that the transmitted signatures are valid in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is also now available but not yet in general use, a device for potting telephone messages. A calls up B, and finds him out. He sets in motion a recording instrument; and the message which he dictates is impressed upon a steel ribbon at the receiving end, which on being run through another simple device repeats the message as received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Admiral Fiske has invented a vest-pocket machine which, if it comes into general use, will do away with fifty-nine sixtieths of the paper and ink now used in printing. A complete set of encyclopedias can be comfortably carried on the person and read with ease, all by a simple process of magnifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another benefactor of the male species has invented a combined handle and rubber bulb which produces immediately and lays upon the face a rich lather, thus doing away with the old-time shaving brush. This device is said to be cleanly, and eminently satisfactory to those who have tried it. Some of the new shaving creams, put on with the finger tips, are also quick, easily applied and in every way desirable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Yankee to find some way to get work done without having to do it themselves will in time solve most of the problems of labor on the farm. Indeed, many of them have been solved already.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ever since cotton was first used, the picking of it has been a drudgery. Now Mr. G. R. Bennett, of Wilkinsburg, Pa. has invented a machine which picks, cleans, and gins cotton in a single operation. This is bound to work vast changes in the South. It is estimated that the invention of this one machine will effect a saving of $500,000,000 a year. Concerning this invention the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font7"> naively says: “There is a possibility that some of the savings will be passed along to consumers of cotton goods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another invention which is full of hope for the human family as a whole, even though it is filled with terror for the producer, is the container invented by Dr. H. Barringer Cox of Cleveland, Ohio, in which fruits and vegetables may be preserved indefinitely without the use of ice or chemicals, the earth’s magnetism being the preservative force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr Cox has just died; and there is much wonderment as to what will become of his invention. He was a noted inventor; and this invention was declared by scientists who examined it to be simple, inexpensive, and practical. It would be an unspeakable calamity if his device should fall into the hands of the beef trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed that the new Hamshaw rotary plow pulverizes ninety percent of the soil in the first operation, chopping up all surface vegetation and mixing it thoroughly with the seedbed thirteen inches deep. It is expected that this will greatly reduce the farmer’s work of preparing his soil for seeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The invention of a Minneapolis man, Dr. Julius Hortvet, of the State Dairy and Food Commission, enables him to tell in eight minutes exactly what amount of water has been added to cows’ milk. This can be done, no matter how thin or how thick the milk was when first produced.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">San Francisco inventor named Eigholz has produced a non-inflammable, non-ex</span><span class="font7">plosive and non-poisonous liquid which eradicates rust without the slightest injury to the metal; and which when poured upon the surface of ordinary wood, leaves no more effect than ordinary water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A stainless silver has been discovered in England, and is actually on the market, much to the trepidation of dealers who are stocked with the old-style goods. They fear, and rightly so, that when people find that they can buy silver which never tarnishes, they will not purchase the kind that requires constant polishing to keep presentable. Any metal article may now be made stainless by an electro-deposition of chromium.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The thread from silk cocoons, hitherto unreeled by hand, is now unreeled by machinery, and may reduce the cost of silk to a point where it can compete with cotton and Hnen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Richard Soderberg, of the Westinghouse Company at East Pittsburgh, has applied for patents for a device which controls the vibrations set up by small bodies revolving at high speeds. This invention is expected to prove of great value in railway and electrical work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By means of the thermoinic valve it is possible to measure the two-billionth part of an inch or the one-billionth part of a second. By the use of this device, if a half grain of radium were to be divided into equal shares and distributed share and share alike to every person on earth, it would be possible to recognize any one of the shares.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, is credited with two important in</span><span class="font7">ventions in the field of transportation. One is a speed boat which literally flies over the water at a speed of seventy-one miles an hour. Another is a device for travelers crossing the desert. By breathing in air through the nose and expelling it through a glass tube into a bottle, as much as an ounce of water was obtained in an hour, sufficient to maintain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The rolling of steamships is counteracted by a U-shaped tank, placed crosswise of the vessel, and of such proportions that the period of oscillation of the water in the tank is exactly one-half the period of oscillation of the boat. As the ship tips one way, the water in the tank rises on the opposite side, with a steadying and quieting effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Diesel motor is making such changes in shipping that as high as twenty-four men have been omitted from the crew of a single vessel after it has been equipped with these motors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">French aviators are said to regard as an event of the near future the mail airplane which will fly without a person aboard and deliver its cargo safely, guided to its destination by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The necessity of some definite plan of traffic control has led a scientist to declare that within five hundred years all public thoroughfares will be underground and as smooth as a billiard ball. This seems like a wild guess, but it may be so. The present situation is intolerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Electricians predict that within the next six years the electric service will be doubled. This means that electricians will be called upon to create as much within that time as has been created so far in the entire history of the industry.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Mining and Sea Inventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">NEW miners’ lamp has been invented which sings when the air of a coal mine contains more than two percent of firedamp, thus warning the miner of impending danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An engineer in Johannesburg has invented an automatic drill-sharpening furnace which, it is stated, will enable the profitable working of huge quantities of ore hitherto considered Unprofitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Frenchman, M. Eugene Royer, has invented a device which enables a diver to light and operate an oxy-acetylene flame at a depth of 1.30 feet below the surface, and to saw through thick steel plates at the rate of fifteen inches per minute, or six times faster than by the old methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Norwegian, Captain N. A. Lybeck, has constructed an apparatus which attracts fish by a powerful searchlight, catches them by a paddle wheel rotating at great velocity, and literally showers the deck with fish as the boat moves through the water. It is claimed to be the most efficient fishing device ever tried.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Power Transmission Inventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">T WAS only fifteen years ago that electrica^ transmission of power was first attempted. The first transmission was over a line thirteen miles long. Today, in southern California, 220,-000 volts are transmitted 250 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">William Emmet’s invention of the mercury boiler is hailed as the most important since the steam turbine. It is hoped to drive both by mercury<sup>7</sup> vapor and by water vapor from the same fuel source, resulting in a gain of about fifty percent in the work obtained from the fuel used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is an urgent need for economy in fuel. It is stated that at present out of 2,000 pounds actually exploited, 600 pounds of coal are lost in mining, 126 pounds consumed at the mine, 446 pounds go up the stack in gas, 102 pounds go into the ashpit, 650 pounds are lost in converting heat into power; and that only 76 pounds actually perform the work intended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Inventors express themselves as thinking that discoveries along the lines of power production and power transmission mean more to the world than do any other. Samuel Insull, for many years Edison’s private secretary, believes that the age of transportation is now merging into the age of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With sufficient power at their disposal mankind can do almost anything. French engineers have estimated that with a unit of electricity equal to one horse-power for forty-five minutes sufficient power is developed to make nine pounds of ice, or boil two gallons of water, or grill fifteen cutlets, or plow one hundred twenty square yards of land a foot deep, or thresh one hundred forty sheaves of wheat, or make four hundred pounds of butter, or pump a thousand gallons of water into a tank fifty feet above ground, or light for twenty-five hours </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">hall thirty feet wide and fifty feet long.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Renewed Interest in Water Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HE great things that have been done for the people of Ontario by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission are causing sane people on this side of the line to sit up and take notice. For $1.25 per month the Canadian within the territory covered by the Commission can light his house, wash his clothes, and cook his food. It used to cost him seven times as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States has a Federal Power Commission, struggling along with eighteen clerks and twelve other men, entrusted with the leasing of Uncle Sam’s water-power sites to private corporations. There is enough water power going to waste in the United States to do all the work of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experiments at Pittsburgh have demonstrated that 1,000,000 volts can be loaded upon a wire, and that with such a load electricity can be safely and economically transported a thousand miles. This means that no matter how remote the source of power it can be made to do useful work. A plant in the mid-Rockies would furnish power to any point west of the Missouri River; one in the mid-Appalachians, to any point east of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America is far behind Europe in water-power development. Perhaps three-fourths of the water-power sites of Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Sweden are in use, while in New York State only about one-fourth is used. America has 35,000,000 horse-power undeveloped water power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">California is the most advanced of any Amer-~ ican state in the use of its water sites. It has an unbroken interconnected system twelve hundred miles long; and the Edison Company of Los Angeles is about putting another project into effect near the Imperial Valley that will cost $100,000,000.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Searching High and Low</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-7.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">HE search for power extends up into the clouds and down into the bowels of the earth. A German professor named Krist thinks that he has found a way to cause the upper atmosphere to discharge constantly its electrical energy and tension into receiving stations located upon terra firma; and that if his plans can be sufficiently developed, electrical storms will disappear. The Plauson plan, as it is termed, would require the use of batteries </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">stationary balloons, with metal covered surfaces. The first cost would be high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The internal heat of the earth has been used in volcanic regions in Italy, Hawaii and Bolivia; and it may be used soon in California and some other American states where the earth’s crust is broken. But it does not seem possible to break the crust except where nature has assisted. It is estimated that at five miles depth we should reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which would give us superheated steam; but the deepest well ever bored never went deeper than a mile and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tidal power is utilized a little, in a few places. There are one or two points on the Pacific Coast and a few places in Europe where the tides are used; but the contrivances are admittedly clumsy makeshifts. Impounding of tide waters is declared impractical. Here is a problem of which inventors have not yet found the key. The power is there; but how to make a wise use of it appears not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a point in Utah where the winds are always vigorous there has been installed or will shortly be installed a gigantic wind turbine weighing 246 tons. Surplus power will be conserved by a system of electric storage batteries. This source of power might be much more widely used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is significant that Marconi and Steinmetz have both expressed their confidence that the ultimate source of power for mankind will come from the discovery of a way to utilize atomic power. Indeed, a Leipzig engineer reported in 1920 that he had actually discovered it; but as far as the public are concerned, the invention is still in the making. If this discovery is ever made, it will put an end to all transportation and power problems. A man could then carry on his person enough stored power to drive an aeroplane around the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have no doubt that the Lord will permit such a discovery some time soon, perhaps just a little while before man is fit to use it. That seems to be the Lord’s way. Man knows so much about war now that he is afraid of </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font7">self. He knows that he has it in his power to destroy his race. In due time the Lord will teach him to use his powers for the good of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We close with reference to a new method of transmitting power discovered by a Rumanian professor. We have had five methods in use: Steam, direct mechanical, electric, compressed air, and hydraulic. The professor discovered a wave power which travels at the speed of sound through water, i. e., at about a mile a second ; and which will do, without danger of fire or explosion, anything that can be done by an alternating electric current. He discovered this through experimenting with a violin string. All of this goes to show the curious way in which inventions come about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We cannot say that the Lord set the professor to playing with the violin string, although He might even have done that. But we do think that the Lord’s due time had come to make the secret known, and that He used such an instrumentality and such a method as suited His own purposes for bringing the truth to the light of day. He has done this regarding His plan of salvation, the greatest and best of all discoveries.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Distressed When</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font7">OTHING distresses the clergy so much as to have the people learn anything about what the Bible teaches respecting the wages of sin. When the people find that the Bible really teaches that the wages of sin is death and not eternal torment, the clergy business ceases to be a paying proposition. This is the true explanation of the following despatch from Gadsden, Alabama, which appeared in the Birmingham </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font7"> recently:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Negroes of Gadsden, Attalla and Alabama City will gather at the Mt. Zion Church in Attalla Sunday after-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“It is said that the preachers and leaders among the Negroes of the three towns recently learned that many such books had been sold, and that they might have a bad influence on many of the race. As a consequence they went around and collected the books; and Sunday the volumes will make a big bonfire. It is said that the pastors of the white churches, at least of the Methodist and Baptist, will deliver addresses at this unique ceremony.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">N OFFICIAL of the American Federation of Labor, testifying before a Senate committee, furnished the interesting information that the labor cost in a ton of anthracite coal, which sells in New England for $16 per ton, is $2.40. High cost of finance! Eh! What!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the year 1919 the employes of General Motors Corporation saved and invested in the company’s savings and investment fund the average sum of $97.60. The company has just made a settlement for these loans, resulting in an average return to each investor of $292.70. The corporation adds fifty cents to each dollar saved and invested by the employe, and assures employes a minimum return of better than twenty percent a year for the five-year period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The doctors of Washington have organized a union, officially known as the Medical Society of the District of Columbia. The rates for consulfation vary from $2 to $10 and for major operations from $300 to $5,000. It is against the rules to diminish the fees except for motives of charity and benevolence. Offenders against the members will be blacklisted. Members agree to assist one another in the collection of obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Near Syracuse, New York, a few days before Thanksgiving, thieves stole from an old man ninety-five years of age his flock of turkeys, upon which he depended for his support. A man who would stoop to so mean a robbery is in a class with the man who holds out to his fellows a prospect of eternal torture after their having lived and died in wretchedness and misery in this life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having millions more than he knew' what to do with, Joseph Leiter, a Massachusetts gentleman, foresaw prohibition coming and stocked his cellar with $50,000 worth of high-priced tanglefoot, only to have some ungracious hijackers invade the premises in his absence, break in his front door, and carry off all his wild juices in a truck. From now on he will have to depend upon the more or less regular, and more or less unsatisfactory, services of professional bootleggers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the city of Washington, D. C., there are thirty-three apartments that are mortgaged for nine million dollars more than they would sell for in a fair market. The tenants, few of whom </span><span class="font4">on a wave length of 273 meters, by the Editor] </span><span class="font7">could rightly be said to be overpaid if they work for the Government, are compelled to pay rents based upon the interest requirements of these mortgages; and two thousand of them have begged the President to give them army tents and places to camp in the parks so that they may not have to give all their earnings to the usurers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mary A. Kellogg, of Washington, D. C., writing to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Labor,</span><span class="font7"> of that city, says: “I moved into the Clifton Terrace apartment house in 1920. My apartment has one room, a kitchenette and bath. I paid $27.50 a month when I moved in. I am now paying $40. I have received notice (three days after election) to sign a new lease at $55 if I wish to keep my apartment. My annuity from the Government, as retired employe, yields $55.16, a month. If I pay the rental now asked, it will leave me sixteen cents of my monthly pension.”</span></p>

Now there are more than one hundred of them, twenty-five of this number being within one block of the point indicated. One of these banks, the Harriman National, has just paid $304 a square foot for an adjoining property, the highest price ever paid for land in New York. The bank will erect a $5,000,000 structure on the site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the close of 1923 sixteen of the great American corporations held cash and investments totaling $1,200,000,000. The steel trust headed the list with $346,000,000; the General Electric was next with $91,000,000; then came the American Telephone and Telegraph with $88,000,000, the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey with $87,000,000, the General Motors with $84,000,000. It is anticipated that the cash on hand at the end of 1924 will be still greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The foreign loans in the United States during 1924 were three times the total foreign loans of 1923 and twenty-five percent more than in any previous year. Since the close of the war the total foreign loans in the United States amount to over four billion dol-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At least one Construction Company operating New York is paying off its men with money sent by airplane, fearing the holdups now so common on the highways. This is all right and ought to work well, until some hijacker who learned how to manage an airplane during the war concludes that he should turn his talent in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The motor vehicles of the United States travel three hundred million miles daily during the month of heaviest traffic, which is July. This information is gleaned from the amount of gasoline consumed. Where the roads are good, the same amount of mileage can be covered for seventy cents that will require one dollar where the roads are bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bear Mountain Bridge, fifty miles up the Hudson from New York, was opened on Thanksgiving Day, on which occasion five thousand automobiles crossed the bridge, connecting Peekskill with the western shore of the Hudson. This bridge has a total length of 2,257 feet, making it at this time the world’s longest suspension bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fastest distance run ever made was on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad, between Chicago and Buffalo, October 25, 1895. The total weight of engine and train was 408,000 pounds. It made the 510 miles between Chicago and Buffalo in 7 hours, 50 minutes and 20 seconds, an average speed of 64.8 miles per hour. Between Erie and Buffalo it reached a speed of 92 miles an hour at one point.</span></p>

Reports had it that not even water was used, and certainly no one can say that any reason exists why any should have been. The reports at hand stated that the ceremony of christening would probably consist of Mrs. Coolidge’s pulling some ribbons and releasing some pigeons. This seems an eminently fitting ceremony. The old champagne custom was foolish, and harked back to the days when wine flowed freely everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is good news from Florida. A county -sheriff, a county judge, and two deputy sheriffs have been indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of peonage; and along with them there are also in the toils of the law two turpentine operators, a commissary manager and a bookkeeper. These folks could have kept out ofl trouble by subscribing to The Golden Age, and reading the thrilling expose of conditions there a few years ago, and the steps taken by the good people of Florida at that time to prevent a recurrence of such scandals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Major W. O. Watts, former head of inspection service of the Veterans’ Bureau, District No. 2, is reported as having resigned because he could not see the wisdom or justice of a system which necessitated an average outlay of nearly $1,000 to pay $10 compensation to a disabled veteran. He thought that something ought to be done to cut down the expense and so resigned. He made a mistake. He should have stayed in, and made the other fellows resign. If the country had a few more real patriots like Mr. Watts the costs would come down, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If Uncle Sam gets into another war he expects to save at least a billion dollars by getting into it so quickly that the other fallow will wonder how it happened. This, in effect, is alleged to have been the end in view When Mr. Gary of the steel trust, Mr. Schwab of Bethlehem, and other great industrialists visited West Point on November thirteenth and consulted with experts there as to the initial steps that would be taken in event of a new war. In Chicago, the day previous, 148 men were mobilized by radio inside of two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In collecting the data from which its cotton crop reports are completed, the United States Department of Agriculture makes use of seven hundred county reporters, each of whom has four or five assistants. Then it receives reports from 16,000 cotton gins, 12,000 cotton planters, 1,000 rural carriers, and 15,000 special reporters ; such as bankers, merchants, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Carl Thompson, Secretary of the Public Ownership League, asks the following questions: “If the city of Tacoma has found a way to deliver electric service to its people for one cent a kilowatt hour for cooking and heating in their homes, is there any reason why Tarkio and Trenton should not hear about it? If Cleveland has found a way to deliver electricity to its people for 3 cents a kilowatt while others pay 9, is it a crime for Chillicothe and Corning to hear about it? And if Ontario has discovered and applied the principles of a new system in the electric power field whereby a whole state is served with power at one-third the cost elsewhere, must the very pillars of the republic be pulled down rather than allow Osage, Onawa, and Odeboldt to find out about it ?”</span></p>

Winters, California, received London, England; Regina, Saskatchewan, received Turin, Italy; Yakima, Washington, received Newcastle, England; Sedalia, Missouri, received Aberdeen, Scotland; Duluth, Minnesota, received Madrid, Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before shooting any more birds it would be a good idea to look up what the Department of Agriculture has to say about mice. In one Kansas orchard five thousand trees were girdled and ruined in a single fall before the middle of December. A mouse has no sense. It starts to gnaw, and gnaws clear around the tree in a circle until the tree is ruined. The natural foes of mice are owls, hawks, shrikes, cranes, herons, crows, and magpies. Foxes, skunks, raccoons, and weasels also give them plenty of excitement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Charles H. Mayo, one of America’s most successful surgeons, announces that two Australians have discovered a method of curing rigid paralysis, which he has tried several times within the last year with success. By removal of certain sympathetic nerves, the patient’s ability to change his position quickly is restored; and after the operation the patient usually gains in muscular power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One kind of trouble at once is enough for most people; but in the wholesale drug business they now have to keep track of 50,000 proprietary articles, each one of which is supposed to be good for something that ails somebody. The human family as a whole would be better off if they would dump all these on a scow, and take the scow out to sea and sink it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a horse has a holiday its caretaker, if he is wise, cuts down on its feed. When a human being has a holiday, he proceeds to stuff himself about twice as full as usual. The natural result follows that after every hohday, within about forty-eight .hours, there is always a marked increase in the number of sudden deaths of persons over forty years of age. After last Thanksgiving Day there were sixteen such deaths in New York city in forty-eight hours.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">DMITTING, as all must, that the farmer is not the one that gets the money for the wheat which he produces, a hint as to the real situation is afforded by the organization of the $500,000,000 bakers’ trust, and the statement of its chairman: “The business of baking bread and cake looms brightly on the horizon of business enterprise. It is classed high in the scale of industries in the United States, and yet the baking business is in its infancy.” The new corporation plans to take over bakeries in all large cities of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A showman in Philadelphia was using three elephants in a vaudeville stunt, but they broke loose and put on an act not on the program. They became frightened at a balky automobile, broke their chains, and started to explore the city. It was breakfast time; and they came in through the back door of a house, taking the door with them. Incidentally they had smashed a fence on the way. Arrived in the kitchen, one of them was burned by the stove and became peevish, mussing up all that part of Philadelphia. They were finally captured.</span></p>

The editor should have headed his article differently. It should have read “Unsanitary Thoughts”, instead of “Salutary Thoughts”. Fear always does harm; never does it do any good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God dwelleth not in temples made with hands, said St., Stephen, just before martyrdom. Nevertheless Bishop Manning wants a twelvemillion dollar collection in January, so that he can complete the Cathedral of St. John the Divine; and he tells why he wants it, as follows : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The cathedral which we are now to build will bring the Church again into view. Standing on these heights, where nothing can obscure or hide it, with its great central tower rising 500 feet from the foundation, this great building will bring the Church back into the place which belongs to it in the sight of all the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With a gasp we can only express our wonderment at what has become of the church built by jhe Carpenter of Nazareth and the fishermen and tax collectors of Capernaum and Bethsaida. Is it possible that they erred in not erecting a great cathedral with a steeple a mile high? Maybe so; but we wonder!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Referring to the acceptance of an ex-Baptist into the Presbyterian ministry in New York, and to his so-called Modernist answers to questions propounded to him, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Progress-Index </span><span class="font7">says: “It will strike the average layman, perhaps, and certainly the average non-professor of Christianity, that a man who does not believe in the story of the Virgin birth, who does not believe the story that Christ called forth Lazarus from the tomb, and who believes that Joseph was the physical father of Christ, has no place in a Christian pulpit.” While the choosing of this so-called minister of the gospel was going on, the clerk of the session was obliged to say to the assembled clergymen, in an effort to control their boisterous outbursts of applause: “This is no tennis tournament, or ball game, or prizefight. This is a most sacred meeting; and I am ashamed of you men. You are acting disgracefully.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">THE Washington post-office used extra help J- to take care of the annual Christmas rush. Sixty extra trucks were employed to handle the increase in parcel post packages, and 450 clerks were added to the regular force. Between December 15 and 25 increase in letter mail is about 200 percent, and in parcel post 400 percent. The Washington post-office handled 9,500,000 letters and cards during this short interval last year. Three million of these were deposited December 21 and 22. There were also 180,000 large packages and 59,000 pieces for special delivery. Washington, according to the Postmaster General, mails out more Christmas mail in proportion to its size than any other city in the U. S. This is occasioned by the fact that more people live here whose home-folks are scattered all over the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite the storm of protest in Washington and elsewhere, the U. S. S. Washington, superdreadnaught and first-line battleship, was towed from the League Island Navy Yard at Philadelphia, to the Virginia capes, on November 12, and after several days bombardment, was sunk in compliance with the Naval Disarmament Treaty with Great Britain, Japan and France. Desperate efforts were made in the courts here to save the great ship, which was 85 percent completed; but to no avail. Complaint was registered in the court by William B. Shearer, naval expert, that the sinking of the Washington represented a waste of the taxpayers’ money. He sought a “restraining order”, or injunction, against the proceeding on this and other grounds. But Secretary Wilbur was immovable in his determination to send her to the bottom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On Armistice Day President Coolidge visited the tomb of the “Unknown Soldier” at Arlington and placed a wreath on the same. Memorial services were also held in honor of Woodrow Wilson at the crypt in Mt. St. Albans Cathedral. It seems that there should be no soldiers unknown, in view of the finger-print system now in vogue. By a process of elimination in these files it would be easily possible for an expert to determine this soldier’s full name, birthplace, date of birth, parents, educational attainments and age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the Galveston flood an unidentified man was found drowned; his fingers were cut off and sent to Washington. When they arrived the skin had slipped off; but the expert made wooden fingers, pasted the skin on and in less than five minutes completely identified the man as an enlisted soldier !■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lee Turner, an Indian prospector recently called on President Coolidge with reference to a gold mine which he claims to have discovered on land once in possession of Chief Geronimo, but which subsequently was taken over by the Government, and upon which Turner has staked out a claim. He hopes to secure the assurance of the President that he will be protected in his rights. It will be interesting to observe the outcome. As a rule, the Government cheats the Red Man, and it would be surprising if this lone Indian should receive fair treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Pension Bureau announces that there are 10,548 retired civil service employes drawing annuities at the close of the past fiscal year, in comparison to 9,334 for the previous year. The Bureau also states that there are 14,217 fewer pensioners on the Government rolls than last year. In 1924 it declares that $229,994,777 were paid out for pensions, as against $263,012,500 in 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is reported that the President will retain his present cabinet, and it is also stated that there will be no change in the new administration from that of the past fifteen months of his incumbency. It is declared that a great business boom is under way, as a result of the triumph of “conservatism”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States Coast Guard has been organizing to fight the rum fleet along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and now announces that the end of the fleet is near. The Coast Guard has been enlarged considerably, and officials aver that the international purveyors of liquor can not hold out long against the organization. It is said that the worst localities at the present time are along the Atlantic coast from New England to the Chesapeake Bay, the Florida coast, Gulf of Mexico and the Southern California coast. The Coast Guard has put into service twenty old destroyers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">which have been reconditioned and revamped for the new service. Some idea of the herculean task which devolves upon this service is seen in the fact that it has something like 10,000 miles of coast line to patrol, all of which is menaced by the rum runners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bureau of Standards, in cooperation with the Arlington Wireless Station, recently succeeded in setting the clock at the Bureau by wireless. It is announced that all clocks will eventually be regulated in this manner by wireless! Truly, the Millennium draws on apace!</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>How Mr. Coolidge Came to be President</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">[“The Arbitrator,” in its issue of November gives the following interesting information as to how Mr. Coolidge came to be President:]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N 1919 the Boston police were working from</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">73 to 98 hours a week for comparatively small pay. In July 1,100 police joined the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">erican Federation of Labor and Police Commissioner Curtis filed charges against 19 of the officers of their local union. Mayor) Peters appointed a committee of 34 citizens to investigate. They reported that the police should not affiliate with the A. F. of L., but that they were “shocked and humiliated” at the conditions under which the men were working. They suggested a compromise and, receiving no reply from Curtis, appealed to Governor Coolidge to avert the impending strike. He replied that it was not his duty to get mixed up in it, so he did nothing, although the Commissioner of Police was appointed by the Governor and not by the Mayor. On Sunday, September 7, the citizens committee endeavored to submit to Curtis a plan approved by them and the policemen’s union, but the Commissioner could not be found. Then they attempted to find Governor Coolidge, but he was away also at this critical period. Some say he was conferring with Curtis and that neither wanted the strike averted. Failing to find the Commissioner or the Governor the committee showed the plan to the newspapers and obtained the endorsement of eight editors. Mayor Peters told Curtis he approved of the plan, but Curtis dismissed the 19 policemen on September 8, and the strike which could have been avoided became inevitable. The Mayor and the committee then notified Governor Coolidge of the seriousness of the situation and requested 3000 troops to be present in Boston on the following day. Coolidge did nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Commissioner Curtis insisted he was prepared to handle the situation with men he had been drilling, and it was not until after this assurance had been made public that the police voted to strike. About noon of Tuesday, Coolidge sent a letter to the Mayor refusing to take action and adding, “There is no authority in the office of the Governor for interference in the making of orders by the Police Commissioner. ... I am unable to discover any action that I can take.” Thus, in the fourth instance, Coolidge refused to act. At 5:45 P. M. the same day 1,100 policemen walked out. Curtis did not call the new men into service; and at 6 o’clock rioting began, continuing during the night without check. It is not known where Coolidge was that night, but he took no action to quiet the disorder. On Wednesday, Mayor Peters called out the State guard and restored order. He suggested to Curtis and the police that a compromise be made, but Curtis and his attorney Parker refused. Then Coolidge wired<sup>1</sup> to Samuel Gompers, “There is no right to strike against the public service by anybody, anywhere, anytime.” He refused to consider the settlement proposed by the Mayor and increased the troops to 10,000 with 1,000 naval militia. 20,000 stands of new army rifles were shipped in from Camp Devens. Curtis advertised for new policeman at $500 more than the old men had received. Thirteen men were killed, some by the raw militia, and the loss of property was large. The cost to the State for the National Guard was $1,000,000 and the subsequent increase in police salaries was $700,000, although the strikers would have been satisfied with $227,000. The citizens committee reported, “By Thursday morning order had generally been restored in the city. On Thursday afternoon the Governor assumed control of the situation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As usual, the public did not know the facts, so elected Coolidge Vice-President.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Maintaining Good Health</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from station WBBR on a wave length of 273 meters by C. E. Stewart.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font7">EOPLE die in three ways: They die morally, they die mentally, they die physically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The penitentiary, the asylum, and the hospital are from one viewpoint the ante-chamber of the cemetery. Moral delinquency is the worst of all diseases; mental disorders lead to all kinds of depravity; but physical ailments result from abuse and the wearing out of our organic machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The penalty of death came upon the race legitimately; and in the dying process weaknesses and disorders have multiplied ..as the natural concomitants of the edict, “Dying thou shalt die.” Alienation from God, ignorance respecting the laws of nature, imperfect foods and the wrong method of their preparation, have all contributed to undermine the constitution of man, debilitating him, and rendering him unfit to meet the exigencies of life with the vigor and hardiness that one might reasonably expect of our enlightened age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a person is sick physically, he is ailing mentally to some degree; for when the human organism is diseased or sluggish there is bound to be a reaction upon the mental faculties. Reversely, when a person violates his conscience or wilfully perverts his reason, there is an influence or chemical action set up in the physical organism which is debilitating, however little it may be noticed. We quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The mind could not be perfectly sound, while supported and nourished by an unsound body. The deranged stomach of the dyspeptic has a direct effect upon his mind, as well as upon his entire physical system. The person whose lungs are diseased cannot avoid a degree of mental impairment corresponding. Likewise, when other organs—the heart, the liver, the kidneys—are diseased and perform their functions imperfectly, the effect unquestionably is disordered blood, and a disordered nervous system, the center of which is the brain. Likewise the brain that is harassed by pain or that is imperfectly nourished through malnutrition or fevered through failure of the action of the secretive organs, is sure to be impaired in all its various functions; it cannot think and reason as correctly or as logically as if in perfect condition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If it hurt as much to have a mental or a moral ache as it does to have a physical ache, perhaps some would be more careful how they used their thinking machines. A tender conscience would gi ve grave concern, but many consciences are calloused. But we shall not now treat of mind and heart disorders particularly. Confining ourselves to the care of the body is our present privilege. According to the Bible, the time is coming in Messiah’s kingdom when there will not be a sick person in all the world, either mentally, morally, or physically. The imperfections we now have will all be eliminated during Christ’s reign; but when that time comes, it will require the cooperation of the individual himself to reap the benefits of the change. Meantime, let us do what we can do to get well and to stay well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increase of knowledge, peculiar to our day, makes it possible for us to glean something of the remarkable composition of man, his various organs, the way they function, and what is necessary for us to eat in the rebuilding of bone and tissue. There are many theories, but all of them register their failures. Each of us has an internal machine peculiar to himself ; and only by experimentation is it possible to approximate what gives the best results in each individual case. Set rules are disastrous.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>The Digestion of Food</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-12.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">TRONG and heavy foods that are hard to digest should be taken only by those who have strong digestive organs and who have need of such food to maintain the normal condition. Light and easily digested foods should be the portion of the younger generation. Some parents feed their youngest children on a little of everything that is on the table, thus paving the way for a broken-down digestive apparatus later on. Light foods are good for all classes; for the stomach needs to rest. This is a fact that few people seem to realize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The exercise of the will is a prerogative we have which is seldom made use of at the table. Most people have lost sight of the fact that we should eat to live and not live to eat. Cultivated appetites are the bane of good health. Three square meals a day is a foolish indulgence. To put fifty-seven varieties of food into the human haymow, gulping the conglomerate mass down with liquid, three times a day, expecting our bone, blood, and flesh-manufacturing plants within to appropriate, tag, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">pigeon-hole their respective needs properly, and then to cast the refuse into the sewer without damaging the machinery, is the height of folly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Food of every description needs mastication. The mechanical part of the digestion must be correctly accomplished to insure the best results. Even water and milk are better when chewed and mixed with the mouth juices before swallowing. It is silly, however, to be an extremist about chewing food. We knew a man who always chewed every mouthful at least thirty times, but he is dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We must make a distinction between hunger and appetite. Hunger is the legitimate craving for food; it accompanies good health, and-dictates with remarkable accuracy the needs of the system. Hunger is described as a “pleasant anticipation of a pleasure about to be enjoyed”. The gnawing in the stomach is not hunger, but is caused by acids resulting from the satisfying of a false appetite. This gnawing is temporarily relieved by adding fuel to an already overloaded furnace. These acids may be neutralized by taking a small teaspoon level full of baking soda. This information is given so that you may prove whether you are supplying the needs of hunger or the gnawing of a false appetite. But baking soda is injurious to the stomach, and the dose should not be repeated often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">True hunger has for its guide a true sense of taste and smell; and in the normal condition there will also be a readier response of the mouth and gastric juices to take care of the intake of food and to make proper disposition for the needs of the body. Hunger is satisfied only with digestible foods. Appetite is abnormal and is satisfied only with a full stomach. The evil practice of being overstuffed with delicacies which tickle the palate causes an unnatural craving which is insatiable. The sense of taste becomes unreliable, and the sense of smell loses its keenness; nothing tastes right unless seasoned with condiments; the system is overtaxed in an effort to manufacture the digestive fluid, to dispose of the overload; assimilation is impaired; and the eliminating system is clogged. Hunger manifests itself in conjunction with a clear tongue; appetite, with a coated tongue. When hunger is absent, food should not be taken. It is better to wait for returning hunger; for the selective sensations of taste and smell are of great value in the conservation of health.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Some Causes of Disease</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-13.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">IFE is chemical activity. Science now claims that every fibre of our being—flesh, bone, nails, hair, teeth, blood, etc.—is electronic. The Bible says: “The life is in the blood.” Oxygen taken into the lungs is taken up by the blood and sets up a chemical action; and life is the result. Take away either the oxygen or the blood, and death results. Life is the highest expression of the transformation of matter and energy. How necessary, then, it is to keep the blood stream pure! Bodily ills can usually be traced to impure blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Imperfect digestion, impure air, and constipation have an influence over the blood for the worse. In fact, worry, anger, grief, jealousy, melancholy, dread, and excitement, set up a chemical action in the blood which is detrimental to the health, long seasons of which result in sicknesses which are next to impossible to cure. The mental state has much to do with good health. The care-free and happy are the ones enjoying the best health, all other things being equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is where the Christian, living close to • the Lord, has the advantage over all others. He should be happy in the divine promises which he has the privilege of appropriating to himself; and if he is not free of all worry and anxiety, he is struggling along beneath his privileges. Implicit faith in the Lord is not only the well-spring out of which develops the spiritual new creature, but an invigorator and healthproducer to the natural man as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Aside from the blood, one of the main causes of diseases is the clogged condition of the intestines. Digestion begins in the mouth, is carried to a further state in the stomach, and is continued in the intestines. In fact, the major portion of the disintegration of food and the distribution of the elements which are assimilated is done in the intestines. It is there that the solids are separated from the liquids, and the refuse of solids passes on into the lower bowels. The liquids are taken up into the blood, and the refuse finds its way into the kidneys and the bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Few people drink enough water to carry on the elimination process normally. Constipation results in self-poison; for the system keeps extracting materials from the feces until they pass out of reach. The use of purgatives is a bad practice, as they cause bowel convulsions, atrophy of the bowel muscles, and irritate the delicate texture of the intestinal linings. Meals made up exclusively of coarse foods—cereals in the natural state, fresh fruits, spinach, figs, etc., with twice the regular amount of water— for a week or so, with a daily enema, will relieve the condition and go a long way toward restoring the bowel tract to healthy activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every animal except the animal man quits eating when it is sick. If man did not have a false appetite to satisfy, he would then quit eating, too. Colds and fevers, aches and pains, coated tongue and an unpleasant odor of body, hiccoughs and belching are but symptoms of a disordered system, the red flag of distress, and the harbinger of the wrecking crew. These warnings go unheeded; the goose continues to stuff himself; and presently there’s the doctor to pay. The overeating vice calls for corrective measures as does no other in the long list of offenses against nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Avoid this by fasting. A writer on this point says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The liver, during a fast, becomes solely an instrument of elimination, and discharges quantities of refuse into the alimentary canal. The secretion of the liver is always a water product; but even as such, it has its use as a digestive fluid in health. When the fast is in progress, the product of elimination is discharged into the intestines, and is nothing more than poisonous refuse excreted from tissue, blood, and organs, which must be at once removed from the body lest it be reabsorbed into the circulation; and this is done by the use of the enema.”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Aids in Maintaining Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font7">XERCISE is of parmount importance, not only when one is in health but also when one is sick, as much as can be indulged in without one’s becoming fatigued or weary. It is essential to the process of elimination. Stretching and twisting in bed when sick is good if one can get no other exercise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Liquids should never be gulped. Furthermore, they should never be taken ice cold or scalding hot. Cool water is good for the empty stomach, and certainly the water should not be cold and gulped down at mealtime. It is impossible to expect the stomach to function properly at mealtime if one makes it a refrigerator at the same time. How utterly nonsensical it is to drink hot coffee and eat icecream at the same meal! Scalding drinks destroy the mucous membrane, and lay the foundation for cancer to develop in after years. Drink water slowly, mixing it with mouth juices, for best results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We should never eat while we are excited, in a hurry, overheated, angry, or terrified. The time to eat is when we are legitimately hungry, and then only when we are cheerful, contented, and can occupy our minds with pleasantries. Hard work requiring much exertion should not be done immediately following a meal. Nor should a person eat when he is tired. Relax for a short rest, then eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regulate the meals as to kind and quantity according to the daily routine. Lessen the amount of intake and correct the diet until you are free from colds and stomach fermentation. Gauge your demands; strike a balance with the intake and the outgo; learn how to eat to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As stomach digestion requires an increased amount of blood at those centers, it is inadvisable to engage at mealtime in weighty matters of conversation, where concentration of thought is required. Mind activity requires more blood in the brain than when the mind is at rest; and if the blood is drawn from the stomach centers, the digestion is retarded, sometimes impaired, and fermentation starts in. At best there will be imperfect assimilation unless the person is full-blooded and robust. Man must learn to live within the limitations of his organs.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>A Few Items ofl iet</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE people of the world, especially in the so-called civilized part, are being robbed of the vitalizing portion of certain foods; namely, wheat, rice, and milk. The fashionable demand for white polished rice causes the miller to take from the rice most of the real food value—the mineral salts which are so essential for the rebuilding of the body structure. Polished rice is a devitalizer and a disease breeder. Its principal virtue is that it makes a good filler to stop the cravings of a false appetite. It is never relished unless it is highly seasoned with sugar and milk; and this fashionable demand requires granulated white sugar, and milk that is pasteurized !</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">White granulated sugar has but little food value; the life and virtue are removed in the refining process. The human system will manufacture its own sugar to supply its needs if it is furnished with the right material. Using sugar to satisfy a “sweet tooth” or the cravings of a cultivated appetite is only to encourage the human refinery to inactivity. And the milk that is pasteurized is dead milk. Dead milk is lifeless. In pasteurization the milk is devitalized; and the vitamines, so essential to life, are destroyed. Raw milk from healthy cows is good fodd. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wheat berry is composed of about twenty ingredients, sixteen of these being minerals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These elements correspond almost identically with the elements of the human organism. Whole grain wheat properly prepared so that none of the mineral elements become oxidized makes an ideal food. Cooking the whole grain wheat in a fireless cooker, allowing it to cool before exposing it to the air, is highly recommended. This method preserves all the constituent elements of the wheat if the tempera. • ture is not raised sufficiently to destroy the vitamines. Wheat thus prepared and eaten with raw milk makes an ideal meal. A little . of it goes a long way; and supplemented with a small quantity of fresh fruits, figs and nuts, it will produce vitality, rebuild the wastes, strengthen the bones, teeth and eyes, and give gloss and health to the hair and beauty to the complexion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But you say that you get your wheat three times a day in white bread. In the milling process of white flour all the bran and most of the minerals are eliminated; and if the germ is removed also, every particle of the sixteen mineral salts is extracted, so that the bones, hair, nails, teeth, and other parts of the body are robbed of the very things necessary to their health and preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But perhaps you get your wheat in whole wheat bread. Vitamines are essential to health, and we agree that the minerals are rich in vitamines. It is well known scientifically that when a temperature of 248° Fahrenheit is reached, the mineral elements and the vitamines begin to go, the vitamines being the more quickly destroyed. A much greater heat is necessary, however, in bread-making. A temperature of from 350°to 450° is necessary for the baking of bread. Hence much of the nutritive value of even whole wheat bread is destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eating bran separate from the wheat is not a good practice. Whole grain wheat supplies the bran in proper proportions, and in a combination that no man can duplicate. Proper combinations of food are next in importance to the selection of the food itself. Prepared or cooked bran is devitalized, having no merit whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE life is in the blood. Oxygen is essential to the maintenance of human life. Carbonic acid gas is developed within the body by the breaking down of tissue. Being poisonous, it is delivered to the lungs via the veins, and is then exhaled in the process of breathing. About 350 cubic feet of air needs to be drawn into the lungs every twenty-four hours, taken in through the nose and not through the mouth. Good ventilation is of paramount importance. Nose breathing is conducive to good health and to a better mental state. The nose is equipped with a system of hairs and mucous membrane for the purpose of catching all the dust and germs that one might breathe. If colds stop up the nose passages, stop eating all starch foods, such as bread, rice, potatoes, macaroni, pastries, etc., and be very slow about resuming them&quot; as part of the diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many do not like to bathe. When viewed from the right angle, bathing becomes a pleasure. The human body is covered with a porous skin. There are nearly 3,000 pores to the square inch in the palm of the hand, and at least 500 to the square inch over the entire body. Perspiration oozes out from the system; and the quantity of water discharged varies greatly, according to the atmospheric conditions, the habits, and the physical condition of the individual. By far the greater exudation through the pores of the skin is invisible. As this elimination process is absolutely necessary to good health, frequent bathing is of utmost importance—we would say at least twice a week, even oftener is better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The skin, lungs, kidneys, liver, and bowels are all parts of the elimination system. To allow any of these to become clogged or impaired in their normal functioning is detrimental. A bath should not be taken less than one hour before and two hours after a meal. No bath should be continued longer than thirty \ minutes in the water, and the water should be neither warm nor cold enough to shock the body. Taper your bath off with cool water, putting the water first on the top of the head, advancing toward the feet, closing with a brisk rub with the towel, and then with the hands. Daily sun and air baths are beneficial. The body absorbs the tonic properties of the air and sunlight the same as does vegetation. The body may be said to breathe; for the skin admits large quantities of air to the blood at the capillaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people run down their constitutions by not taking the requisite amount of sleep. During the waking moments energy is constantly being given off; for every thought requires energy and leaves its waste product to he disposed of. Sleep is necessary for recuperation. The cells of the human battery—and the body is full of them—are recharged in sleep. Relax fully before going to sleep. Have plenty of ventilation, but do not sleep in a draft. Breathe through the nose. Bed clothing must be clean and sufficient, but not too heavy. Never sleep in clothes that are worn during the day. Always stretch out full length. If the feet are cold, warm them and use bed socks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Exercise is another essential. If the daily routine furnishes the requisite amount of bodily activity, well and good. If not, then some system suitable to each person’s needs should be adopted, and followed with regularity; for spasmodic and slipshod methods will do no good. Wear loose clothing all the time, but especially when exercising to permit the free circulation of the blood. All the muscles of the body should be worked out, stretched out, tested out, each day. Brisk daily walks are good. Have plenty of knee action and swing the arms in harmony with the stride. The young may do their stunts with rapid, vigorous motions; but the old must go slower and with more deliberation. When age begins to come on, the arteries begin to harden and lose their wonderful flexibility; and violent exercise for the aged is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How glad we are that the time is coming when Messiah, the Prince of Peace and the Great Physician, will have full charge of earth’s millions and will start the restoring process which eventually shall return mankind to the days of their youth, as originally represented in the mental, moral, and physical perfection of Adam! Then there shall be no hardened arteries; no rheumatism; no adulterated, denatured, and devitalized foods to contend with. Everybody will then know how to eat, what to eat, when to eat, and how much to eat, for the conservation of health; and under the Lord’s direction they may maintain the same throughout the endless ages!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is that coming for the peoples of earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ROM its basic standpoint longevity has in the past been a much neglected subject, as it was once supposed to be rather too deep for</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">human understanding. But through providential leadings in the preparation for the glorious Golden Age scientific research has uncovered many of the mysteries surrounding human destiny, among which are some of the basic principles controlling the span of human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The dispensational message of the day which, boiled down into few words, is “millions now living will never die”, has awakened an intense interest in this subject. If perennial youth is to be man’s portion in the near future, we should know the physical foundation for it and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Longevity </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By II. Sillaway</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the reason why man in the past has been off that foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some without due investigation of this subject have jumped to various unwarranted conclusions which have only a philosophical hasis. The impressions received from these are visionary and unsatisfactory, still leaving many questions unanswered.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Structural Cell Unbalance</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE bodies of all animal life are ma^.e up of cells having a molecular basis. These molecules are in turn made up of atoms of electronic composition. The electron is the common or basic foundation of all matter, which differs in substance or kind through the makeup of its molecules in atomic arrangement and electron formation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The basic foundation of the cells and component molecules of all warm-blooded animals life is the same; but the structure of cell and molecule upon this foundation differs with species. It is this difference in molecular cell structure that determines the longevital span of life as it differs in species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. Some forms of life have a finer organism than others with a corresponding finer cell structure. Of all forms of animal life man has by far the finest organism and a cell structure of such perfect molecular balance as to be capable, under normal or perfect conditions of nourishment, of an indefinite perpetuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The aging process, as we witness it in the lower animal creation, is due to a molecular cell unbalance, intentionally left so by creative design. This molecular unbalance of cell structure leaves a foundation for mineral encroachment of an abnormal character. This process results in a gradual clogging and slowing down of the forces of life, which are finally brought by it to a complete standstill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The aging process in man is likewise due to a molecular cell unbalance, but in his case this unbalance is due to a starvation of the molecular cell basis through abnormal conditions of life, especially of diet. Through the degenerating processes to which for these many centuries the human system has been subject, this unbalance of cell basis has become in a measure fixed, but not hopelessly so; for the basic foundation of perennial youth still remains, and will readily respond to scientific corrective measures.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Potassium Shortage</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HIS derangement of the cell basis of the human system was originally due to an insufficient supply of a certain available food element as the result of man’s eviction from Eden and his cutting off from the “tree of life”, which supplied this element. Present scientific knowledge of the human system and of its food requirements has rendered the identification of this element easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human body is composed of fourteen known elements which the food must contain in their proper balance and combination for perfect health. The office of each of these food elements is now known; and from its action-upon the system it is evident that potassium salts in acid combination was the element lacking which originally was responsible fbr the aging and death of the human family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Potassium is a neutralizer, a waste eliminator, and the chief mineral constituent of the soft tissues. It is this element which gives those tissues their softness and pliability. Potassium occurs in most of the natural food products ; but unless combined with its natural solvent it is largely unavailable to systemal assimilation. Not only does potassium occur in acid fruits in its most available form, but the acid of these fruits serves to unlock it in other foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A deficiency of acid potassium salts in the diet led to a molecular unbalance or vacancy of cell structure, permitting the encroachment of a foreign mineral sediment; and thus aging and death resulted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The normal span of life before the Flood, as recorded by the Scriptures, was several centuries in length. This fact indicates that up to that time the race had not begun to feel the full force of the curse, as it did afterwards, but that on the contrary habit and diet were fairly normal excepting for this one light deficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This dietetic lack was not of sufficient importance to cause disease, as a radical lack of this element does; but it was sufficient to permit the aging process, which could be prevented only by maintaining a perfect elementary balance in this respect.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Longevital Influences</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-15.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">ECAUSE of the fact that most foods contain potential poisons, some have erroneously concluded that here is the basis of man’s dying conditions, and are looking forward to a food which will be free from these supposedly detrimental elements, and which will indefinitely sustain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human system is not materially influenced by poisons such as normal foods contain where the diet is balanced and foods are used in variety and in their proper solvent combinations. In a restricted diet these poisons do become manifest; but this is due entirely to the effect upon the system of the use of an entirely too limited variety in foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Racial longevity in its natural span is but little affected by such influences as poisons, dissipation, or disease, though any one of these may carry off the individual prematurely, and in fact but few live out the natural span of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the Flood longevity was reduced to about one-seventh or less of its former span through the use of a flesh diet. That this great falling off in longevity was not due to climatic changes is manifest in Noah, who lived for 350 years after the Flood, finally dying at the ripe old age of 950 years. It is very evident in his case that former habits of diet were practically unchanged, and that this fact accounts for his length of days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That climate has been responsible for man’s falling off in racial longevity is a theory entirely' lacking of scientific support. This deterioration in the span of human life is directly and unmistakably traceable to the use of flesh foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The assimilation of food is not completed by the digestive organism, as some suppose. The digestive processes merely separate the food elements from their molecular connection, and throw them into the system in the rough, where they are again taken up by the internal glands, principally those of the ductless system, and are by these further reduced to the point where the system can utilize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These glands are the food refineries of the body, and the real seat of life, through which the vital blood stream is manufactured from the crude energy of digested foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In normal foods the waste matter from digested food is not taken into the system, but is passed off through the bowels. In fact, these waste elements are necessary for intestinal functioning. But in abnormal foods of a vegetable character, certain elements are thrown into the system which the refining organism cannot handle, and which are therefore practically poisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These molecules and atoms of abnormal matter act upon the system as hostile invaders, attacking its molecular cell basis with a destructive influence. But in flesh foods, which are also abnormal, we have another proposition altogether. That these foods are of an abnormal character is manifest by their stimulative influence upon the system.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Cell Base Reduction</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE stimulative effect of either a food or a -L drug upon the system is caused by its attack on the cell basis of the system. The effect of this hostile onslaught is to arouse the nervous system to a repellant action. This is done at the expense of the reserve vitality or energy of the system. The seat of hostility would appear to be in the internal glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that the molecular cell foundation is the same in all animal flesh, including man, accounts for the different effect of these stimulants upon the system from that of other abnormal foods. This effect in the beginning was not an influence to break down this cell basis, but rather to harmonize it by an atomic or molecular reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This might be roughly illustrated by the stripping of a fine palace of much of its fine and refined features in interior and exterior arrangement. The same substantial building remains, but these alterations have made it a plainer structure than it formerly was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This reduction of the cell basis of the system went only to the point where it was able to resist further influence to this end, and has not progressed to a complete and harmonious relation between these flfesh foods and the system. This accounts for the continued stimulative effects of flesh foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effect of the reduction of the cell basis of the human system through the use of flesh foods has been to increase greatly endurance vitality at the expense of longevital vitality. This is based upon the same principle that a watch, which is a perfect piece of mechanism, will not stand the rough usage given a sausage mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human system in its original perfection was created to last, but not for rough usage, to which it was in no wise adapted. The use of meats following the Flood was by divine intention, because of food scarcity and the exposures, privations and hardships to which the race has since been subjected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only has the use of flesh foods materially shortened the longevity of the race, but through the creating of an atomic unbalance of the brain cells they have largely destroyed the functioning powers of those cells. In this respect swine flesh would appear to be the worst offender, its apparent effect being largely to paralyze the moral or logical plane of reasoning.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>The Edenic Tree of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HERE appears to be little question that the domestic fruits of the tree order are the original “tree of life” of the garden of Eden. But whether a return to normal habits of life and to a scientifically balanced diet is all that is necessary in the dietetic line for physical regeneration and perpetual youth, remains to be seen, as the clearer light on this subject is still new and, as yet, very few indeed are even making an attempt to follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The majority of people are still using a radically abnormal diet; and probably ninety percent, or even more, are drug addicts in some form. Tea, coffee and tobacco are all drugs, and are rushing the race into the abyss of mental imbecility and insanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No stimulative foods and drinks have any value to the human system in their stimulative properties. In meat the evil effects of its stimulative properties are practically offset by its nourishing qualities. In olden days, when fresh acid fruits were scarce and modern methods of preserving were unknown, wines, temperately used, were beneficial, and their stimulative effects were more than made up for the release of potassium into the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Drug foods and stimulative and refined foods must all be discarded in a regenerative diet, and a vegetable diet adhered to mostly, with the exceptions of eggs and dairy products. Perhaps some forms of sea foods can for a time be used and even be beneficial, as they are rich in certain elements of food value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no question that present dietetic light is amply sufficient for a decisive start towards permanent longevity. In this, fad-dism must be avoided; such as restricted diet, fasting, the selection of special foods because of their supposed vitamine value, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Care should be taken that all foods be used in their proper solvent combinations. This is especially necessary in potassium foods, this element being largely unavailable to assimilation unless eaten in combination with some acid fruit. While the acid fruits themselves contain potassium in its most available form, the supply from these alone is not sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most unrefined foods contain some potassium; but New Orleans molasses, sorghum, and all raw sugars, prunes, olives, and dry lima and navy beans are especially rich in this element. The raw sugars are also very rich in available iron and calcium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a reliable dietetic guide there is nothing better published than a little book .of 57 pages, entitled, “The Required Foods” by Wilson and Burner. The price is 75 cents. Address F. L. Wilson, Bloomington, Ill.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This little book is especially free from fad-dism, and is a veritable little encyclopedia of valuable information on the human system.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font7">OULD God that the Protestant firmness had brought the Protestant parson into disrepute! We would not only be comforted about his disrepute, but be proud of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, on the contrary,- it is unfortunately not the firmness that has made the parson disreputable, but his uncertainty, his flattery of the “Big Ones”, his reeling and tottering in the change of the spirit of the age, his bowing before the power of the state, his aspirations to earthly advantages, etc.; in short, his unspirituality, for which reason the world also disparages the clergyman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All outward display of spirituality does not alter this. True, the clerical garb is worn; but this is just what the world considers a farce. The voice is lifted for solemnity; but to the world it is mere theatrical play. Holy words are spoken of God, Christ and eternal life; but these are hollow, nuts without a kernel. Absolution is granted in the name of God, and the Lord’s supper administered; but in reality as a false prophet and a wage slave. Godly authority is assumed, and yet one has but stolen it or obtained it by surreptitious means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oh, the abyss of iniquity profiteering and hypocrisy which has at all times known to hide itself under the guise of a sanctimonious clergy! This it is that made Dante give popes, bishops, and priests their place in the lowest hell; that caused Luther’s blood to boil; that brought to Jesus’ lips the most trenchant words that He ever spake ; the sevenfold woe, forming a terrific contrast to the sevenfold beatification. “Woe unto you, hypocrites!” said Jesus. <sup>&lt;f</sup>Woe unto you, unspiritual clergymen!” thus we add with a sore heart: but in His spirit, “you are the chief hindrance to God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we say this, it is not because we like to reproach and criticize others; but we do so under the force of bitter reality which we needs must face.</span></p>

If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts, and one shall take you away with it.” “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law [of God] at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law. . . . Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">[Radiocast from WATCHTOWER WBBR on a wave length of 273 meters, by J. F. Rutherford]</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N the minds of the masses of the people there is a great misunderstanding concerning the Millennium. Some who claim to be teachers of the Word of God, and who should have known better, have either ignorantly or deliberately misrepresented the meaning of the Millen-<sup>:</sup>um. They have taught the people that it means some new and fantastic religion by which the minds of men are deceived. The real one who would love to blind the people concerning this, and who has desperately attempted so to do, is Satan, the “god of this world”. When we see the purpose and work of the Millennium we can see why Satan is so anxious to keep the people in ignorance of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our English word “millennium” is derived from the Latin word </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">mille</span><span class="font7"> (meaning one thousand) and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">anmts</span><span class="font7"> (a year). Therefore it means a period of time embracing one thousand years. Our English word millennium does not appear in our Bibles, but the period of time represented by that word is definitely and positively stated in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no period of time mentioned in the Bible that is of greater importance to the people than that of the Millennium. The time has now come for the people to understand its proper meaning that they may profit by such knowledge. For this reason many are inquiring: what is meant by the Millennium?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The plan of God concerning man reaches a climax during the Millennium. Briefly note some of the progressive steps of His great program :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God made a promise to Abraham, which ‘ promise He bound by His oath. In this promise He said to Abraham: “In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” Here Jehovah definitely settles the matter that He had fixed some time future, during which period of time He would offer to all the families of the earth blessings to those who would be obedient. Since the promise is that the blessing is to come through the “seed”, it is manifest that the “seed” must be first developed. And this God proceeded to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The development of this “seed” Jehovah foreshadowed by various types or pictures, in order that when learned the lessons might be understood by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God organized Israel into a nation and gave that nation a perfect code of laws. Among other things He provided for the keeping of certain rest days and years, and arranged that each fiftieth year should be a jubilee, during which year restoration must be made to all who had suffered loss. This was a picture by which He foreshadowed that the time would come, in the operation of His great plan, when He would restore to all the families of the earth that which they had lost, to all who would receive it according to His arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God promised that a great Ruler should come who should direct the affairs of the world, and that His reign would be in righteousness. Some Scriptural proof is here cited: “Behold, the day is coming, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper.... In his day Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this i3 the name that Jehovah proclaimeth him, Our Righteousness.”—Jeremiah 23: 5, 6, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Young.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>The Promise of God is Sure</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HE promises of God are sure, and must be fulfilled. He promised to redeem mankind</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-16.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">in order that, the curse being lifted, He could justly deal with the human race and give, them the blessings promised. In due course He sent His beloved Son into the earth, who by His death and resurrection provided the redemptive price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah then showed that the “seed of prom. ise”, through which the blessings must come, is the Christ, meaning thereby that Jesus Christ is the Head and that the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ should constitute the members of His body, and that all together constituted the “seed”, of which God spoke to Abraham and through which the blessings must come.—Galatians 3: 8,16, 27-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even the birthplace of the Mighty One who should rule the earth, and under whose reign the blessings must come, was foretold by the Prophet in these words: “But thou, Bethlehem Eph-ratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.”—Micah 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prophetic promise of God was that this Mighty Ruler should sit upon His throne and dispense to the people divine blessings. “And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is THE BRANCH: and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”—Zechariah 6:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “both” here mentioned are Christ Jesus, the Great King, and His faithful followers. To those faithful followers, who overcame by refusing to yield to the devil or his agencies, the Lord premised: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”—Revelation 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These faithful ones who are here mentioned as overcomers are the same souls or creatures, that have been beheaded, figuratively speaking, by taking the Lord as their Head, and that have acted as faithful witnesses for the Lord and His kingdom. Concerning them the Revelator says: “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”—Revelation 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the certainty of the period of time, during which the King of glory and His Church shall reign for the blessing of mankind, is shown; and the duration of that time is definitely fixed as a period of one thousand years, and for that reason called the Millennial reign of Messiah.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>God’s Purpose in His Plan</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Bible shows that Jehovah, in the carrying out of His great program, has divided His work into periods or epochs of time. Measuring according to that which is already definitely and clearly revealed, it is certain that the Millennial period was due to begin in 1875. We must not expect, however, everything to transpire at the beginning. The plan of Qod is progressive, and moves majestically and orderly to its completion. The first forty years of that period of time are known as “the day of his preparation” (Nahum 2:3); that is to say, the period of time during which the faithful followers of the Lord are being prepared and gathered together for His work. It has been within that period of time that Christians, seeking the truth, have left the various denominational systems that had bound them by fixed creeds, man-made, and have earnestly and diligently sought the plain teachings of the Lord’s Word of Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of the Millennial reign of Christ is to undo all the evil that Satan and his agencies have fastened upon the people during the past 6000 years. In the carrying out of this program, evil will be banished from the earth, righteousness shall came to stay, and the people will have proffered to them the things they have long desired; and those rendering themselves in obedience to the divine rules shall inherit the blessings which God has provided for those that love Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the prevalence of sin and its baneful effects, the period of time from Eden to the Millennium is designated in the Scriptures as a great, dark night. The prophet Isaiah pictures a messenger of the Lord on w<sup>r</sup>atch during that night and another one propounding this question: “Watchman, what of the night?” And to this the watchman replies: “The morning cometh, and also the night,” ‘if you will have more inf ormation come and ask again.’—Isaiah 21:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus the Lord pictures in prophetic phrase some of His faithful truth-seekers watching for the evidences of the breaking dawn of the new day. These watchers have been rewarded by gradually seeing the light of the new order approaching; and as they have inquired for more light and information, they have received it. With the coming of this new era the people have begun to awaken out of darkness to their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in the year 1874 that the first labor organization was founded, looking to the relief of the laboring element from their oppressors. From that time forward there has been a great increase of* knowledge and advancement for the betterment of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'Although the wisdom of men today is no greater than it was one thousand years ago, yet the great increase of invention, labor-saving machinery, and other devices has made a progress in the past few years that was never dreamed of before. As proof of this I here mention some of the great inventions and advancements made since 1874: Adding machines, aeroplanes, aluminum, antiseptic surgery, artificial dyes, automatic couplers, automobiles, barbed wire, bicycles, carborundum, cash registers, celluloid, correspondence schools, cream separators, Darkest Africa, disc plows, Divine Plan of the Ages, dynamite, electric railways, electric welding, escalators, fireless cookers, gas engines, harvesting machines, illuminating gas, induction motors, linotype, match machines, monotypes, motion pictures, North Pole, Panama Canal, Pasteurization, railway signals, Roentgen rays, shoe sewing-machines, smokeless powder, South Pole, submarines, radium, sky-scrapers, subways, talking machines, telephones, typewriters, vacuum cleaners, wireless telegraphy, and the radio broadcasting apparatus, by which now it is made possible to send the human voice around the earth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Night of Trouble Present</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-17.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">GREE ABLE to the prophetic words of the Prophet, with the coming of the dawn of the new day there have also come increased darkness and suffering. It is a noticeable fact that just before the break of day it is often the darkest. In 1913 it was being said that war was no more possible. In 1914 the darkest warcloud the earth has ever seen hovered over the nations, from which burst forth the greatest death-dealing elements that have ever fallen upon men. Six years have passed since the nations ceased to fight; and yet all the nations are in distress and perplexity, and there is gross darkness in the minds of the people because the leaders in religious thought deny the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All these things are evidences of the beginning of the Millennium. The increased darkness is due to the fact that Satan, the god of this evil world, in his last desperate stand is trying to turn the minds of the people away from Jehovah and His plan. Satan is making a desperate effort to hold intact the kingdoms on the earth, which have long been ruling selfishly and by oppressive methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was to this time the Prophet referred when he wrote: “And in the days of these kings shall ‘ the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”—Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now we see the kingdoms of this earth being dashed to pieces. Many of the kings have already fallen, and others are tottering to their fall. Amongst these is Spain, one of the oldest kingdoms of the earth, with its people now in such a revolt that they are ready to overthrow its wicked king.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Satan Soon to be Bound</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TT IS difficult to find leaders in religious -L thought today who will explain the meaning of the Millennium or tell the people about it. The reason is given by the apostle Paul; namely, that “the god of this world [Satan] hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, . . . should shine unto them.”—2 Cor. 4: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But soon Satan, the god of this world, will be restrained of his liberty; because this is one of the first works of the Millennium, after his empire has been dashed to pieces, as we read: “And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more.”—Rev. 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Darkness, ignorance, superstition, and crime go hand in hand. Enlightenment, education along proper lines, life, peace, and happiness are the very opposite. Notwithstanding the fact that the twentieth century is known as the period of the greatest enlightenment, yet there are millions of people steeped in grossest ignorance ; and crime, and wickedness of the vilest sort are ever on the increase. The ignorance concerning God’s Word and His plan of salvation and blessing is appalling. Even the great majority of those who claim to be teachers of His Word are totally blinded with reference to God’s plan, the chief reason being that the evil one, Satan, has blinded their minds.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Light and Truth Dit&amp;nl Darkness</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the greatest blessings that will come to the people early in the Millennium is a great increase of intelligence and enlightenment. The Prophet describes the Lord’s appearing as the Sun of Righteousness with healing in his beams and declares that He will dispel darkness from the earth and illuminate the minds of the people. As they increase in intelligence they will begin to see God’s way of blessing them, and the mass of humanity will readily respond, and those who love wickedness and hate righteousness shall be eliminated from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people will gradually learn that all the riches of understanding and blessing must and do proceed from God, and that these are ministered to them through the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ. This knowledge will continue to increase ; “for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.”—Isaiah 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the knowledge of the Lord has thus been disseminated amongst the people, then will come to pass the prophetic words uttered by Jeremiah: “And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” ■—Jeremiah 31: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wars between nations and peoples have been due to their ignorance and superstition, induced by the wicked influence of Satan. When they learn that Christ Jesus, the great Prince of Peace, is reigning and that obedience to Him will bring blessings to them, then “many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the kingdom of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” —Micah 4: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the present hour of darkness and sorrow on the earth, instead of trying to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, the rich and the mighty go on in their wicked way of profiteering. They own the lands and the houses, and the masses toil for a mere existence. The Millennial reign will bring about an exactly different condition from this; because Christ will reign in righteousness and break the power of the oppressor. Then they “shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it.”—Micah 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them; they shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. They shall not labor in vain.”—Isaiah 65: 21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the reign of Satan as the god of the evil world, the proud and happy have held the poor under; and concerning them the Prophet says: “And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.” (Malachi 3:15) But during the reign of Christ “all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be [destroyed as] stubble.”—Malachi 4:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In further corroboration of this, the Lord has declared that every one who will not be obedient to the great Messiah during His reign shall be destroyed with an everlasting destruction. He shall no more exist.—Acts 3:19, 23.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>Millennial Reign Will Bring Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font7">URING the dark night of sin, sickness has prevailed amongst the human family. Man has resorted to every known means to stay the ravaging hand of disease, but in his effort he has failed. During the Millennial reign of Christ disease and sickness shall be destroyed; because God has promised to bless the people with health and strength. Through His prophet the Lord says: “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick.” (Isaiah 33:24) Again, says the prophet of God: “Behold, I bring it health and cure; and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.” (Jeremiah 33:6) Then will the drug stores cease to find any one to whom to sell their products. The doctors will no more find people upon whom to practise. But even the 'druggists and the doctors will rejoice because they themselves will be strong and healthy and glad to engage in some other vocation; probably they will till the soil and beautify their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not a day passes now without a funeral. Some loved one has died, leaving behind others to mourn his or her loss. God has promised to redeem man from death and to destroy death and the grave.—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Millennial reign of Christ will accomplish this very purpose. That which is desired above all things else is life everlasting in happiness. Death is the greatest enemy to man. The Millennial reign of Christ will bring life everlasting to all the obedient ones of the human race. A knowledge of this fact is essential to the people. Jesus said: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Again says the apostle Paul: “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” Ang again he says: “This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the [accurate, Gr.] knowledge of the truth.”— 1 Timothy 2: 5, 6, 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus we see that the knowledge of the Lord and of His arrangements, and obedience to that knowledge, are essential to life. For this reason Jehovah sent His beloved Son into the earth. Jesus declared that He came that the people might have life (John 10:10); that He might give himself a ransom for the people. (Matthew 20:28) During the reign of Christ everyone will be brought to a knowledge of the truth, and every one will have an opportunity to receive the truth and be obedient to it. Life everlasting will depend upon one’s obedience to the Lord; because Jesus said: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.”—John8: 51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Millennial reign has already begun. The powers of Satan are being overthrown, and soon the restoration blessings of man will begin. There are millions of people now living on earth who will witness the beginning of these restoration blessings. The Apostle plainly states that during that reign the Lord will restore all things, concerning which all the holy prophets foretold. Each one of the prophets foretold the restoration of obedient men to human perfection. In view of the fact that we stand now at the very opening of this wonderful day, and that there are millions of people now on earth who will witness its beginning, we can appreciate the words of' Jesus when He said: “Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”—John 11: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The theory advanced by the so-called savants of our time that man is a creature of evolution, and that he will continue to evolve himself upwards until he comes to a perfect state, is sheer nonsense. Their theory is directly opposed to every part of the Word of God, and denies the Millennial reign, as well as the great ransom sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>The Lord Rebukes Worldly Wisdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ONCERNING these so-called savants, or men who are wise in their own conceits,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250114_files/g_E_19250114-18.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">God’s prophet says: “The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.”—Isa. 29:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If these wise men would turn their minds to the Lord and would use their faculties now to teach the misguided people the truth, they could be a help to mankind. Again says God’s prophet : “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him: and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.” (Isaiah 55:6,7) “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” (Isaiah 55: 8, 9) What a rebuke to the savants!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has promised the redemption and deliverance and blessing of mankind, and has appointed a day, namely, the Millennial reign of Christ, during which these blessings shall be fully enjoyed.—Acts 17: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These promises must be fulfilled. We are today standing at the very portals of the day that shall mark a complete fulfilment. So surely as the Lord has promised it, it shall come to pass, as He says: “For as the rain cometh down, and the snow, from heaven, and retumeth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” —Isaiah 55:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Neither will the world be destroyed, as some have foolishly said. God has declared that He made the earth for man’s habitation, that He created it not in vain, that the earth abideth forever. (Isaiah 45:12,18) He has promised that the earth shall be made glorious and a fit habitation for man, that it shall become as the garden of Eden (Ezekiel 36:34.36), and that this shall be accomplished during the reign of Christ. He plainly says that during that time streams of water shall break forth in the wilderness and desert places; and that these will cause the vegetation of the earth to grow and that earth will be made beautiful.—Isa. 35: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Briefly summing up, the Millennial reign of Christ is at the door; yea, it is already begun. It will result in peace and prosperity, in life and happiness and joy to the people. It will mark a time when weeds and thistles and thorns shall disappear, and when man shall till the soil and shall see it produce the beautiful flowers and the life-giving fruits. The climatic conditions will be changed for the betterment of mankind. Families long separated by death will be restored and united again. Each family of the obedient ones brought to a condition of life and happiness will dwell together in peace, prosperity and joy. They shall be afraid of neither sickness nor death. There will be nothing for them to fear; but having come into full harmony with God, they will with joy and happiness serve Him for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an assurance that these will continue to abide in this state of happiness the Lord says: “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every nian his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.”—Hebrews 8:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God has graciously brought to the attention of man, just at the opening of this wonderful age, many marvelous inventions. Amongst other things is the radio, by which means now the human voice is transmitted through space, even around the earth. In the early part of the reign of Christ the faithful prophets of old— Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and others—will be resurrected as perfect human beings, and made princes, or rulers in the earth. No longer will the people be left in doubt as to which political party to support. No longer will politicians juggle with the rights of the people. No longer will profiteers control the great political parties and elect whom they may desire. No longer will false prophets and preachers misrepresent the Bible, and confuse the people as to what they shall believe. The Lord will speak to the people through the instrumentality of His earthly representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day, therefore, is not far distant when Abraham will stand on Mount Zion and, by means of the radio or even some more improved instrument, speak with authority; and his words will be heard by the peoples in every part of the earth. And as he speaks the message from the great Messiah, the King of kings and Lord of lords, all the people who hear and obey shall live and rejoice in the blessings that they have. Seeing, then, that we are at the very beginning of this wonderful time, with confidence it can be said: “Millions now living will never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a precious privilege of man to tell this good news to his fellow creatures. If your heart has been made glad by hearing it, then tell it to some one else and make that one glad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">K</span><span class="font4"> With issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, R | B “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both SSFS Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>367</sup>We must make up our minds at once that the Bible testimony concerning the manner of our Lord’s coming is to be taken as conclusive. A careful examination of this will disclose the fact that the Bible does establish definitely and reasonably the manner of His appearing. Many have supposed and yet suppose that the Lord will come again in His body of humiliation, the very body in which He was crucified and which has the marks upon it, and that such is to be visible to human eyes. The words of Jesus disprove this conclusion. When instructing His disciples just before His crucifixion, Jesus said: “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.” (John 14:19) Thus He establishes the fact that His faithful disciples will see Him as He is, but that the world will see Him no more. And why is this true? We answer: Because Jesus was raised from the dead not a human but a spirit being, with divine nature or organism. The nature is determined by the organism or body. He now has a glorious body, which no man hath seen nor can look upon and live. (1 Timothy 6:15,16) We have heretofore examined the Scriptural evidence showing that no one of the different organisms or bodies in which Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection was His glorious body, but that such bodies were created by Him for the purpose at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">_ <sup>S68</sup>He was put to death a human being. He was raised from the dead a spirit. (1 Peter 3:18; 1 Corinthians 15:45) St. John definitely shows that the body in which Jesus will appear is not His human body; for he says: “It doth not yet appear what we shall be, but ... we shall be like him.” (1 John 3:2) Jesus is no longer human, but divine; therefore we could not expect human eyes to see Him. He is now the express image of Jehovah. (Hebrews 1:3) Because He is no longer human and has not a body of flesh, but a spirit body, the apostle Paul under inspiration wrote: “Though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.”—2 Cor. 5:16.</span></p>
