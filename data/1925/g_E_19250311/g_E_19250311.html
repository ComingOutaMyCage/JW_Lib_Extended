<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Day of Petroleum</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font7">O-CALLED scientists have wearied themselves in the effort to account for the presence in the earth of great quantities of petroleum which occupy so important a part of the world’s activities and the world’s news at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They have tried to tell us of the origin of oil, and have evolved five theories, some of which are partly right and some of which are evidently wholly wrong. For instance, one of the theories is that the intense heat of the interior of the earth, coining in contact with water, turns the water into steam. Inasmuch as steam occupies seventeen hundred times the space of a given quantity of water, the thought is that this steam, broken up, forces its way into cracks and crevices, the gas gets thicker and thicker, and ultimately becomes a fluid mineral oil. All this is very foolish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If these scientists would give a little real, reverent attention to the Bible, they would find the origin of petroleum plainly hinted at in the very first chapter of the Book. The creative days of Genesis agree perfectly with the findings of geologists that vegetation preceded the higher forms of animal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible as well as the geologists agrees that in the third creative day vegetation was extremely rank. Mosses, ferns, and vines grew immensely larger and more rapidly than now; for the atmosphere was full of carbonic and nitrogenous gases, so full, in fact, that breathing animals could not then have lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Plants which now grow only a few inches or a few feet high even at the equator, then attained a growth of forty to eighty feet, and sometimes two or three feet in diameter, as is demonstrated by fossil remains. Under the conditions known to have then obtained, their growth not only would be immense, but must also have been very rapid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At this period the coal beds and petroleum deposits were formed. Plants and mosses, having a great affinity for carbonic acid gas, stored up within themselves the carbon, while purifying the atmosphere for the animal life of the later epochs. These vast peat-bogs and mossbeds were repeatedly covered by upheavals and depressions of the earth’s surface, by tidal waves and further descending rings of the material held in suspension, resulting in the various strata of coal, clay, sand, limestone, etc., as we have them today.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>History of Petroleum</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font7">IS plainly evident from the foregoing that petroleum is composed of the fats and oils once contained in plant and animal life. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font7">say . animal life also, because it must be remembered that the first animals on the earth were of prodigious size, suited to the vegetation on which they fed. Their remains are more </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">less clearly marked in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is possible that Adam knew of petroleum and used it in the Garden of Eden. It is certain that the “slime” used in building the Tower of Babel contained partly evaporated petroleum. One of the greatest oil deposits of the world is in Mesopotamia, where the tower stood; and it is found that the oldest buildings uncovered in that part of the world are bound together with that form of binder. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, the Lord used the oil-bearing soils, still present and still undeveloped in the vicinity of the Dead Sea, to overwhelm the doomed cities. The text which states that Moses was deposited in a little craft lined with pitch was the very thing that led the Standard Oil Company to locate the oil deposits since found in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Petroleum was known and used in the time of Alexander the Great, the present Baku, Ru^</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">sian, field supplying the oil. Oil was also obtained in Sicily, and burned in the Temple of Jupiter about the beginning of the Christian era. j </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font7">the American continent the aborigines excavated pits along the waters of Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, near where Oil City now stands, the purpose of which must have been to collect oil. These pits are six to eight feet square, and are sometimes as much as twelve feet deep, lined with heavy timbers, and are always along streams where natural seeps of petroleum existed. The medicinal properties of petroleum were known to the American Indians and the Persians before America was discovered.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>History of Oil in America</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE discovery of petroleum, upon which civilization at present so much depends, was purely accidental. Our forefathers needed salt and used it. They dug deeper and deeper for it, being often discouraged because the brines they obtained were spoiled by the black, oily liquid with disagreeable odor which so often came along with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1859, which is now but sixty-six years ago, Edwin L. Drake, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, brought into existence the first oil well ever drilled. He struck oil at a depth of seventy feet. Oil wells are now sometimes sunk as deep as 3,000 feet to obtain the same results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cost of drilling an oil well is $50,000 to $75,000. The area drained by each well is about five acres. The oil is principally found in sand, which seems to be its natural container. It is believed that the best of wells never extract more than thirty-five percent of the oil, the balance being unobtainable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Old wells are sometimes re-shot nowadays, and with fairly good results. The powerful explosives now in use stir things up so effectively in the oil-bearing strata that good flows of oil can be obtained in wells that had been abandoned as dry, or played out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is remarked that salt water seems to have an affinity for oil. Oil men claim that salt water sometimes chases oil for miles and miles through various formations, until finally it is pressed into some closed sand structure from which it can not escape, resulting in an oil deposit. Few oil wells are sunk now without preliminary advice from trained geologists.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Importance of Oil</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">fPHE </span><span class="font7">wheels </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">diplomacy </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at present are all </span><span class="font7">running in oil. Every international conference is proof of this, even though, none of it may appear on the outside. The “Literary Digest” says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It lurks in the background of virtually every problem now engaging the attention of world statesmen. European politics have become the politics of petroleum. Almost no move is made on that chessboard where Prime Ministers disport themselves with fates of nations that is not tinctured with oil.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">British papers are fond of referring to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. </span><span class="font7">Hughes as the United States Secretary for Oil, but their own secretaries have an even </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">better </span><span class="font7">claim to the title. They have done their work with such characteristic British cleverness that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Sir </span><span class="font7">E. M. Edgar declares that Britain has cornered the oil supply of the world, and that in ten </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font7">the United States will have to buy every year five hundred million barrels of oil from British traders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a work entitled “The Great Betrayal” </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. </span><span class="font7">E. H. Bierstadt declares:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The trail of oil leads not only through the doors of the Department of the Interior and into the Navy Department, but straight to the Department of State as well. Naval reserve oil, Mexican oil, and Mesopotamian oil are all threads of the same web. Touch one, and the rest will quiver.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Bierstadt declares that it was the lust for oil that caused Great Britain, the United States, France, Russia, and Italy to betray Greece and to cripple the great philanthropic investment in Turkey. It was their aim, so he .maintains, to control the oil resources for the next war, and so dominate the Near East peninsula. But he adds that “whichever nation gets into the lead will have the others on its trail like a pack of wolves”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The real secret of the unbending hostility of -the United States Department of State to a recognition bf the Soviet arrangement in Russia is declared to rest in the fact that the Standard Oil Company bought out the Swedish Nobel Oil Company interests at Baku, Russia (the largest oil field in the world); and that the Soviet refuses to recognize the claim, but insists on keeping these richest oil wells for the benefit of the Russian people.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Wasting What We Have</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HILE other governments and other countries are making desperate efforts to get and to hold oil deposits, Uncle Sam seems bent on squandering every last pint that lies beneath the soil anywhere between the two oceans. We do not refer merely to the Teapot Oil Dome and other naval reserves. The rush to get the oil out of the ground and to turn it into money is characteristic of the land where the object of worship of nearly all the people is really and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">truly </span><span class="font7">the Almighty Dollar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whenever a crowd of highwaymen manage to steal a million dollars there are a million reasons, in the / minds of certain lawyers and judges, 'why nothing but honor should be bestowed upon them. It has been so with the Teapot Dome and other naval reserve oil leases. Without doubt the man who made the leases ■was told that he would be protected; and he has been, and will be. The Government has made three attempts to prove criminality regarding these leases; but the courts nullified one of the attempts, and for some reason or other both of the other attempts failed; Meantime, the oil which really belongs to the people is being given away, to all intents and purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pouring of the people’s oil into the market, together with a rush on the part of other producers to pump their oil out before some neighbor should get it, has led to a surplus of oil in the last two years, which means a great loss to the country as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Surplus oil is considered a white elephant. It requires expensive containers, and the loss from evaporation is high. When stored in open tanks, the most valuable part of the oil is lost by evaporation. How much more sensible to let the oil remain where the Lord put it, until it is needed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effect of the situation is that the United States is now providing about seventy percent of all the oil used in the world, and yet has in reserve only about twenty years’ supply, while other nations have seven times as much. The annual production of oil is now worth four times all the gold produced in the world.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Distribution of Oil</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE before us a map showing the distribution of the oil deposits of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It shows that oil is to be found in almost every </span><span class="font7">country in the world. Examining the map mors closely, we may outline twelve gigantic fields or areas which seem to be impregnated with oil:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. A belt a thousand miles wide and three thousand miles long on the axis of Tampico, Beaumont, Shreveport, Cairo, Fostoria, and Quebec. The seaboard, except Nova Scotia, seems to be without oil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. A belt fifteen hundred miles wide and four thousand miles long, resting on Cairo and the Persian Gulf and extending north to the Arctic Circle, on the axis of Mosul and Baku.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. A belt twenty-five hundred miles wide and five thousand miles long, including the Dutch East Indies, Philippines, Japan, Sakhalin, Korea, China, Burma, and Siam.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">4. A circular belt two thousand miles in diameter, including Rumania, Algeria and all the countries between, to and including the British Isles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">5. A belt five hundred miles wide following the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains four thousand miles to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, from the northern edge of New Mexico.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">6. A narrow belt two thousand miles long, from the tip of Southern California to the shores of Puget Sound. .</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">7. A circular belt fifteen hundred miles in diameter around the edges of the Caribbean Sea, on all sides.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">8. A narrow belt three thousand miles long on the axis of the Andes, the whole length of South America.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">9. A belt a thousand miles wide and upwards of three thousand miles long, including all of New Zealand and Tasmania and the southern and southeastern shores of Australia.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">10. A narrow belt twenty-five hundred miles long, from Liberia to Angola on the West Coast of Africa.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">11. A narrow belt fifteen hundred miles long, from Victoria Nyanza to the upper part of Madagascar. A similar belt in northwest India.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">12. A belt of undetermined width stretching across southern Alaska and the extreme northeastern portion of Siberia.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Scientists do not like the idea that the world’s supply of hydrocarbons is being used for fuel. These may sometime be needed for food. A gusher may be spectacular, thrilling and aweinspiring; but to the scientist it is a calamity, a dreadful waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increased use of fuel oil is killing off ... millions of fish that now can not come near the cities which they once visited in search of food. The greatest cause of oil pollution is the discharge into the harbors of water that was stored in empty oil tanks for ballast. The British do not allow the dumping of this oily water inside the three mile limit. The Japanese do not allow it to be dumped at all. They save and use it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Petroleum in Shales</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">GOTLAND has been a producer of petroleum for seventy years; but the oil comes</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250311_files/g_E_19250311-2.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">from shales, front which it is obtained by roasting. It is believed that these oil-soaked shales are nothing more nor less than clays impregnated with countless bodies of fish, which were caught in the descent of the various rings that once surrounded the earth. In many places the shales bear evidence of the remains of millions of fishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Scotch shales contain about twenty-five gallons of oil to the ton. Similar shales are widely scattered over Australia, Russia, and other countries. In the, United States there are billions of tons of such oil-soaked shales, some of them containing as high as ninety gallons of oil to the ton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The roasting of shales is expensive. It requires an expenditure of about one. and one-half million dollars for the construction of a plant before a dollar’s worth of oil can be obtained. Hence the present method of drilling for oil will probably continue here as. long as oil is obtainable by that method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But when the pool oil gives out, it may be safely asserted that there is enough shale oil left to last at least a thousand years, so geologists tell us. Shale oil is produced in Sweden and Germany, as well as in Scotland. The Germans are also taking petroleum from coal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Some Western Fields</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">O</span><span class="font7">NE of the most startling discoveries in any western field was that obtained by the Imperial Oil Company in August, 1920, when a sixty-foot gusher of high grade oil was struck at the mouth of the Mackenzie River, near the Arctic Circle. <sup>!</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, Geologists consider this one of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">most </span><span class="font7">promising fields in the world. There is said to be a large area in which the liquid oozes </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font7">the banks of the rivers, and spreads over </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">surface of the streams so thickly that it can be ladled in cups. 'In some places fires have been burning for years, where some oil-bearing rock has been struck by lightning. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the summer of 1921 there was a great rush of prospectors into the Mackenzie River field; but as the location is eleven hundred miles from the Peace River Crossing, the nearest railroad point, and the intervening country is a wilderness, the Northwest Police restrained many who would have entered. None were permitted to go who were not well equipped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Throughout the summer of 1921 prospectors were carried by airplane from Peace River Crossing to Fort Norman, eleven hundred miles, at a fare of $1,000; and at that time the airplanes engaged in the service were booked for a year ahead. It will take time to build a pipe line over those eleven hundred miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Mexican constitution of 1857 provided that the oil and mineral lands of Mexico should forever be the property of the Mexican people, never to be granted or sold to anybody. Every foreign concern doing business in Mexico knew of the existence of this constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But Mexico has had its Teapot Dome statesmen, the same as America; and hence it comes, about that back in the eighties &amp;&nbsp;Standard Oil man from Ohio who knew how to speak Spanish got into the Mexican cabinet, in the post of minister of finance; and the rest was easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Senior Enrique Creel, otherwise known </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">Ohio as Henry Creel, made all kinds of grants to various crowds of financiers who wanted Mexico’s oil. But he seems to have forgotten to tell them that it would be the decent thing, for shame’s sake, to pay something in the way of taxes for stealing what neither one of them had any right either to give or to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anyway, xvitli a show of holy indignation, the taxes were withheld -from year to year, while our patriots at Washington were indulging in oil-soaked oratory about our duty to clean </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font7">Mexico. But in 1923 the idea suddenly seemed to break through their minds that it might be a good thing to pay something, after all. Since then Mexico has been comparatively quiet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farther south, it is interesting to note that as far back as 1692 the people of Peru were wrangling with one another over the petroleum rights of their country. This fact shows that oil is not so new as some have thought.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE same Sinclair that trimmed the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">States so beautifully in the Teapot Dome lease undeniably has the money and the brains of a certain sort necessary to get what he wants in the way of oil concessions. In 1923 his companies were given rights for a period of thirty-six years over an area of 500 square miles in the Russian island of Sakhalin; and a year later the Persian government gave the same corporations ninety million acres of undeveloped land, constituting what was then reported as the largest undeveloped oil field to be found in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The oldest oil field in the world, namely the Mesopotamian-Persian-Russian field, is undoubtedly the richest field in the world, and is more or less at the bottom of all the disturbances in the world regarding Turkey, Armenia, Palestine, Russia, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the World War Germany had an ambition to have an oil-burning navy; and all her diplomacy was directed toward linking together all the countries from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf, so that she could get at the Mesopotamian oil without interference. During the war this result was actually achieved at one time, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that in June, 1914, the Grand Vizier </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">Constantinople wrote a letter to Baron von Wagenheim, then German ambassador at that city, conveying to the Baron’s so-called Turkish Petroleum Company the right to exploit the Mesopotamian oil fields. The Vizier forgot that five years previously he had given the same right to Rear Admiral Chester of the United States Navy, acting for the Standard Oil Com</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now see what happened. As soon as the war was over, the great British statesman, Lord Birkenhead, declared that the oils of Mesopotamia were rich enough to pay for the war twice over. When he said this, he was figuring that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Vizier’s letter </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the Baron constituted Britain’s carte blanche to go ahead, inasmuch as Britain had whipped Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But it so happened that early in the war Britain had promised France secretly that she should have the oil; so when the trouble-was over France claimed what was coming to her. Then came one of those famous conferences of Europe’s benevolent diplomats, at San Remo. When they got through talking, France was to get a quarter of the oil, the Dutch a quarter, and Britain the rest. The United States and Turkey were to get nothing.- Then it was that the world at large began to hear in earnest of the so-called Chester Concessions, Standard Oil’s share of the plunder. The foregoing is a brief outline of the real reasons why France backed Turkey in the Greek campaign in Asia Minor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The struggle for possession of the Mesopotamian oil fields is a struggle for the future wealth that is to come from those regions. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font7">present the oil wells of Mesopotamia are merely shallow pits, the same as those which the Indians used in America hundreds of years ago. The oil is dipped from the pits by hand. It </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font7">said that the natives are suspicious of modern methods of taking away their oil. Is not that strange ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The New York “Nation” sums up the situation nicely in a paragraph when it says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Admiral Chester’s concession in Turkey is as orthodox a forward step in imperialism as could be conceived. It grew out of an expedition for the protection of missionaries; it includes oil, copper, iron, and railroads; it conflicts with claims advanced in behalf of the subjects of two other Great Powers, and has about as many possibilities of international squabbles hidden away in its clauses as could possibly be tucked into a single document.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the death of the Russian premier, Lenine, he expressed the belief that the expected Armageddon would be fought over petroleum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">EVER AL of the railroads of the West have used oil-burning locomotives for many years. It was but natural that the water-borne commerce of the world should turn to the same fuel. Oil has some disadvantages, however, namely, fluctuations in price, uncertainty of supply, and fire risk. But these are offset by the fact that an oil-driven ship requires only one-third as many firemen and travels about twenty percent faster than a coal-driven boat. There is a low first cost of equipment, no smoke, small storage space required, small amount of refuse, quick response to overload demands, and no banking losses. Bunkering can be done quickly in any kind of weather and at any time of day. Uniform steam pressure can be easily maintained, reducing the deterioration of boilors. Oil can be carried in nooks and crannies, between double bottoms, and in other places where neither coal nor cargo can be stored. In case of a storm beneficial results are obtained by pouring oil overboard on the weather side of the ship. A year ago there were about 3,110 oil-burning vessels afloat as against 501 in 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oil heating-plants are being rapidly installed in apartment houses, some 15,000 having been placed in Chicago alone. In New York, however, which is accustomed to smokeless hard coal, the oil has been found to deliver an oily, smutty grime all up through the building; and in numerous places the oil plants have been pulled out, and coal is again doing the work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Cape Argus</span><span class="font7"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I found him awaiting me in an enclosure near Nairobi, and the first business was to get a headstall on him. While we were cutting an opening to get him out, the zebra jumped right through the barbed wires of the enclosure, and became thoroughly upset. When we went to adjust his headstall, which had gotten over one ear, he dashed straight for the gate. Knocking out two of the panels, he got the gate around his neck, and finished by turning a somersault, gate and all. Getting to his feet again, he broke out of the gate, leaving only the frame-work. That was the animal we had to lead for three miles across country I While I was looking after the elands, which were also giving trouble, the zebra broke away from the boys; but, being fleet-footed, they caught him again, and tied him to a post. Though this was almost as stout as a scaffold-pole, he pulled it out of the ground. Making another start, the zebra kicked himself free, and charged one of the boys, biting him through the arm and elbow. The zebra was prevented from doing more damage, and later was lassoed by a policeman, and tied to the back of a bullock wagon. All went well for a time; and then the zebra sat down. We could not drag him along: so we had to take him off. When he reached the train, he ran wild again. He was so wicked on board ship that he nearly kicked the panels out of his heavy traveling-box. As a rule zebras are quickly tamed and, after being tethered with quiet donkeys for a few days, are released and herded with the donkeys, and appear quite happy in captivity, frequently showing marked affection for horses, which they will follow from camp to camp, and eventually into the railway truck.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The reader will notice that the foregoing are mostly practical queries. Only once does Mr. Edison broach things spiritual, and that in reference to Martin Luther, which is also an historical query. Hence one could not gain insight into one’s spiritual understanding from the results of an Edison test. Spiritual things do not interest the great inventor, as he has on more than one occasion admitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As some of us who have had experience in pedagogy may know, questions are more easily asked than answered; and anyone at all clever should be able to prepare a list of questions similar in number to the Edison list and quite as difficult to answer. No one can yet truthfully claim to be perfectly versatile on all lines of human knowledge; and no one will ever be able to make such claim until the Great Physician, Christ Jesus, effects the complete restoration of the human race. Meanwhile our time might be more profitably spent in searching out answers to spiritual interrogations. I venture the assertion that Mr. Edison would find it quite as difficult to answer or to attempt to answer the first one hundred and thirty questions in the Harp or God as do the majority of applicants to whom he presents his prepared list of questions. The point is that one should pride himself more in the knowledge of God’s truth— holy things—than in the knowledge of things worldly; “for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.”—1 Corinthians 3:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Upon receipt of the letter we gave it a cursory examination, and wrote to the lady as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mrs. ---------------</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">De Funiak Springs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Sister:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We thank you for your favor of January 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The typewritten letter which you enclosed was evidently written in De Funiak Springs, and not on New Year’s Day but on January </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font5"> The envelope shows that during that day it was taken to some station west of De Funiak Springs, but not as far west as Pensacola. It was mailed in the mail car of Louisville &amp;&nbsp;Nashville Train No. 1, which passes through De Funiak Springs in the evening. It was stamped at De Funiak Springs Post Office at 5 o’clock the following morning. This is probably the work of some preacher, because it is inconceivable to us that- any other resident of your city would be low enough in his scale of mental and moral depravity to do such a disreputable, unmanly and halfwitted piece of work. If you think that you know who wrote the letter, we suggest that you go to him and accuse him of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With Christian greetings, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the firm belief that one of the preachers of De Funiak Springs wrote the forged letter, we are mailing each of them a copy of this number of The Golden Age and citing a few additional items which we think should be interesting to them, as well as, no doubt, to our readers. We address the remainder of our remarks to the writer of the letter, and number the points.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">1. In your first line you should have had a comma after “Brooklyn”, and another after “N. Y.” In writing “N. Y.” you first erred by striking a lower case “n”. In the effort to correct this error, the paper feed on the typewriter got away from you; and when yon did finally get a capital “N” in approximately the place where it should have been, the result was that it and the remainder of the line are about one-sixteenth too high. Work of this nature would stamp you as unfit for work in a first-class publishing house, no matter what else you might undertake to do. To these errors you have added by writing “New Years”. This Judge Rutherford would never have done: First, because business men date their letters in a business way, as “January 1, 1925”; and, second, because, if he had undertaken to write “New Year’s” he would have inserted the apostrophe which belongs in the expression, instead of omitting it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">2. In your second line you should have capitalized the word “Sister”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">3. In your third line, if desiring to indent the name of De Funiak Springs at all, you should have indented it to harmonize with the remainder of your letter. Besides, you should have placed a comma after the word “Springs”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">4. In your fourth line you have indented your paragraph much too far; and the same criticism applies to the seventh, twelfth, sixteenth, nineteenth, twenty-fifth, twenty-seventh, twentyninth and thirtieth lines of your letter. This is an indentation never used by business men, but is such an indentation as might be used by a clergyman or some other person who has no regular useful employment. Business men can not afford to waste their time, nor the time of their secretaries, by unnecessary typewriter movements. In the same line the word “Greetings” should have been followed by a period. To follow it by a dash indicates a slovenly habit of </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi</span><span class="font7">nd. The word “you” on the same line should have been followed by a comma instead of a dash.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">5. In the fifth line the word “light” should have been followed by a comma instead of a dash. Better keep the old typewriter exclusively for copying sermons, pop.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">6. In the sixth line we notice that the “c”, “f”,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“e”</span><span class="font7"> and “a” need cleaning; that the “c” is below the line, and that the “i”, the “1” and the period have been hit too hard.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">7. In the seventh line we would be more impressed but for the observation that the “h”, “d”, “f”, “g” and “s” all need cleaning. Your typewriter needs attention, son.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">8. In the eighth line there should be a comma after the word “edited” and another after the word “printed”. You would never do for a proofreader.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">9. In the ninth line the word ‘&quot;broadcast” should be followed by a semicolon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">10. The “f”, “s”, “d” and “g” are still dirty, in the tenth line.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">11. In the eleventh line they are just the same.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">12. In the twelfth line there is no improvement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">13. In the thirteenth line they are even worse.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">14. In the fourteenth line you should have written the name out as “Russell”, instead of designating such a truly great man by the mere initial “R”; and in any event you should have followed the word or its abbreviation by a comma. We would not have you around here at all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">15. You probably meant well on the fifteenth line; but you smeared and spoiled the line when you made the bungling correction- on the next line below<sup>7</sup>.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">16. When you wrote the sixteenth line, you were working so “feverishly’, to use your own language, that in your anxiety to get Judge Rutherford in wrong you allowed your long left forefinger to get up a little too high on the keyboard, and a little too far to the northwest, with the result that you first tapped the figure “2”. Then you thought better of it and tried to erase the “2”, but did not know how to do so. Again you shifted your paper out of position, so that when you put in the “w” in place of the “2” you g’ot it half a letter out of place vertically and half a line out of place horizontally. We feel for you, and can vision how unhappy you must have been, and can imagine how you probably cussed under your breath, until finally you had executed the bungling botch which we photograph.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">17. In the seventeenth line you made the error of misplacing the first of a pair of correlative conjunctions. Instead of saying, ungrammatically, “we will be not only able”, you should have chosen the more elegant form of “we will not only be able”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">18. In the eighteenth line you started to capitalize the word “them” and at the last moment changed your mind and tried to make it lower case, which is correct; but your mind and hand were too far gone, and you produced a result which is like the Laodicean church and the mule —neither one thing nor the other. You had better stop this line of work now, before you do something foolish and get caught at it. We might say also that your expression “radio broadcasting” is an unfortunate one. You should have said either “radiocasting” or “broadcasting”. To say “radio broadcasting” is like saying, “The La Grippe”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">19. In the nineteenth line our aesthetic taste is still offended by the fact that you have failed to clean your “S” or your “s”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">20. In the twentieth line you say: “We are all so anxious.” Probably so! Probably so! But in the place where you used the expression you should not have capitalized the “w”. We can realize how you came to capitalize it. Perhaps you will be less anxious to do so henceforth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">21. In the twenty-first line the word “about” should have been followed by a period instead of a dash. On the same line the word “July” should have been followed by a comma. If we did our work no better than that, we would expect to “get the air”. You had better keep away from New York. <sup>f</sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">22. In the twenty-second line you should have omitted the space between the word “redemption” and the comma which follows. It looks bad. Try to do better the next time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">23. In the twenty-third line the word “sanctified” should have been followed by a semicolon instead of a comma. You seem rather weak on punctuation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">24. In the twenty-fourth line you misspelled the word “behooves”, ,and it “behooves” us to draw the matter to your attention. You should be more careful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">25. In the twenty-fifth line you will pardon us if we suggest that the preferred form of construction is “‘mailed to you” instead of “mailed you”. Please take no offense at this suggestion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">26. In the twenty-sixth line you made again the unfortunate error of inserting an unnecessary space between the word “shortly” and the comma which follows. A good course in a local business college would help you along these lines. It will come in very well, later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">27. In the twenty-seventh line the same long left forefinger which played you such a shabby trick when you reached for the lower case V on the sixteenth line of your letter, this time led you to the northeast instead of the northwest ; and you landed on the “#” sign. No doubt you meant all right; for you went back and smashed a “w” over it. But it does not look well, son. It seems to bear the impress of the clerical mind, the mind that never learns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">28. In the twenty-eighth line we are still offended by the dirty “f”, “a”, “s” and “e”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">29. In the twenty-ninth line, you originally wrote a certain word as though it were spelled “cpmpleted”. We can see how it happened. You reached for the “o” but went a little too far to the right and landed on the “p”. But by this time you had tired of trying to make corrections in the proper way, it being out of your line ever to correct anything; so you fixed the matter up with a lead pencil and let it go.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">30. In the thirtieth line you omitted the comma after the word “copy”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">31. In the thirty-first line you omitted the comma after the word “truth”. It is a wonder that you did not drop dead when you wrote that word “truth”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">32. In the thirty-second line you signed “J.F.R.” on the typewriter, instead of having the letter properly signed in ink or by facsimile stamp.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">33. In the thirty-third and last line you said “Dictated TDR”; but there is no person of such initials in the employ of Judge Rutherford.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">34. The letters which we get from Judge Rutherford are always faultlessly written. Your forgery is a botch from beginning to end. Moreover, your letter w<sup>T</sup>as folded improperly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">35. The letters which we get from Judge Rutherford are written on the printed stationery wffiich fits the office that he fills. Your forgery was not written on any letterhead at all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">36. The letters which we get from Judge Rutherford are written on a good bond made in Holyoke, Massachusetts, which sells for 8^c per lb. less that the Blandford Bond which you used, and which is made at Mittineague, Massachusetts. The two places are miles apart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">37. The letters which w<sup>r</sup>e get from Judge </span><span class="font7">Rutherford are written &quot;double space”, while your letter was written “single space”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">38. The letters which we get from Judge Rutherford are written in elite type, while your letter was written in pica type.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">39. The letters which we get from Judge Rutherford almost always contain some word or expression which discloses the legal mind. Your letter discloses the mind of a clergyman.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">40. When Judge Rutherford is getting ready to do something, he does not tell his plans to even his closest friends; but the mouth of a jackass always reveals all he knows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">41, When Judge Rutherford really does start something, he starts it all over and not in one town in Florida. Your forgery is the work of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">simpleton.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">42. If your letter had been written in New York on January 1st, it would have caught train number 35 on the Southern out of here that night, would have been postmarked Brooklyn, and would have arrived at De Funiak Springs after office hours on the evening of January 3rd. As it was your letter was postmarked “Jack. &amp;&nbsp;Pens. West R.P.O. Tr 1 Jan 5 1925”, and on the back “De Funiak Springs Fla Jan 6 5 AM.’’ You missed your calculations just 48 hours.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">As a matter of fact, good friend, you are playing a dangerous game. It would not take at the outside more than one day for any first-class man to go into De Funiak Springs and locate positively the typewriter that wrote your letter and the hand that did the work. You are playing with fire, and had better quit and take up some honorable and useful employment. The people no longer have any use for the played-out line of bunk you have been giving them. We have given a little more than ordinary attention to your letter because it was a little more than ordinarily mean. Play the game of life like a man, and not like a sneak. The Lord has no use for sneaks; neither have real men.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark107"></a>Miracle of American Production</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">ITH only six percent of the world’s population and one-thirteenth of its land surface, the United States is manufacturing about one-half of many of the world’s essential commodities, and consuming almost in proportion to its production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following figures, presented by Mr. Julius Barnes, illustrate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font7">erica, produces 43 percent of the world output of coal and consumes 42 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 54 percent of the world output of iron and consumes 53 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 64 percent of the world output of steel and consumes 57 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 49 percent of. the world output of copper and consumes 44 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 64 percent of the world output of petroleum and consumes 72 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 69 percent of the world output of cotton and consumes 37 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 52 percent of the world ©utput of timber and consumes 51 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 41 percent of the world output of shoes and consumes 39 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">America produces 43 percent of the world output of printing paper—the great indicator</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By H.E. Miles</span><span class="font7"> in the Kansas City </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Labor Herald </span><span class="font7">of the dissemination of information and knowledge—and consumes 50 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States possesses about one-half of the world’s supply of gold. It owns almost half the railroad mileage of the world, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">three-quarters of the telephone and telegraph equipment. It produces and uses about ninety percent of the world’s automobiles. With 7,-800,000 railway employes in 1923, her Class 1 railroads moved 423,000,000,000 ton-miles of freight. Our exports in 1923 averaged $13,-000,000 daily. Our total foreign trade averaged $26,000,000 daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To claim that our wage-earners did all this would be as foolish as for the grain of wheat to say to the glass of water: “I, Wheat, sustain life. Water doesn’t count.” Labor would be the last to make such a claim. The point, however, is that labor did its more than full and marvelous share in this astounding production. In its will to work, its energy, its love of service and accomplishment, it set an example to the world. It showed that high wages are cheap . wages; that any nation that would compete with us must, by high wages and high living standards, emulate the United States and cease to look for profit through low wages for labor.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark109"></a>What You Do When You Vaccinate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">f. p.</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> Millard, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">d. o.</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">E HAVE in the human body a wonderful system of circulation, in that it is threefold. There is the arterial and venous circulation of the blood; and there is the third circulation, called the lymphatic circulation. It is the last which here concerns us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lymphatic circulation has a series of channels, tubes or ducts, with a terminal drainage point in the veins on either side of the neck. Associated with the lymphatic circulation are hundreds of glands, technically called “nodes”. Now these nodes or glands are “traps”; and in case of emergency they retain, until sometimes overburdened, poisons that if allowed to escape through the system at once would produce almost instant death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When these glands become blocked and overflow, as they do in extreme cases of vaccine poisoning, the blood circulation takes up the blockage products; and death from blood poisoning is the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an ordinary vaccination, the axillary glands in the armpit will be swollen and tender. The swelling may disappear after two or three weeks, though it may persist for months and become chronic in type, and even develop into malignancy in the breast or the armpit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A case reported by Dr. Peebles (M. D.) was the direct result of the virus traveling up from the armpit, and forming a chronic suppurating wound in the glands under the jaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gangrene of the hand, as referred to by Dr. Hold, an authority of national repute, is another confirmation of the blockage of the circulation by chronic or indurated or even by suppurating lymphatic glands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The lymph flow is as essential as the blood flow; and the poisoning of the lymphatic system simply means the poisoning of the body tissues and organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once the lymphatic system is blocked, there is a systemic disturbance that involves the various organs of the body; and many patients state that their breakdown and ill health date from the time of vaccination, or the poisoning of the body through blockage of the lymphatics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hundreds of persons have died from this</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Said the Robin to the Sparrow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I should really like to know Why these anxious human beings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rush about and worry so.” </span><span class="font7">lymphatic poisoning following vaccination. It is a question whether or not a severe vaccine poisoning is not more difficult to clear than a venereal poisoning. The sores following suppuration after vaccination are almost impossible to heal in some instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As soon as wholesale-vaccination is ordered, we see cases of sore throat, diphtheria, measles and mumps. Nurses are rushed to the scene to look after patients whose temperature has been forced away above normal through this systemic pollution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From a physical standpoint, this nation will crumble and fall if there is not a lessening in the amount of vaccines and serums used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This wholesale pollution has brought about nervous instability, lack of tone, vascular irregularities ; and what else could happen, pray tell me, but growths, cancers, or heart failures!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Particularly note that vaccination for smallpox results in a lymphatic blockage due to an engrafting upon the human of the cells and pus from the bovine. The bovine cell multiplies far more rapidly than the human cell. Such a graft therefore must enormously overtax the human circulation, in having to harbor and harmonize, in a degree, this foreign cell life. The very thought of grafting beast into human is so revolting that instinct as well as reason cries out against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Remember this: Six swollen lymphatic glands in certain areas will make one ill. A dozen will put you on your back; and fifty vital glands blocked may cause death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally: To have a vaccination scar is a reflection on the intelligence. A scar following a solicited vaccination signifies loyalty to medical superstition. A scar from forced vaccination is a brand, a mark of medical tyranny and despotism. I would not be vaccinated and take the risk of complications for a $10,000 draft on the Bank of England. My children have never been vaccinated, and I. trust never will. It is up to the mothers of the land to take a determined stand, and they should quickly end the compulsory vaccination of children. Without compulsion, the hideous practice would soon disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Said the Sparrow to the Robin: “Friend, I think that it must be That they have no Heavenly father Such as cares for you and me.”</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Meditation in a Cemetery</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font7">T IS a warm summer afternoon. In proportion as the sun approaches the western horizon and casts its rays more slantingly, the heat of the day abates. Nature becomes inviting, enticing. I yield gladly, and set out to find relief and refreshment, after toil, in the pure, invigorating outside air. Carelessly I stroll along until presently I come to a standstill at the gate of a cemetery. Here I would like to spend a few moments in silent meditation. I pass through the gate.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Deathly Quietude</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font7">HAT a mighty impression is made on one treading this great “God’s acre”, by the deathly stillness that reigns here! The multitudinous sounds of the town faintly and confusedly penetrate only now and then to this abode of silence. Involuntarily I am reminded of the words of the wise man: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything. . . . Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished.”-—Ecclesiastes 9: 10,5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And again there ring in my ears the words of the Psalmist David, the poet-prophet of the Hebrews: “What man is he that liveth and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?”(Psalm 89:48) “For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?”(Psalm 6: 5) “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his </span><span class="font6">earth; in </span><span class="font7">that very day his thoughts perish.” </span><span class="font6">—Psalm </span><span class="font7">146: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And yet, despite all this stillness, are not all </span><span class="font6">these </span><span class="font7">mounds so many silent but eloquent wit</span><span class="font6">nesses </span><span class="font7">of the destruction to which frail man </span><span class="font6">has </span><span class="font7">been subjected?

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Exceeding Sinfulness of Sin</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpHESE words are suggestive of suffering, suffering long, hard, and bitter. They speak of knowledge of sin’s hideousness, gained through contact with it. They speak of human lives, the pride of which was labor and sorrow; for it is soon gone and we fly away. Surely John Kea,ts was not too pessimistic when he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The weariness, the fever and the fret</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs, Where youth grows pale and spectre-thin, and dies; Where but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden-eyed despair.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Surely man’s contact with sin, whose penalty is death, has been a never-to-be-forgotten and much-to-be-learned - from experience. Fallen man, beguiled, blinded, deceived, misguided! But soon, full soon, man, resurrected and disillusioned, will hold at a great discount the Sa-tanic-Platonic inherent-human-immortality-theory lie, so prized and cherished by the race in the past!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Christendom (not to go further back along the roll of the centuries), think of a Bartholomew night in 1529, four centuries back. In one week &quot;were foully murdered in cold blood, at the instigation of Catharine de Medici, eighty thousand men, women and helpless children, France’s best and noblest. France, “the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt”! “How long, 0 Lord, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?”—Revelation 11:8; 6:10; 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A revolting event. But, but only three and a half centuries past, and “the great slaughter of Bartholomew was put into the shade by The Bartholomew of five years’, as the massacre 374 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">My thoughts go further back—to the centuries when the Papacy flourished. Did not man then degrade that grand gift from God, the reasoning faculty, to devise the most efficient means and the most fiendish implements for providing excruciating bodily torture to his fellowman ? Enough! why go back there ? What a moral collapse, accompanied by nameless misery and suffering, of the present so-called civilized world, “Christendom,” presented itself within the last decade!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">HE suffering which this retrospect reveals is overwhelming; yet for each individual sufferer it was comparatively short. It is, therefore, in its turn put into the shade by that horrible preposterous proposition that the time </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font7">is, and still will be forever, when millions of human souls are and will be subject to “conscious misery, eternal in duration.” Even depraved human nature when considering this blasphemous assertion (witness the intelligent heathen who repudiate it when told about it), is forced to violent revolt against it. Someone has argued that “God is served by appreciation of the sesthetic, as well as by the singing of psalms.” If there is anything in this view, what a pity, then, that so much literature should be soiled and disfigured by this thought, expressed in all sincerity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, it is derisively that a Byron men</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ . . . that eternal fry</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of almost everybody born to die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the contrary, however, it is with telling emphasis that a Dante Alighieri announces the superscription ■ hove the portal of his “Inferno”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Through ne you pass into the city of woe: Through me you pass into eternal pain: Through me among the people lost for aye. . » . Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But they are not only poets who have used hand and head to give their conception of such </span><span class="font7">a horrifying place. I think, for instance, of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Gustav Dore, who used his extraordinary talent as draughtsman to illustrate Dante’s “Inferno” and Milton’s “Paradise Lost”. I think of an honored preacher like C. H. Spurgeon, who claimed that at death the so-called immortal soul would be tormented alone; but that at the resurrection “thy body will be joined to thy soul, and then thou wait have twin Hells, thy soul sweating drops of blood, and thy body suffused with agony. In fire, exactly like that we have on earth, thy body will lie, asbestos like, for ever unconsumed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I think of J. Furniss (his name is suggestive enough), who said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Little child, if you go to Hell, there will be a devil at your side to strike you. He will go on striking you every minute for ever and ever without stopping. The fust stroke will make your body as bad as the body of Job.” “And at every stroke the poor kiddie’s body will become another time as bad as Job’s !!” (This time the body goes with the soul!) And if you enquire at Hell’s portal what. it is doing the devils will reply, “The child is burning.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I also think of the “endless misery” described by E. B. Pusey—“fierce, fiery eyes of hate, spite, frenzied rage, ever fixed on thee, looking thee through and through with hate . . . yells of blasphemy, concentrated hate, as they echo along the lurid vault of Hell.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then these gentlemen assert in the same breath that this is “good tidings of great joy”; that this is the work of Jehovah, in which He will for ever take delight; and that such misery is a just recompense of reward.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">means to maintain his authority! Or can anyone conceive of an omnipotent being who by such a method would force service and obedience and devotion to him? Does not even frail man detest and despise, and quite rightly too, coercion in any form?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oh, no, no! Everywhere creation extols the omnipotence and supreme wisdom of the Creator of the universe. That Being must be likewise perfect in love and justice. The Psalmist of Israel knew this: “The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">mercy. He will not always shide; neilhw: will </span><span class="font7">he keep his anger for ever.” (Psalm 103:8,9) For His anger is but for a moment; but His favor is for a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes; the lifetime of a perfect man—for ever. God’s kindness knows no bounds. The Supreme Being’s character does not permit of His being a Moloch.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>God’s Provision for. Man</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">TA7HAT it must have cost His Father heart, ® ’ filled with unspeakable love, to sacrifice His Son for man’s sin. Yet it is finished. The way of deliverance from the curse has been opened. “The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed.” (Revelation 5: 5) “He hath poured out his soul unto death.” (Isaiah 53:12) In due time, through the merit of this sacrifice, He will deliver from the power of death and the grave all such as are willing to serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even now the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy, dwells with such as are of a contrite and humble spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His justice demands instruction in righteousness before judgment. He is infallible, immutable. His Word cannot be moved nor disannulled. He shall yet “turn to the people a pure language”—an uncontaminated truth. Then all shall know Him, “from the least unto the greatest of them.” Then God will dwell with man, “and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.” “Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” The wise man of old prophetically explains this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect [made so by Messiah’s reign] shall remain in it. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.”—Proverbs 2:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Psalmist also emphasizes the matter in terse language: “The wicked shall return to sheol, even all the nations that forget God” (Psalm 9:17, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font7">—who, after having been resurrected, do not heed His instruction in righteousness. But as for each who does give heed to that gracious invitation, says another of God’s inspired writers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth.”— Job 33:25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ND behold the morning of Messiah’s thousand-year day is dawning, the day which will bring the complete passing away of Death’s reign and Sin’s dark night: “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”—Psalm 30:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And what about the clouds of this day of trouble and distress, which must needs accompany the dissolution by force of Satan’s long established empire of iniquity? These clouds may for a moment hide the blue sky where morning appears. But the King of kings and Lord of lords is present; and in righteousness, He whose name is Faithful and True is now judging and making war upon the religio-finan-cial-political abominations of the earth. Therefore “we give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast; . . . because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.”—Revelation 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Full soon the kingdom of righteousness shall be firmly established upon the ruins of Satan’s empire; “and all nations shall flow unto it.” What avenues of life, liberty and happiness this opens up for the poor groaning human race, the Psalmist rejoiced to see this glad day of the Son of Man: “Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together before the Lord: for he cometh to judge the earth; with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.”—Psalm 98: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ah, that all men would stop to consider that they are rational beings, that they would think and hearken, that they would seek and find— seek meekness, seek righteousness, that they might be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger; and search for life everlasting 1 For Jesus himself made the promise, “He that liveth [when I establish my kingdom] and believeth in me [render himself in obedience to my terms] shall never die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The time is come; and millions now living, when thus obedient, will never die. Therefore, “Blessed is he that considereth the poor [weak or sick </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">{margin)} :</span><span class="font7"> The Lord will deliver </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font7">in time of trouble [in the day of evil </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)]. </span><span class="font7">The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth.”— Psalm 41: 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“These sayings are faithful and true” is the seal which Jesus sets to Jehovah’s promises, in the Revelation which He gave to His servant John. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Palestine and Southern California </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Judge Bernard A. Rosenblatt</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">[Member of the Board of Directors of the Keren Hayesod. Address broadcast by Station WBBB]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">P</span><span class="font7">ALESTINE is the' Southern California of the East. What Los Angeles, San Diego and the Imperial Valley are to the Pacific, Jerusalem, Haifa and the Dead Sea region are to the Mediterranean. In Los Angeles I was asked: “But what are the differences between Cal</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">if</span><span class="font7">ornia and Palestine?” and my invariable answer was: “There is really only one fundamental difference, a big difference that we in America understand in concrete form—a difference of about three or four hundred million dollars. When you add to Palestine the amount of money spent upon the marvelous roads of Southern California, upon the mansions of Pasadena and the orange groves of the Redlands, you will have almost an exact duplicate of our American ‘glorious southland’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The comparison between Palestine and Southern California holds good not only with respect to climate and vegetation, but also with respect to area, accessibility, and fertility. From the harbor of the city of Los Angeles to the Mexican Border is a distance almost equal to the distance in Palestine from Jaffa to the edge of the peninsula of Sinai (the outpost of Egypt). From Los Angeles north to Santa Barbara is a distance almost equal to the distance from Jaffa to the boundary of Palestine on the north. Again, from the Pacific Ocean inland to the desert that lies east of San Bernardino, is a distance not greater than from the Mediterranean to the Syrian Desert; and the Imperial Valley fulfils the function of a Dead Sea region. Southern California proper, excluding the desert, is not more than 25,000 square miles; and Palestine, over which Great Britain holds the Mandate from the League of Nations, is not less than 20,000 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to reach the fertile lands of the Mississippi Valley from Southern California, one must traverse the desert of Utah and Arizona. Even so, the Palestinian merchant who goes east must cross the Syrian desert in order to reach the fertile fields of Mesopotamia and the valley of the Euphrates. In latitude, the two districts represent a striking similarity, Southern California lying between 32 degrees and 35 degrees 30 minutes, north latitude, while Palestine is situated between 31 degrees and 33 degrees 30 minutes, north latitude. Palestine is a land of the sea and the mountains; and the two sometimes meet, as at Haifa where the Carmel mountains literally run into the Mediterranean. At Santa Monica, the famous seaside resort of Los Angeles, the mountains meet the Pacific Ocean; Mt. Lowe, towering above Pasadena, resembles Safed, overlooking Tiberias and the Sea of Galilee. The fact is that geographical location, latitude and the presence of the three group factors of history—the desert, the sea and the mountains-—have produced similar effects on the American western coast and on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Traveling through Palestine in the worst season of the year, I saw the sand and the stones in all their barrenness, until I was ready to find fault with those who told us about the beauties of the Palestinian sky, etc. It is all true. The sky is beautiful. A moonlight ride from the Mount of Olives to Jaffa, is an event which lives through one’s life. But after seeing Palestine, I often thought that orators talked so much about the sky because they preferred not to tell of the earth, the sand and the stones, the desert and the semi-desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was therefore with mingled feelings of hope and fear that I left Palestine, until the fears were dispelled by Southern California. As my train pulled through the desert of Utah, from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, on September 23 and 24, I had before me a picture almost identical with v<sup>7</sup>hat I had beheld on July 24 and 25, while traveling in a British military train from Port Said to Jaffa. The same immense hills, the same beautiful sky, the same </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">cold night and hot day. And as we began to </span><span class="font7">near the town of San Bernardino, two hours </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font7">Los Angeles, I thought that I was passing through the Jewish colonies of Rehobo th and Rishon-Le-Zion, less than an hour from Jaffa. In each case, as if by magic, the sand turns into orange groves or fields of grapevines. Of course, there is more of it in Southern California ; but that is the difference of the several hundred million dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Palestine, one of the most pleasant of all </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font7">experiences w<sup>r</sup>as the trip from Haifa to Tiberias, on the highway leading past the city of Nazareth. The whole road is a ridge of mountains and below is the Valley of Esdrelon, the famous Emek Jesreel, like an immense upturned saucer. Descending from Mt. Lowe and Mt. Wilson, in Southern California, the traveler secs another Armageddon, only this time it is the valley in which Los Angeles is located. The big physical difference between the two sections is that in Southern California we miss the Lake of Tiberias, the Jordan and the Dead Sea, a fact which brings to mind that so-called “arid” Palestine has far more water than has the district of which Los Angeles is the metropolis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An old resident in Los Angeles said to me: “If all the people of Southern California should fall asleep for a period of two weeks, the country would return to its native state—the southwestern extension of the “Great American Desert. Every plant and every flow’er in Southern California requires the constant care and the well-regulated toil that only a high civilization can command.” And yet the people who could remake Palestine have been asleep not for two weeks, but for nearly 2,000 years. Everyone in Los Angeles subscribed to my statement that Southern California is a “man-made country”; that it. was, literally, made when the capital of the East met the energy of the West. Furthermore, as capital is always timid, the Westerners had to hustle in order to induce money to come into their country, so that Los Angeles has become the land of the “booster”, and is knowm as the “boomed” town par excellence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And this is just as it should be; for Southern California could have been redeemed from the desert only through large investments and by tremendous effort. In the fertile valleys of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">East, and on the prairies of Illinois and Kansas, the individual settler erected his shack in </span><span class="font7">the olden days; and gradually, as he saved his income from crop after crop, he was able to build a fine home, to buy a car and to invest his money in banks and life insurance companies, which, in turn, used their funds to build up the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But such a plan is impossible, is unthinkable, in a desert or in an arid region; for the initial investment required in bringing water (without which everything else is truly built on sand), means an outlay which can come only through a group of capitalists or a much larger group of many thousand settlers, working in cooperation. Southern California had the good fortune to secure both of these agencies; for an enlightened, vigorous and able group of Western Americans united their municipal governments, their chambers of commerce, and their many industrial clubs to induce Eastern capitalists to make large investments in their district. And so they were able to bring down water from the mountains to Los Angeles, to build an artificial harbor at San Pedro, to concentrate three transcontinental railroads in Los Angeles, to build the famous resorts of Pasadena, Santa Monica, and Santa Barbara, etc. In every case, money had to be spent for years before the possibility of any return on the investment. But when profits began to come in, acres that were formerly worth one dollar each are now covered with orange groves valued at $1,000 and more per acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The identical problem exists in Palestine. Anyone who thinks the task an easy one should talk—as I have talked—to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">pioneer in Los Angeles, who has lived in Southern California for fifty-three years. He told me that the task seemed impossible, and that only American energy and American money could have conquered in so short a time; for he recalled that thirty years ago most of the country was still a desert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Southern California drew on America, so will Palestine, the land sacred to three religions, draw on the whole world. A beautiful California offered to the civilization of the West not only a health-giving climate but also interest and dividends. Even so will the Holy Land offer to the world not merely spiritual, beauty but also material rewards which will be measured in dollars and cents. The Land of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Promise will soon begin to redeem its promise.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The words of that glorious song were prophetic. Their importance may be approximated when we call to mind that for more than 1900 years the entire groaning creation of earth has waited for their fulfilment. The importance of the message is magnified when we remember that during all those 1900 years, and many centuries prior thereto, the Almighty God of heaven has been making ready for the full tangible expression and manifestation of what was prophesied in that angelic anthem.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE better we understand Jehovah’s plan, the more fully we appreciate the fact that lie has the most wonderful of all organizations. His majesty and dignity preclude Him from giving direct attention to the details and the execution of His orders. From Uis eternal throne in the highest heaven He exercises His power as He may will. In the offices of His heavenly courts there are different creatures, as indicated by their names. Some are called cherubim, some seraphim, and some angels. It may be properly said that the angels are messengers and executive officers of the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s revealed record shows that He sends angels on important missions as His messengers and ambassadors, to represent His cause and to act as executive officers in the carrying out of Uis holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When God expelled Adam and Eve from Eden, He put the cherubim on guard to see that His decree was enforced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Abraham dwelt in the land of the Chaldees he received a message from God to go into the land of Canaan. That message was brought to him by God’s holy angel. Abraham was obedient to the command, and went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Abraham dwelt on the plains of Mamre God sent His angelic messenger, directing Abraham to offer his son Isaac. Abraham journeyed to the present site of Jerusalem for that purpose. When, obedient to God’s will, Abraham was about to offer up Isaac, twice the angel of God called to him out of heaven, commanding him what he should do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When God prepared to execute His just decree against Egypt and her first-born, Tie sent His angel as His executive officer to perform this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the children of Israel were fleeing </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font7">of Egypt from the wrath of Pharaoh, and when they were seemingly entrapped and were </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">about </span><span class="font7">to be destroyed on the shore of the Red Sea, the angel of the Lord, as the officer of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Almighty God, majestically'went before the people of Israel and led them to safety.—Exodus 14:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font7">HE proof is conclusive that for many centuries Jehovah had been dealing -with the people of Israel, communicating with them, giving them the Law, guiding and directing them in the course which they should take, using them to make shadows and pictures of future things to come; and that in all of His ministrations He had been using angels in an official or representative capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the hour approached for the happening of the greatest event of the ages. He who shall be the great King of kings and the Redeemer of man was about to be brought forth upon the earth. Surely it is to be expected that God would use His good angels in connection with this, the greatest of all events; and that these angels, in the performance of this duty, would be filled with ecstasy and delight. It was a c</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">limax </span><span class="font7">in their official life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It should thrill the heart of man to realize and appreciate that angels are not mere myths, but are mighty creatures, acting in an official capacity in carrying out God’s orders; and that men who devote themselves to the Lord are privileged to be used with these invisible and mighty ones. Of course, the word &quot;angel” means messenger, and may be applied to earthly creatures, also. Therefore the earthly and the heavenly may work in exact harmony, both to the-Lord’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It did not please God to ^ave His beloved Son born in the greatest city of the world. Satan would have claimed the honor. But God made the place of His beloved Son’s birth celebrated in the hearts of all those who love him. Bethlehem, a quiet little town lying to the south of Jerusalem, was selected. There Jehovah had caused some types or pictures to be made, foreshadowing the coming of greater events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bethlehem was once the home of Boaz, whose fields the beautiful Ruth gleaned, which fields and Ruth Boaz redeemed, and afterwards he married her. (Ruth 4:1-10) Thus the Lord Jehovah pictured how Jesus would first redeem the Church as His Bride and marry her, and that the redemptive price would extend to all the peoples of the earth. God made this place sacred to the hearts of the Jews. He had foretold the place of birth through His prophet.— Micah 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Away to the north lay the little despised town of Nazareth. It was the home of the humble carpenter, Joseph. He was espoused to Mary, a descendant of David. The angel of the Lord had already informed Joseph and Mary what would transpire. The day of the birth of the child God had timed to fit exactly the surroundings and conditions. The Romans were in control of Palestine. The haughty ruler had issued a decree that all peoples should be taxed, and that each individual should report at a certain place for registration. Joseph and Mary must go to Bethlehem. The long and tedious journey was undertaken. The woman, heavy-burdened with child, sat upon the back of an ass. Joseph, with his staff, walked by her side, and toiled over the rugged hills on to the south to the place about to be made the most noted on-earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arriving at Bethlehem, they found the town crowded and all places of accommodations occupied. Applying at one place after another they were turned away. Finally they w’ere forced to take shelter in a place provided for the cattle. There they lay down to rest for the night. All Israel was in expectancy of the event about to transpire. Since the days of Abraham and the promise God had made to him they had looked for the coming of the Messiah. Each devout mother of Israel hoped that she might be thus honored to give birth to that child.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>The Birth and the Witnesses &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">TT did not please Jehovah to have His beloved</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Son brought into the world amidst the blare of trumpets and the tramp of the military hosts. He did not choose to have the humble city of Bethlehem decorated with flags and banners. All the preparations that earth could have made, all the pomp and glory that man could have produced, would have been but a tawdry tinsel and sham, tending only to detract from the glorious thing about to transpire. God purposed that the devil should take no credit out of the birth offihis mighty Seed of Promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For centuries Jehovah had been preparing for this great event, and with each successive step He had used His angelic officer to mark the way. Now He sent a special angelic messenger, a minister plenipotentiary, to the earth to make announcement and to give witness to the earth of the coming of the great Redeemer. It was in the night time, picturing how the entire world lies in darkness and sin and death. The great Light was about to come into the earth and to shine into the minds and hearts of those who were humble and ready to receive it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The poverty of Joseph and Mary was befitting, and in strong contrast with the glorious heavenly players in this mighty drama. What a great thrill must have gone through the creatures of heaven! All the heavenly host must have been on the alert as to what was now about to transpire. The specially honored messenger moved forward to his position of vantage. At the given moment this angelic officer stood forth and delivered his message, which has thrilled the hearts of millions of people down through the age. With authority he said: “Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.”—Luke 2: 10,11. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This angelic officer was not alone. God had provided him with an angelic train, a mighty host to accompany him to earth on his wonderfid mission. With befitting dignity these stood by until the honored officer had delivered his message; and then this great multitude of heavenly creatures stood forth, praising God as they sang: “Glory to God in the highest, and oi! earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the creation of man no event compared</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to this had transpired. Mark well whom the Lord chose for His earthly witnesses to establish the fact in the minds of men. The Pharisees and the financiers, the lawyers and the priests, the wise men, big business, big politicians and big preachers who ruled Israel— not one of these was honored by being asked to witness to the birth of the Master. The reason why is that they were a part of the devil’s organization. God honors them that honor Him. To please God we must worship Him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A little band of shepherds had brought their flock to a hillside across the ravine to the east of Bethlehem. These were humble men, earning an honest living. They trusted the Lord and the promises He had made to father Abraham. They had brought their sheep into the corral, and there kept one of their number on watch to guard the flock from the wild beasts while the others slept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The angel of the Lord appeared unto them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them. Evidently the reflected glory of the Lord, sent forth from His angel, attracted their attention; for they all were awakened and listened to the message delivered by this heavenly officer. These shepherds humbly hurried forward to see the child and to relate their testimony to others. They took no credit to themselves. Had they belonged to the devil’s organization they would have swaggered about and said: Behold, what honored men we are. Look up to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the contrary, the shepherds gave glory to God and praise unto Him for all the things that they had heard and seen, and that were told them. This is in exact harmony with all of God’s arrangements. God resists the proud, and shows His favor to the humble-minded. (1 Peter 5: 5) AU of His intelligent creatures should learn a lesson from this. He that exalts himself shall be abased, but he that humbly submits himself to God’s holy will in due time shall be exalted.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>The Great Conspiracy</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19250311_files/g_E_19250311-14.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">ID not God send three wise men from the East to be witnesses to the birth of His beloved Son? Should not we revere the memory of these three wise men? Herein has that old serpent, Satan, deceived the people. He has kept prominently before- the minds of the people the three wise men as though they were sent of God. To answer the above questions properly we must look for a moment at Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah uses good angels. Satan, the devil, is a mimic god. He first deceived and drew after him a number of the angels of heaven, who became evil; and these the devil uses in his organization to blind the people to God’s plan of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan knew that God had declared that the “seed of promise” should bruise the head of the serpent and his seed, and that the promised seed should bless all the families of the earth. Satan, through his emissaries, set out to destroy this seed. He had been in Eden, the garden of God; and from the time Adam was driven therefrom Satan has resorted to every known means to destroy those who have striven to be obedient to the Lord. He sought to have Sarah debauched and Abraham killed. He attempted the death of Jacob by Esau, and incited Saul to kill David. He caused the persecution of all the prophets. He sought the death of Mary and the unborn babe. From all these wicked attempts God protected His own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The so-called wise men were astrologers </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">soothsayers who lived in the East, doubtless Persia, well known to be of those who communicate with evil spirits. They saw a light rise to the west, and were instructed by an unseen power to follow this light. This light was called </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">star, but stars do not move about in this manner. The devil and his angels exercise this power even today, and cause lights to move about to deceive others. These wise men were dupes of the adversary and his angels, therefore readily fell into the conspiracy. They did not go directly to Bethlehem, where they would have gone if God had sent them. They first went to Jerusalem and presented themselves to Herod. And why? Because Herod belonged to the devil, as his prior and subsequent acts show. The devil knew that Herod would want to kill the babe; therefore he drew these wise men into the conspiracy with Herod for the purpose of destroying the babe Jesus. In this attempt God thwarted him, and delivered His beloved child. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To cover up his nefarious work and blind the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">people to the trugi, Satan has induced the </span><span class="font7">clergy throughout the age to magnify these wise men in the eyes of the people and to have Christmas cards printed with their pictures on them, and has caused people to worship lights and stars and the images of the wise men. All of these emanate from the devil.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Angelic Anthem a PropheUc Statement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE rapture of the angels expressed m this glory-song could not be understood at that time. The understanding began at Pentecost, and has been given to the people of God since; and in due course all the families of the earth shall know it, when the knowledge of the glory of the Lord fills the earth as the waters fill the deep. The angels here were declaring that all glory and honor should fie given to God, and that from heaven comes this manifestation of His love for mankind; that while the earth was in distress and sorrow, the time would come when there would be peace on earth, when the good will of God would be shown unto all men, and all who were of right condition of heart would receive it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The song was a prophetic one; for it foretold events to happen in the future. It was in harmony with what God had spoken through th&lt; mouth of His holy prophets long before when He said: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6) Here the Prophet pointed forward to the time when this blessed child, now born, would become the great Ruler of the earth, upon whose shoulders the government would rest; and that He, the Prince of Peace, would bring life, peace, happiness and good will to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus came to earth that He might give His own life a ransom for mankind—not that He might be ministered unto and made much over, but that He might be the minister and servant and die for man’s redemption.—Matthew 20: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let the haughty learn from this that the greatest One ever on earth was the humblest one ever on earth; and that because of His humility and obedience God hath highly exalted Him above all others. God will exalt none other except those who are obedient to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The birth, death, and resurrection of the Lord opened the way that mankind might have life; and that those who are of the Body of Christ might have life more abundantly.—John 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s plan has majestically moved forward with exactness and precision. “Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning.” (Acts 15:18) When He laid the foundation of the earth as a habitation for man, the Morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. At that time Lucifer was i. harmony with Jehovah, and doubtless was one of the Stars. The Morning Star is clearly marked out in Revelation as Christ Jesus. (Revelation 22:16) When He, as the active agent for Jehovah, prepared the place for man’s habitation, all the angels of heaven shouted for joy. —Job 38: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the unfolding of the great drama of creation from Eden to John the Baptist, the angels performed their respective parts. When Jesus left the heavenly courts and became a man, the angels knew that this was a progressive step in the divine plan; and all the hosts of heaven sang together for joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the thousand years have ended, and Jesus has fully preformed His work of restoring the obedient ones of earth, then He will take a retrospective view; and He will see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied. (Isaiah 53:11) Then to Him every knee shall bow, everything in heaven and on earth; and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Philippians 2:19,11) The Psalmist says that then all the angels of heaven will praise Him; that the sun, the moon and the stars will praise Him; that all creation will sing His praises.—Psalm 148.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>SS9</sup>His last message to the disciples just before His ascension on high clearly indicated a time coming when the watchers would know. He said unto them: “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive power, after that the holy spirit is come upon you.” (Acts 1:7, 8) Those who are begotten of the holy spirit have the promise that the Lord will reveal to them His great truths when due to be understood. (1 Corinthians 2:9,10) These are they that walk in the light, and for them the light shines with increasing brilliancy unto the perfect day. In harmony with this, St. Paul wrote: “Of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape, ’ut ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.” (1 Thessalonians 5:1-4) Plainly the Apostle tells the followers of Jesus that if they are watching the things which the Lord told them to watch, the day of the Lord will not come upon them una.-wares, but they will mark the fulfilment of prophecy, and in the light of its fulfilment they will discern the time of the presence of the great King. Furthermore he says to them: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.”—1 Thessalonians 5:5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8M</sup>We shall find that Jesus gave much evidence which enables the w’atcher to determine the Lord’s presence. Jesus spoke in prophetic language. Prophecy means a foretelling of future events before they take place; and when they are taking place the watcher can ascertain that they are thus fulfilling the prophetic words previously spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>S91</sup>Jesus gave us the positive evidence as to when to expect Him. He gave a parable of the ■wheat and the tares, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed' tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”—Matthew 13: 24-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">^Interpreting His own parable, Jesus said that He was the man who had sown the good seed; that the field is the world;, and that the good seed are the children of the kingdom, and that the tares are the children of the wicked one; that the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and that the harvest is the end of the world.—Matthew 13: 37-39.</span></p>
