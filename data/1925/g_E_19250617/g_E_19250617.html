<p><span class="font5">South Pole, determined to discover the North Pole also, and flew by airplane from Spitzbergen late last month. The fate of the explorer is unknown up to the time of our going to press. Other expeditions are headed in the same direction, among them the MacMillan American expedition. Knud Rasmussen, the Danish explorer, has just returned from the Arctic regions, where he spent three and one-half years collecting Eskimo folk lore.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> represents Romain Rolland, noted French author arid pacifist, as saying, “I believe that the war has not taught the governments anything, and unless a miracle occurs, which we cannot expect, we are marching with great strides toward a new war that will surpass in duration and intensity that of 1914-18. It is no longer a question of a duel between France and Germany, which henceforth . passes to the background. It will be a question of an enormous struggle between the European and Asiatic races. The Asiatic races will go with Russia, and the European races will undoubtedly go with the United States of America. This gigantic conflict has been in preparation for half a century.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font5">EWS from the United States that President Coolidge had decided that a plebiscite must be held in Tacna-Arica to determine whether it shall belong to Peru or to Chile, so angered the common people of Peru that a great crowd stormed the palace at Lima. The guns were trained upon the rioters and 120 were killed. All mention of the riot was forbidden by the Peruvian authorities and the details are only Bow coming to light.</span></p>

At first the volume of sound was too great and the Buenos Aires newspaper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">La Nation</span><span class="font5"> asked that the music and speaking be modulated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font11">D</span><span class="font5">URING the past four years, on one stretch of the British east coast only 50 miles long, 35 villages have been abandoned. The ocean is advancing at the rate of 15 to 20 feet a year and there does not seem to be any possible way of preventing it. This part of England is gradually sinking into the sea, while their west coast is rising.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Personalities in Parliament</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE British parliament recently spent a day discussing the proposition that the only solution of present ills is the social ownership and democratic control of the staple industries and the banking system. In the discussion a Tory leader remarked that there were Russians in the city and that their appearance did not create much confidence. A Labor leader retorted, ‘'They are as good looking as some of your foreigners. Look at your king and queen —its not so long since they came from Germany”, thus reminding his hearers that it is only recently that the German family name, Wet-tin, was abandoned for the English name of Windsor. It is but a little time since the German tongue was chiefly spoken at Windsor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vienna Girls Show War Strain</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">V</span><span class="font5">IENNA girls show the strain which has been brought upon them by the horrible war and post-war conditions. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> reports that 55 percent of the Vienese girls quitting school between 14 and 15 years of age are physically unable to work for a living, and that 18 percent of them have tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">France’s New War Monsters</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE London Daily </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font5"> reports that the French government is to build new cruisers of 17,500 tons capacity, with a speed equal to 39 miles per hour, and an armament such that they can easily run down and sink any of the 10,000 ton cruisers now being built by Great Britain, the United States or Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Where the Ballast Saved the Ship</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE great British airship R-33 was saved from destruction when it had its nose pulled out by the roots in the great storm and was sent drifting over the North Sea. The thing that saved it from immediate or subsequent destruction was that it had two pairs of artillery wheels hanging at its stern, each of which weighed half a ton. After a most plucky fight of thirty hours the crew brought the great ship safely back to her aerdrome. Without the swinging artillery wheels the great airship would have gone head-first into the sea. Airships were not made to travel far with the whole front part torn off and hanging in rags.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How the Dawes Plan Originated</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">T AN address before the School of Business of Columbia University, Lewis E. Pierson, chairman of the Irving Bank, declared that the Dawes plan originated two years ago at a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce held in Rome. He added, “If, as we all expect, the Dawes plan proves successful, the business organizations of the world may take to themselves credit for finding the method of evolving a plan to solve the post-war problem after the statesmen who approached it from a purely political viewpoint, failed to find the solution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herriot’s Government Goes to the Wall</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TpRANCE’S bonds arc coming due. The peo-pie are in no mood to renew them. They want their money, so that they can ship it out of the country. To meet the situation Mr. Herriot wanted to make a capital levy. The senate voted no confidence, and the whole ministry resigned. Herriot took his defeat good naturedly and with smiles. After resigning, he drove away in the chauffeur’s seat of his automobile, amid popular applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Recent Progress in Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font5">N SUNDAY, February 8, a two-way .wireless telephone conversation was carried on between a person in Hampstead, London, England, and some person in the middle West in the United States. This experiment indicates that transoceanic telephony is surely coming soon. Meantime underground and undersea radio communication has been conducted between the two continents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">German Fleet Being Raised</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HD HE German fleet, treacherously sunk at -*■ Scapa Flow at the close of the war to prevent it from falling into the hands of the allies, is being rapidly brought to the surface. By the operation of a German invention seven of the great vessels have already been raised. A dozen more large vessels still lie at the bottom of the bay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Czecho-Slovakia Shares Denmark’s Shame</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T HAS just been brought to light that Czechoslovakia, the central state of Central Europe, and in many ways one of the most progressive countries on the continent, shares with Denmark the disgrace of a state lottery. A wifemurderer, imprisoned for life, has just drawn the chief prize, one million crowns. This sum has been set aside for his son.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">She returned shortly with her husband, hut in the meantime the villagers had been misinformed that a Jewish family had killed the girl to make Matzos. They attacked this family with such fury that one of the family, a little girl of eleven years of age, died from the beatings and the fright. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' <sup>:</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">inston Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer under the present Tory British Government, has proposed old age pensions, giving $2.50 weekly for life, to widows, and $1.00 per week to each of her children; at the age of 65 all persons become eligible to the pension of $2.50 per week, without inquiry into their private means. 30,000,000 Britons are affected.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Mussolini Takes More Power</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">TT WOULD be hard to see how any one man -L could arrogate to himself more power than Mr. Mussolini has done, but he has managed within the past few weeks to make himself Interim Minister of War, Interim Minister of Air and now most recently has also become Interim Minister of Navy. Besides being Prime Minister these additional offices ought to satisfy him for a while.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Pope Blesses Five Cases of Merchandise</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Catholic publication </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor </span><span class="font5">of Huntington, Indiana, contains an advertisement of certain parties who have on hand five cases of rosaries, of which they are willing to dispose on certain terms that will be made known to inquirers. The statement of the advertisers is that these rosaries, amounting in number to 28,800, were duly blessed at the Vatican, by the Pope himself, on March 31, 1924. ,We hope these rosaries will bring their wearers no bad luck, but we recall that a previous Pope blessed the Spanish fleet only a short time before Admiral Schley sent it to the bottom of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How About Bibles in Russia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE Chicago </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font5"> prints a story that the Soviet Government sold a large quantity of Russian Bibles to a Bishop of the American Methodist Episcopal Church, and that these Bibles doubtless really belonged to the British and Foreign Bible Society, which sent them into Russia only to have them seized as contraband. Three days later the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> published a dispatch from London that Bibles are contraband in Russia. Evidently the Soviet Government has some sort of an understanding with the Methodist Church by w’hich it is granted certain liberties in Russia not extended to others.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Mr. Hughes’ Most Unpopular Act</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font5">O DOUBT the most unpopular act of the entire official career of Charles E. Hughes was his responsibility for the gagging of the Hungarian patriot Karolyi, who came here to visit his wife in her illness. It is popularly believed that the gag was applied at the behest of the Hungarian minister, Count Szechenyi, who married Gladys Vanderbilt. It was a foolish piece of business, for Karolyi had his full say in Montreal, and his interview was published in all the American newspapers, and there was nothing he had to say which w<sup>r</sup>as not already known in America by those in touch with the political situation in Hungary. There is no liberty in Hungary, and Mr. Hughes knows it well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hungarians Destroy Useless Finery</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font5"> MOST unusual occurrence happened recent-VA.. ]y j<sub>n a</sub> Hungarian town with the unpro-pitious name of Mezoekoevesd. The people became convinced that they were expending more for finery, in the shape of gold and silver brocades, beads and other ornaments, than they could afford. After prolonged public discussion of the matter, they solemnly met and destroyed sixty huge baskets of these materials and avowed their purpose to return to the simple life of their ancestors.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Declasse in Russia</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">oses Eistenstadt, formerly a rabbi in Petrograd, now a rabbi in Boston, tells that in Russia those who are declared to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">declasse </span><span class="font5">are deprived of citizenship and of all political rights, must pay special taxes when and as desired, may not send their children to higher schools or colleges, and even orphans of the declasse may not be admitted to the orphan asylums. All professional men not employed by the Government are declasse and in the Ukraine alone there are 100,000 Jews who have been declared declasse, and are in a hopeless condition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> contains a dispatch from Berlin stating that the Soviet government has decided to return all factories and some two thousand apartment houses to their original owners, having found that they can not be run at a profit by the Soviet administra-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pathetic Condition, of Russian Nobility ' </span><span class="font5">WHATEVER we may think of nobility as an institution, none can but be moved to sympathy for the Russians who fled from their country to escape the Bolsheviki. Unused to working for a living, many of them can find nothing to do. Too noble-minded to beg, or even to become a burden on those situated like themselves, great numbers have suicided as the only way-out of their troubles. One of the prominent princesses thus died recently.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">NEAR Vilna, Russia, early in the World War, a provision storehouse of the Russian army was destroyed by an explosion.

Here and there the women are laying aside the veils which, from time immemorial, have hidden their features from view and de-' prived them of proper freedom and fresh air.

Writing of one such movement, styled the Pentecostal mission, an intelligent gentleman in India says: “The meetings are the most disorderly I have found. Men and women shake, falling on the ground and continuing to shake, in meagre native dress. The sight is horrible! Native women, not sufficiently clad, jump up, shaking their loose garbs in public. Respectable men close their eyes. One of our young men grew wild-mad after ‘tarrying foi’ the spirit’. Native heathen say, ‘We never thought Christian folks had such wild and horrible demonstrations in their worship”<sup>; </sup>Some educated Hindus have said to me: TA there not in this the wild spirits torturing and twisting poor victims, so that they yell out- and cry in unintelligible sounds?

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5"> CUT in the government pay-roll has been suggested by President Coolidge. Since July 1, 1913, it is solemnly averred that all Federal employees have been receiving an increase in salaries of $614 per year, and that this has more than kept pace with the constantly mounting cost of living. The President may have been misinformed as to the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is the truth? Just this: On the date mentioned, according to the Department of Labor, the average salary of all government workers was $1,134; on July 1, 1924, it was $1,749, an increase of fifty-four percent. Living costs have jumped, in the meantime, to sixty-seven percent. Before the war, the salaries of government employees had not been increased for eighty years. The war brought increased prices; and consequently Congress granted a bonus of $240 per annum for all receiving as much as $2,500. There are 66,000 employees of the government in Washington. Perhaps not less than 55,000 of these are paid not more than $265 a year above the amount received before the war. Thus it will be seen that most of the increase goes into the pay envelope of the favored 10,000. Doubtless many in the service who receive a mere pittance will be dropped from the payroll as a result of the President’s suggestion, while the employees who have “political pull” will remain securely ensconced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League of Nations is composed of two non-Catholic delegates from Japan and England, and the remainder is Catholic, according to recent reports, which are absolutely reliable. The Secretariat of the World Court is a Catholic. The majority of the delegates, of course, are strongly in favor of giving their power and strength to the Pope by making him President of the League. Trying to understand the League Covenant is a harder task than one might suppose, from a casual reading of that document. In the Patent Office is the original mode<sup>1</sup>' vf the Paige type-setting machine.' Two mechanics went crazy, fooling with it. Its counterpart is found in the League Covenant, with its infinite intricacies and bewildering labyrinth of complexities.

<p><span class="font5">The scientists in Washington are elated over the success of their observations during the recent eclipse of the sun. Photographs taken at the Naval Observatory disclosed several medium spots on the sun’s surface. It is explained that these are tornadoes on the sun’s immense surface—an appalling vortex in which “whirling electricity-charged” particles “produce an intense magnetic field, and have a direct relation to electrical storms on the earth and the northern lights.” It is thought that the observations may lead to the correction of small inaccuracies in the position of the moon with reference to the planet. A large “spectrum photograph” of the outer atmosphere of the sun, it is thought, will show that it contains helium, hydrogen and calcium. The “spectral analysis” of the sun reveals the interesting fact that the temperature there is so great that iron would “boil away like water and that the solar light emanates from a body yet hotter than the vapor of the iron”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">For some time there has been much agitation and discussion over the proposed development of Great Falls on the Potomac near Washington. The development of this project would supply cheap light and power to the Capital and vicinity, if properly developed; but the Power Trust, as usual, is violently opposed to the measure. Fresh discussion has been aroused in Congress by the introduction of a bill by Representative Zihlman of Maryland, providing for “the improvement of the Potomac River and the development of hydro-electrical power at Great Falls”. Whether the proposition materializes favorably for the people remains io be seen. • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Department of Commerce, the Africans are becoming “civilized”. “American silks are making flappers out of the South African farmer’s daughters,” it avers. We quote: ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Twenty-five years ago the Boer farmer crawled over the African veldt in his oxcart; and his womenfolk, in homespun garments, laboriously drew up water for the stock from the well. Today, American windmills dot the veldt; American motorcars, like beetles, pass from farm to farm; and the women are going in for American silk hosiery and underwear. American types of agricultural implements are suitable to the South African soil, and they are popular. They have the promise of an expanding market, but German competition is coming back strong. If German goods are inferior, their prices are lower. British imports with their preferential tariff of three percent, of course, have a certain advantage, but probably do not greatly affect the trade. Imports of agricultural implements into South Africa from the United States in 1923 were valued at $1,463,000 as compared with $622,000 in 1922, an increase of about 110 percent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are 38,815 motorcars in that region, according to the same authority, ninety-five percent of which are American made. Verily, “the world do move” in this wonderful age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A visit to the Supreme Court Room in the Capitol recalls a bit of scientific history. Prof. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph, told Washington officials in 1843 that “communication by wire” would “with certainty be established across the Atlantic Ocean”. “Startling as this may now seem,” he stated, “I am confident the time will come when this project will be realized.” He lived to see this begun in ’58 and completed in ’66. The Lord used this man, without a doubt, and probably put it into his mind and heart to make these predictions. Morse had a full-orbed faith and confidence in the Lord, and gave God the credit for his marvelous achievement in the memorable utterance taken from Numbers 23: 23: “What hath God wrought!” sending this message over the wire from Washington to Baltimore, and thus honoring the Lord’s Word with “first passage” over the newly-constructed system—the forerunner of many others, as present-day developments attest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Spring of 1844 travelers on their way from Baltimore to Washington, saw a party of men occupied with the work of putting up several lines of copper wire on a row of lofty poles which extended between the two cities. Tt wu the first telegraph line ever built on this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After four long years of weary waiting, the great inventor had finally secured an appropriation of thirty thousand dollars from Congress “for the purpose of proving that a message could be sent by electricity a distance of forty-miles”. On the morning of May 24, 1844, Prof.' Morse sat down at the instrument placed in the Supreme Court Room in the Capitol at Washington. Many of the high officials of the Government were present in person. It was a momentous occasion! He pressed the key of the instrument with his finger. The question uppermost in the minds of everyone present was, Would it work? Would the message go through? Or would Morse’s cherished scheme prove a failure, and himself become the subject of ridicule? No: instantly the waiting operator at Baltimore received the message, and it was sent back in understandable, audible code: “What hath God wrought!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one minute the sacred words of Prophecy had traversed a circuit of eighty miles. When they were read aloud in the Court Room, we are told, “a thrill of awe ran through those who reverently listened; it seemed as though the finger of God, not man, had written the message.” Ah! it was both fitting and proper that it should be so! The whole procedure; the selection of the inventor; the setting for the reception of the first message; the choice of the words spoken; the reverence of those privileged to be present; and the impression that “the finger of God, not man, had written the message,” convinces one that the Almighty supervised it. Truly, “the fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A celebration was held in honor of Professor Morse, in 1871, in New York, and the original' instrument invented by him was on exhibit, and -. connected by wire with all the ten thousand instruments then in use in the United States. A signal was given, and at that moment, a message from the inventor was flashed like lightning throughout the country, and was read simultaneously in every city and in most of the towns of the nation, all the way from New York to New Orleans and San Francisco. “Thought had conquered space,” as one expressed it; “and it was to make its next conquest in a wholly different direction,” referring to the later utilization of the ether in radio communication. Verily we have entered the Day of His Preparation!</span></p>

The most striking feature of the estimate, however, was the statement that there has been a reduction in the number of hogs by approximately 12,000,-000, in comparison with the same figures Jan. 1,1924. According to the same report, there are 17,589,000 horses, 5,411,000 mules, 25,319,-000 milk cows, 39,134,000 sheep, and 39,609,000 other cattle in the United States. All of these show a decrease of 470,000; 35,000; 35,000; 2,-111,000; and 11,896,000 respectively, excluding the sheep which increased 834,000; or a decrease in value of $56,666,000; $22,341,000; $22,341,-000; and $75,406,000, for the horses, mules, cows and other cattle, respectively; and $71,454,000 increase in value of the sheep; $24,906,000 increase for the swine.</span></p>

From the Canadian side the current is provided by the provincial power plant, and the cost per month is $8. The Canadian plant is owned by the public and is honestly managed in the public interest. Is it a fair practice to charge more than five and one-half times as much for the same service when rendered on this side of the line? What return does the public get for the missing $35?

Los Angeles owns its own water works. It owns its own power plant where most of its electric current is produced. In San Francisco private companies furnish both water and electric current. In San Francisco the rates for both water and electricity are so much higher that if these rates prevailed in Los Angeles it would cost the people of Los Angeles $12,000,000 a year more than at present. But all taxes in Los Angeles do not amount to $12,000,000 a year. In other words the people of Los Angeles save, by reason of municipally-owned power and water systems, enough to pay every cent of taxes collected in the entire city. The citizens of San Francisco are being bled in proportion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“Godfrey Raupert, formerly a member of the British Society for Psychical Research, and for many years prior to his conversion to the Catholic Church an ardent spiritist, takes the attitude that the so-called spiritist phenomena are actually the work of demons. He expresses the conviction that the peculiar antics of the demons which result in what some call spiritist phenomena, are designed to draw the world away from the firm foundations of Christianity. He develops the theory that persons who deyote themselves to Spiritism sink into: a state, of ever-growing passivity with the result ‘that it becomes easier and easier for the evil spiritual being to draw nearer to the inwardness of the spiritist, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">paralyze his will and to break his instinctive resistance, until at last the hour arrives when the invisible foe is in possession of the soul. . . . After having attained their objective the demons frequently sneer at their victims. ... I have become convinced that the material required by the spiritual beings for their successful impersonations of the dead, is taken in the main from the subconsciousness of the living with whom the dead came in contact.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The mooted embargo on Canadian pulpwood going to the United States is arousing considerable interest in the paper industry. It is safe to say that any measure which tends to restrict the outlet for pulpwood results in glutting the home market, which inevitably means that prices will slump to a much lower level than now prevails. Canadian mill owners, and American manufacturers who have large mill interests in Canada, no doubt will support the embargo measure if it will result in a cheaper, less competitive market. American mills which have depended largely on the Canadian raw material supply will temporarily be hurt</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">; but it is</span><span class="font5"> doubtful if they will comply with the alternative which the measure is designed to enforce, that of building more mills in Canada. Rather, with characteristic initiative, they will seek new sources of supply, improve manufacturing methods and utilize materials now greatly neglected. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Monetary Times</span><span class="font5"> presents a well-considered article on the matter, and the question of a fair price to the logger or settler, who produces the bulk of the raw product, is stressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “total embargo” enthusiasts are asked some questions which will be difficult to answer in view of the possibility of the use of substitutes for the spruce wood now largely used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A further commentary on the depression that for three years has characterized Canadian business is found in present stock market conditions. An editorial in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Monetary Times</span><span class="font5"> on “Thei Outlook for Industry” presents a view of matters which must be difficult for the persistent and virulent optimist to harmonize with prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The reduced net surplus of the Canadian Pacific Railway, net earnings of Canada Steamship Lines, little more than sufficient to pay fixed charges, and the British Empire Steel Corporation’s failure to earn, enough to pay its bond interest—these three reports on the affairs of three of our most prominent industrial corporations have dealt a blow to the Canadian stock market which it is scarcely in a position to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“These reports, however, are the result of 1924 operations, and 1924 was a year of considerable difficulty for industry. In his New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font3"> ‘Market Review’, A. D. Noy les says: ‘What the general public is now asking, however, is the significance of this heavy break </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font3"> prices as regards the general business outlook. . . . The answer which people familiar with Wall Street are likely to make is that trade recovery is still distinctly under way, but that the sanguine American temperament has once more shown how easily possible it is to expect too much and too soon.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Whether or not the business recovery has been fully discounted by the stock markets, there has at least been sufficient strength shown to warrant the expectation that our industrial corporations will do better in. 1925 than they did in 1924.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to a survey of the employment field from 1920 to 1925, taking the 1920 employment index as 100, there is shown a general decline to the present level of 86. Immigration follows the general trend of employment and shows its lowest ebb since 1920 at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That immigration presents a far more peculiar problem today than at any time in the history of the past fifty years is brought out in a recent editorial in the Moose Jaw </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">‘■'When David Lloyd George addressed the Winnipeg mass meeting he said that Britain’s problem was not one. of unemployment but of emigration, and he went on to show that before the war millions of British people emigrated to other parts of the world, but that since the war the emigration movement had ceased, while, despite the enormous casualties of the war, population increased. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This statement is recalled by the cable from London today giving particulars of Britain’s contribution to the Anglo-Australian migration agreement, which will be £7,083,000 ($35,400,000 approximately) -in the next ten years, besides the cost of passages, which the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments will share equally between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Thus we have a complete reversal of the migration movement. Whereas formerly newer countries were paying to get immigrants, now Great Britain is willing to spend millions to encourage emigrants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Possibly a good deal of this coolness toward emigration is due to the lamentable failure in the years since the war to make a success 'of “colonizing” the untrained and uncapitalized immigrant. No blazing examples of agricultural success dazzle the eye of the old country artizan or farmer who might thereby be attracted to a prairie farm. Therefore he stays home.</span></p>

A market would have to be found for the gas product and other by-products of coke manufacture, but with only a nominal increase in gas consumption it is calculated that domestic coke would replace at least 50% of the anthracite now used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Considering the difficulties so often experienced, in getting suitable domestic fuel at reasonable rates, an ample supply of cheap coke would go far to solve Canada’s annual fuel problem.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>New Type of Vessel</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">WO vessels of a new type, embodying what is known as the corrugated, or “Monitor”, system of construction, are being built by Messrs. D. &amp;&nbsp;W. Henderson, Partick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The system marks a departure from the tradition that vessels must have a smooth outer surface. Along the sides of the vessels there are two “blisters”, or rounded ridges, extending for about three-quarters of the length, and it is claimed that instead of reducing speed, as might be expected, the bulges make less horsepower necessary for a given speed, apparently because they reduce wave resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the two vessels under construction on the Clyde, each of 9,000 tons dead-weight carrying capacity, two corrugated vessels have recently been launched, and there are building two of 7,500 tons and 6,600 tons respectively on the Tyne, two of 9,000 tons and 10,000 tons respectively on the Wear, and one of 7,500 tons in Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gold and Silver by Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">G</span><span class="font5">OLD and silver totalling £270,000 were recently conveyed from London to Paris on two big air liners. The specie which was packed in a number of iron-bound cases, weighed over two tons, and was consigned to Basle, Switzerland, by a big international bank, which considers that sending money across the channel by air is not only swifter, but is safer than by boat and train, from which it has to be transhipped twice on the journey. In addition to the pilot and the wireless operator, a guard accompanied the specie on the machines.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Queer Cargoes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">LANDSMAN has only a faint idea of the many quaint things carried in the holds of cargo steamers. The other week, for instance, thirteen tons of dried flies formed part of the cargo of the motor liner Bio Panueo, which arrived at Plymouth from Mexico and Cuba. It would be interesting to learn the puipose for which this strange shipment is intended. Personally I do not agree with the joker who said these flies would be a substitute for currants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hens’ eggs, by the million, comprised the cargo of the steamer Melita, which recently left Montreal for Belfast and Glasgow. No single vessel has ever before carried such an extraordinary number of eggs from this port, which can be well understood when the exact figures are stated: 3,132,000 eggs in 8,702 cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year ago the Cunard Liner, Audania, left Southampton for New York with 8,000 canaries and 2,000 cockatoos and African finches. Each bird was housed separately, and the liner’s storerooms were stacked with wicker cages piled high. The unusual surroundings did not affect the birds; they sang lustily. They required 4,000 pounds of seed on the voyage, and claimed the attention of four attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thirteen thousand goldfish was a part cargo consignment on a Japanese liner when it arrived at the London docks a few weeks ago, while on the same day at an adjoining wharf 73 polecats were landed for the zoo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Animal stowaways are frequently among the uninvited guests on cargo steamers. One of the most recent discoveries of this sort was on a tramp steamer that put into Liverpool with a cargo of bananas. Cases of this fruit there certainly were, but the dockers also came across three baby alligators and seven snakes!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A different sort of cargo was on board the German steamship Sophie Marie, arriving from</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Petrograd. This was 700 tons of rags, consisting of cut-up uniforms worn by Russians in the war. The cargo also contained hundreds of tons . of old Russian army shirts and socks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reference to war recalls what was probably one of the oddest cargoes on record, and that was carried some eighteen months ago by a British steamer bound for Morocco. It consisted of 2,000,000 gallons of purified drinking water, for the use of the Spanish troopsffight-ing the rebels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">United Free Stipends</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">HILE wages of all classes of workers are being reduced, and Labor Unions are making desperate efforts to maintain the present standard, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Clergymens’</span><span class="font5"> Union (not “Labor”, for they seldom do any) have succeeded in getting a raise or increase in wages. The following report on the Central Fund for 1924 was submitted at Glasgow Presbytery of the United Free Church of Scotland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In view of the results of the year’s operations the General Assembly’s Committee had unanimously agreed to raise the minimum stipend [a nice clergy-word for salary or wages] from £245 to £282, the highest yet paid in the history of the Fund [or Union], The figures for the Glasgow Presbytery for the year showed contributions amounting to £55,880.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The aim and object of the Central Fund of the above body of clergymen is to get them £300 a year and a free manse. That evidently would be their paradise; but so far they have not attained that.nark; and no doubt, with the nearness of the Lord’s kingdom, they never will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">RITAIN’S historic Waterloo Bridge is at last doomed! The special committee on Thames bridges has presented a definite recommendation that the present bridge be demolished, and a more commodious structure erected in its place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is probable that the new bridge will be much wider, and will consist of only four arches. It will take at least five years to build, during which time the temporary bridge now being constructed will be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The . estimated costs of different proposed structures range from £988,000 to £1, 295,000. Estimates include: (1) The construction of a new bridge, in place of the old, built with not more than five steel arches over the river, and wide enough for six lines of vehicular traffic, including a double line of tramways, if thought desirable. (2) The construction of a vehicle traffic subway under the Strand, from Aldwyck to Wellington Street, to take ninety-five percent of the vehicles using Waterloo Bridge; this subway to be high enough, if possible, to take double-deck tramcars..</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This point may be applied specially to a declaration that Communism, and the methods of the Bolsheviks in Russia, would be impossible in the circumstances existing in Great Britain. By implication, the delegation justified the policy of the British Labor movement in adopting a policy of Constitutional effort, and the attainment of reforms by Parliamentary and orthodox trade union action.</span></p>

A natural enough expectation. Since 1920 trade had been in the doldrums, and the general notion was that it must move out of the dull spell sometime; so why not in the first months of this Spring, now that the political conditions have been stabilized and the nation has a chance to concentrate on the buying and . selling of commodities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But trade has not improved. True, there are faint hints here and there of betterment, but they are so faint that they are hardly worth mentioning. The general situation is about as bad as ever. Indeed the pessimist might very &lt;reasonably argue that it is worse because of the shadow of industrial disputes looming. No one knows if these are to begin; no one knows how they will end; but their mere threat has a disturbing influence and, if the disputes drift into industrial war, they will put off the recovery of British trade to some time in the distant future.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">DAILY rent of £110 ($550) is a staggering figure, but that is the approximate amount that it costs to keep one of the world’s largest liners in dry dock, while she is being overhauled. Twice a year every liner is dry docked for examination, and most of them spend the best part of a week in dock. In addition to the rent, there are other charges, harbor dues, pilotage, hire of cranes, etc., and the cost of drydocking a big liner may be as much as £3,500 before a penny piece has been charged for work done.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>A Green Carnation . </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By John Waite</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">WAS extremely interested to read the fine article “Rose Thoughts” in The Golden Age, and as I am a lover of flowers, I think that the following will be of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Saint Patrick’s Day I was given what to me was a most wonderful flower. It was an exquisite carnation, with a wonderful perfume. On looking at this flower I, at first, thought some one was playing a trick on me, because of the color. The color was a beautiful vivid “Paddy” green and the petals were gradually shaded off to a more brilliant green at the edges. The blossom was of perfect shape and very large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After making inquiries about this wonderful flower I learned that it had actually been grown at one of the experimental hot houses in this district near Calgary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before I left the old country I can remember my father, who was no mean gardener, growing carnations from an almost black to white and yellow, but I never before in all my life had seen a green carnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[We suggest that certain white flowers may be colored with any desired tint by being stood in a vase of suitable dyeing materials as soon as cut, but the various shades of green in the sample petal submitted makes it doubtful if this specimen was tinted.

<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The South African Native at Home</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE some clippings from Durban, showing how the South African native is treated in his own home by the whites; and it is not a happy picture. In some respects it is worse than the situation in Chicago. In Stand-erton, South Africa, last Fall, Mr. Leonardus Johannes Labuschagne tied a native black girl to a cart; and flogged her to death. For doing this he was sentenced to the whole of six weeks at hard labor. .....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If this man had done this in Texas, he might have escaped unpunished, if he had had sufficient influence to silence the mouths of witnesses of his crime. But in Chicago there is one chance in 365 that he might have been electrocuted. They are great lovers of justice in Chicago. For every 365 murders that they have in Chicago, one man pays the death penalty. The majesty of the law must be upheld, in Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have before us the bylaws of Durban. The city stands where once there was a village wholly occupied by blacks, whose ancestors had</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>JTOE17</sup>’<sup>19S5</sup>’<sup>:;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. qoiDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lived ther'e from time immemorial. Today no.-native may legally live within three, miles of the, outskirts of the municipality, except landowners, students, police or other officials, the aged, the sick or duly registered servants of the 'whites. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Durban has been recently enforcing the provisions of the act which requires natives to live.,-, beyond the three-mile limit. The Natal J.J-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">.viser</span><span class="font5"> contains a letter from one of the natives affected, Nivard Mdhtetche, which will appeal to anybody who has a spark of justice dr manhood in his makeup: <sup>;</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I beg to protest against the proposed removal of natives from the suburbs of Durban. I am a native. I do not own ground,'but T do lease a small plot. I- have at great sacrifice, built a housewhich cost me over £140. This money has been saved from wages earned during many years. I have resided in the vicinity for the last twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I think there will be a great deal of trouble before this matter is settled. Supposing I do remove outside the three-mile limit. At present I walk five miles to work and five miles back. Can I walk eight miles each way and do a day’s work in between? No ! Can I afford to pay for a ride each way ? No! What shall I do? I have'a'wife and two youngsters. I will have to get a hovel of some sort, and crowd my family into it-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“'Thore are quite a-lot of decently behaved natives; and I think the proposed'enforcing of the law will be heart-breaking. IVe have- never hankered after- political power, but things like this must force us to act unitedly. Oh, that I had been an Indian, a Chinaman, Russian Jew, or anything.but a native of South. Africa in Africa1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every black who comes into Durban must register with the . police within twenty-four hours and explain the object of his visit, which is limited to five days. If he secures employment, his employer must get him an identification card, and must pay twenty-five cents the first month and twelve and one-half cents each additional month he remains in his employ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In lieu of one employer the native may, at his option, become a Togt man, subject to employment by anybody who demands his services, at the rate of fifty cents per day. If engaged in washing,' or in stevedore work inside the bay, he is allowed seventy-five cents; in stevedore work outside the bay, $1 per day. Unless engaged in pulling tfie whites around in rickshas’ it is .illegal for-him to be on-the streets between the. hours of 9 p. m. and 5 a. m.; but “a.ricksha</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">puller may ply for hire with his ricksha until' the hour of midnight”. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a native’s employer,...fails to provide him with a card, the employer, must pay $10 or be imprisoned seven days; if the native fails to see to it that he gets a card he must pay a $10 fine or be imprisoned, perhaps with hard labor, for a period of two months. A Togt man must live in the compound provided by the Town Council, paying $1.25 per month for the shelter, water, lighting and sanitary conveniences which it affords him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The laws of Durban prohibit anybody from leasing land to natives, except in certain areas set aside for that purpose. The spaces allotted are so cramped that a writer in the Natal </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span><span class="font5"> declares that “when the Public Health Committee went on a tour , of inspection three, months ago, in one quarter, adjacent to the main road, they found over 300 people living on a space of ground not much larger than would be allotted for the requirements of the ordinary household grounds and garden elsewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Can anyone suppose that the natives enjoy being herded together in such miserable fashion, after having been once allowed the unrestricted use of all that great country ? But what can they do? When, not long ago, 150 of them purchased a single farm at Rustenburg, South Africa, the white farmers immediately took legal action to get rid of them. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Mr. Leonardos Johannes Labuschagne got his six weeks’ sentence for murdering the native girl, there was a considerable commotion among some of the humane people of South Africa who are not just positive that the blacks in their midst are being treated in a perfectly Christlike manner. Ten of these, all clergymen, joined in certain resolutions, which are so tame that we present them as a curiosity:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(1) That whereas it appears that juries are too prone to treat offences committed by Europeans against natives too leniently, the question is recommended to the Government for consideration whether the jury system ought not to be reconsidered in its application to such cases; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) That it is also earnestly recommended to the Government that legislation should be introduced prohibiting the illicit intercourse of white men and black women, and treat such as a serious offence in view of the increasing number of white settlers and others who have been guilty of this practise. . .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The papers that bear these items to us also narrate that “native affairs in the main are coming so rapidly to a head that it requires a minister’s whole time to cope with them”. We should imagine that it would be difficult for the missionaries to convey a very good idea to the natives of just what the Christian religion really is and what it stands for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is reported that the native women of Bloemfontein do not take kindly to the proposed compulsory medical examination of their sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">General Smuts, one time Premier of South Africa, once said that the acid test of the European is their treatment of the colored people. If that is the case then it looks as if they had met their test about as Mr. Wilson met his, when he said that the way the American Government would treat the Russian Government would be the acid test of the friendship of the American people for the Russian people.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The John Brown Rebellion </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. c. L. c.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> HAVE been a reader of your magazine since it was first published, and have found it very instructive and helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Often I have noticed corrections made to certain articles, and feel it right to call attention to some misstatements made in the article “The Switzerland of America,” by J. L. Bolling, published in Golden Age No. 141, especially that part relating to the “John Brown Rebellion”. Mr. Brown, the writer says, was a Kansan, “and lived in the immediate vicinity”, also that he was a school teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The John Brown farm and the home where he lived, and to which his body was brought and buried in the family cemetery, is the farm which has been taken over by some patriotic society since I visited the spot. It is now a noted place for tourists, who visit it by the thousands every year, and is located at North Elba, Essex Co., N. Y., just outside that beautiful summer resort, Lake Placid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was born and grew up in the adjoining county of Clinton, New York, and from my earliest youth I have been familiar with the story. Mr. Bolling says that John Brown got his “inspiration for his act from the book entitled ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ ”. John Brown may have read that book (every one was reading it at that time), and it may have hastened his act. But he knew more about the slave trouble than Harriet Beecher Stowe ever did, as he was one of the leaders of the then famous “Underground Railway”, which extended from the South to the Canadian boundary, and over which the poor slaves were helped by the sympathetic people of the North.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In each town where the slaves were taken in there was a station, and there they were given food and allowed to rest, or were kept hidden, if the officers from the South were chasing them. They were helped all along the way until they reached Canada and freedom. It was from these poor bruised, often crippled human beings, that John Brown received his inspiration; and his great sympathetic heart went out to € them, after he had seen with his own eyes, and had heard with his own ears the heart-rending stories they had to tell, and had washed the poor bleeding backs which had felt the cruel lash of the slave driver’s whip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that John Brown did wrong; but who can say that he was not an instrument in the Lord’s hand to call attention to conditions then prevailing in the South?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John Brown was a man who was well liked in the community in which he lived. He may have “taught school”, but this is the first time I ever heard of it. My parents and my grandfather have told me all I know about the home life of the Brown family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Soon after his death, the letters John Brown wrote to his wife when he was in prison were published in book form; and I remember reading them when only a little child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was born during the war between the North and South, and heard nothing but the abolition side of the question; and my sympathy was all with the North. About twenty years ago I came into the South to live, and here I have met many of the people who were slave owners, and I have heard their side of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Truly there are two sides to every story; and since I know the other side, my sympathies are divided. I find some who are still very bitter toward the North; others are willing to admit that they should have accepted President Lincoln’s offer and sold their slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now just a word about that “New England school teacher” who wrote “a famous book entitled ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’.” At the time Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote this story, she was the mother of a family; and in a biography of her life I remember reading how difficult it was for her to even find time to write the story, as her hands were burdened with the care of her children and with looking after the many household duties that fall to the lot of any good mother. We wonder whether a busy mother had the time to read “exaggerated newspaper stories” and then “fill in the gaps with gross misrepresentations drawn wholly from a vivid imagination”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us think kindly of all. We were in the time of the end; knowledge was to increase; and it seems to me these two persons were instruments in the Lord’s hand to call attention to the darkest blot ever placed upon our homeland, the United States of America, “the land overshadowed with wings.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Illinois Tornado</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> GIVE you a brief description of some items connected with the great tornado which recently passed through southern Illinois. So far as known this storm was the most destructive of life and property of any tornado that ever visited the American continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">: The path of the storm was about three-quarters of a mile wide. Many have taken notice of the fact that every church in its path was completely destroyed, while many other buildings of equal height were spared. The banks in Murphysboro have closed their doors, the Building and Loan associations have dissolved, and the common talk is that Murphysboro and De Soto will never be rebuilt. However, we believe that they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this district the homes of seven families of Bible Students were in the path of the storm, and I think it would be of interest to your readers to know something of the experiences of these families. We will take their homes in the order in which the storm visited them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first house struck was that of Mr. George Beasley. $100 will pay the damage here, and no cue was hurt. The next home was that of Mr. Charles Piper. There was very little damage done to his house, but about $300 to his barn and other buildings; he himself received only a scratch on the nose. The next home was that of Mr. Will Piper. This man, his wife, daughter and two sons were all left standing on the floor, but no one can tell where the house went. There is no sign that there ever was a house there, except the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next home was that of Mrs. Electra</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By 8. 8. Goodin</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beasley, but at this time there is not a sign of the home that once stood there. The family was carried about one-quarter of a mile. Airs. Beasley and her son Bichard were killed; two daughters were not hurt. The husband and other sons were not at home. The husband would not let his wife attend Bible Students’ meetings. He is now in the Carbondale hospital, not expected to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next home was that of Air. Braden, and it is so completely gone you could not tell there was ever a house there. Mr. Braden heard the storm and stepped outside to see what was the matter. As he turned the corner to look, the house left for parts unknown. He received a few scratches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next home, Air. Kilmer’s, looks as if some one with a cannon had been practising on it. There is a hole in it every five or six feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The last home was that of Air. Ed Beasley, where the meetings were held. The husband locked the back door and the wife the front door: both then went into the living room and Air. Beasley said to his wife, “Alother, I guess we are gone.” Just then the storm hit the house. The wife fell to the floor: the bookcase fell on her- leg and the table over her. A cupboard fell on the piano, with Air. Beasley under the cupboard and next to the piano, with nothing holding him. The storm hardly lasted two minutes. AVhen it had passed Mr. Beasley crawled out, lifted the bookcase from off his wife, and they both went to help others. There was nothing left of their home except the furniture that had fallen on them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">I have seen these animals on different occasions stalking, about, in the .woods at almost every hour of the day.. Some of the largest and best specimens of this animal I have seen were feeding in the woods between 9 and 11 o’clock in the daytime. However I have seen more of them in the late afternoon, and especially along</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">about dusk. It is true that they venture forth more frequently after sundown. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two years ago I saw an armadillo which was feeding near a road. It was shortly after 4 o’clock in the afternoon and some schoolboys, who also saw it gave chase and-soon caught it. On several other occasions I have seen them caught during the daytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The o’possum and skunk are two other ani-<sub>: </sub>mals which, like the armadillo, do lots of their prowling at night; but I and most everyopp who has lived in parts of the country where these animals are to be found have noted that they frequently venture forth in daytime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">IT EREIN I ani presenting the picture of what</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">-i ’seems, to be a new species of serpent which, was recently discovered in the Highland Peach Orchard region, seven miles north of Nashville, Arkansas, and..which is now on. exhibition at / Nashville.. and . attracting nl u c h attention throughout that section. Since the discovery of this first one, five or six more have been captured, and are now on exhibition, also. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p><img src="g_E_19250617_files/g_E_19250617-5.png" alt="" style="width:241pt;height:168pt;">
<p><span class="font5">All these specimens I have carefully examined and find them all just alike, but different from any other species ever before seen in this part of the world or elsewhere, as far as I am able to ascertain. My attention was first called to this little serpent by a crowd all intent upon seeing it through a show-window at a garage; and I walked up to see what was causing the attraction. But when I saw nothing more than a little snake in a pint flask, I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">turned away and thought no more about if . until the next day, when some- one asked me if, I had seen the “picture snake”. It w<sup>T</sup>as then I learned for the first time what the real point of attraction . was, and returned to make a further examination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To my great surprise I found that the little creature had the picture of a beautiful woman on the top of its head. . This is not so clearly discernible in the accompanying cut as on-the snake itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wonderful, isn’t it, that this same vise, and subtile creature, which was used by Satan to deceive, should now appear in “animated mov-. ing pictures” to call attention to the Bible story of the fall of man, and thus be used to glorify the woman's seed (Christ), to show forth the triumph of. the woman over her deceiver (Satan), by her insignia appearing on the serpent’s head which is to be bruised! Thus is aptly symbolized the deliverance of all the. children of men in the Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A further interesting, if not significant, point in connection with this matter is that it vms a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font5"> who captured this picture-serpent, and who discovered the feminine features on the top of its head. She did not capture this snake, in the original Garden of Eden, it is true. But Highland Orchard, where it was discovered-, is regarded by many an Arkansas traveler as the; nearest approach to Eden of any place on earth.-It has plenty of unforbidden fruits which may be partaken of freely without fear of untoward . results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’•</span></p>

Elihu Boot is hostile to socialism, and that his selection to represent America in a socialistic republic was ill-advised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It is the constitutional right of every citizen to express his opinion about the war or the participation of the United States in it; about the desirability of-peace; about the merits or demerits of the system of conscription, and about the moral rights or claims of conscientious objectors to be exempt from </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">conscription.

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> THINK the invention of Mr. Bennett of Wilkinsburg, Pa., described in Goldex Age No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">139, will be worthless, unless its ginning parts are entirely different from those of the gins now in use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of short-lint cotton, from the same variety of seed, the best lint is obtained only after ^he picked cotton has lain in a dry and well-sheltered and ventilated place for three weeks or more. If ginned sooner, the lint fibers are torn, more or less, on even the best of gins; and when the farmer sells, he is docked from $3 to $5 a bale on each 500-lb. bale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long-lint cotton requires a different gin; and therefore, although long-lint cotton is the better, it cannot be raised in the same ginning district as the short lint. Short-lint cotton requires saw gins; long-lint cotton roller gins, with pins or pegs. A roller gin will get the most cotton off from short-lint seed, but revolves too slowly; while a short-lint gin will destroy the fiber of long-lint cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Handling cotton is a ticklish business. Loose cotton cannot be shipped to a gin; for it takes too much room, and the costs would be prohibitive. In its compressed form, it is dangerous to ship, as rubbing may ignite it; and though you sink it in a lake or river, it will burn up iif fire once gets a good start inside the bale.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE been asked to give a recipe for making -whole-wheat bread, and we are glad to do so. It is the recipe for getting well and keeping well. Whole-wheat bread has in it all the elements of life. It looks good, it tastes good, and it is good. If you are in a hurry to take a one-way trip to the cemetery, eat plenty of white bread. The whiter the bread, the sooner you get your ride. But it is a disgrace to take the trip merely because you have not had any better way of killing yourself than packing yourself with plaster of paris. Cheer up! While you are here you might as well be healthy as sick. It would be much more fun for yourself and for those about you. Why be a whining invalid when you can spread sunshine all around by eating whole-wheat bread instead of white bread? And it is cheaper, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you use brown soft sugar instead of white granulated sugar, and if you use bran fresh from the mill instead of the cooked and prepared brans which are on the market, the bread will be improved in wholesomeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Get a mill and grind your own wheat. Choice wheat can be obtained from farmers and seed dealers. Mills for grinding the wheat may be obtained from the mail order houses. Wheat is hard to grind, so it is better to get a mill which has at least a 24-inch wheel, obtaining thereby greater power. The Fulton mill is good.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We are especially interested in the programs being broadcast from stations WBBR, Staten Island, N.

<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font5">E HAVE m hand at the moment a couple of offers of masses from the Roman Catholic Sulpician Seminary, Brookland Post Office, .Washington, D. C., that might interest some of our readers. There is a time limit on one of these deals. The masses were to be said on April 3rd and on Easter, and as those dates are past, probably nobody would be greatly excited over the announcements. But the following seems to be good at any time that you have anything from $10 up that neither you nor your family can use for any legitimate purposes in life. We do not know anything about these Sulpicians except that they say they are willing to take the money, and that the words Sulpician and Suspicion look much alike. Here you are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TEN DOLLARS will procure for a DEPARTED SOUL A MEMBERSHIP in our PURGATORIAL SOCIETY. This will entitle the soul enrolled as a MEMBER to share in many special Masses each year, in the merits of the great good work of training young men for the Priesthood, and in the daily prayers and Masses of the Seminary. Secure memberships for your deceased relatives and friends. By so doing you will render a great service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TWENTY DOLLARS will make YOU A PERPETUAL ASSOCIATE MEMBER and entitle you to share in many Masses and other spiritual benefits not only after your death but also during the present life. Secure memberships for yourself and your relatives and friends yet living. You and they will be greatly blessed and the cause of training Priests greatly helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FIFTY DOLLARS will secure the same benefits for an entire family or special group or organization. This is known as A FAMILY, OR GROUP, OR ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP. Secure such a membership for your family or for the Society to which you belong.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS will make you not only a BENEFACTOR but a FOUNDER. Such an amount would provide a PERPETUAL SCHOLARSHIP bearing YOUR NAME. It would yield in interest each year sufficient to maintain continuously </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">student for the Priesthood. The line of young men whom you would thus help to be ordained would be in a very real sense YOUR priests. Each of them would offer for you and yours twelve Masses a year, for each year they were supported by the income from your Scholarship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE FULL AMOUNT to make one a MEMBER, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">BENEFACTOR, OR A FOUNDER may be paid in installments, if so desired.</span></p>

Your money so invested would be protected by the integrity of our Institution and also by the laws of the State of Maryland under which we are incorporated.

The bishop issued a proclamation in which he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I now formally forbid every Catholic in these dioceses to organize or take part in these Saturday night dances. Should this formal prohibition be ignored I shall make the offence referred to a reserved sin, in the first place,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is a new one, first that any bishop could manufacture sins, second that he could classify them, making one kind of sins reserved and the other what might be called the bleacher type, and third that this does not exhaust his powers in this direction.

<p><span class="font5">LORY,■ to God in the- highest, and on A-T earth peace, good, .will toward men.”— Luke 2:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one is glad to hear good news. <sub>:</sub> It was. indeed good news which the humble, shepherds on the hillsides of Palestine heard when an angel with a- multitude of the; heavenly, host sang the glad tidings that in the City of David was born a “Savior, which is Christ: the Lord”. ■ These glad tidings of great joy were not only for the shepherds or for a few selected persons, but for all people. The whole .world: wasrto share in the good news. . Good news often: pertains to only a few, or even to a Single person. But here is-news which is of universal significance and application, in which the whole . world is to rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a child is born into this world, the event is generally considered as good news and the day is one for rejoicing. It is doubly so when at the anxious solicitation of kind friends and neighbors, the fact is learned that the mother and child are doing well. Ibis a day for felicitations .and congratulations • and one’s. birthday is always to be remembered with gifts and rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">'■But here, this day, -in. the town of Bethlehem was born a child over, whom the angels rejoiced; and the heavens resounded with the glad tidings. This child was to make the whole earth rejoice and be glad; for a Savior, Christ the Lord, was hornthis day. This child was-. to fulfil the hopes of all past generations since the world began, and was to shape the destiny of the then J ewish world, God’s 'chosen people,' mid the destiny of all generations yet to<sup>:</sup> be born. This child did exactly what the angels said it would do. It fulfilled all the prophecies of the past concerning the Messiah, the Christ; and it has brought more joy and peace into the world than all the other children that were ever born into this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was the message that the angels sang: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” This message shows that the- angels rejoiced not only over the new-born babe at its birth, but over what this child -was destined to accomplish in the ■world. Not only should we be glad’ when a child is born, but we should look forward to and be grateful for its possibilities and develop-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">ment, and what it may he able to do in the world..</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a wonderful possibility and destiny-in .every child that is born. Wrapped up- in each tiny babe may be a hero, a philanthropist,, a great discoverer.or an inventor, a great scientist, a statesman, a. philosopher,, a preacher or a teacher that shall startle the whole world. No one can tell what mysteries, what powers, what destinies lie hidden in a new-born child. But here, in the City of David, a child was born--this day whose power and destiny the angels&quot;’ revealed in joyful, happy acclaim, because He was to bring peace on earth and good will among men and to make the whole earth rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here we may candidly ask the question: Did the angels make any mistake when they thus' proclaimed the birth of this child? Has this child fulfilled the destiny that the angels said He would? Has the world good reason to .rejoice over the Savior that was born this day? Christ’s life, work and teaching, as recorded ■ in the four Gospels, and referred, to in the Acts •• and in the Epistles of the New Testament, are a sufficient answer to these questions.. We need'' not ask the question whether these writings, are : . authentic or not. Nor need we ask whether what was written is the truth, nor whether the. ■writers were competent to write, the facts as. they knew them. All these questions are fully answered in the affirmative by the internal, evidence concerning the individual writers, and by what they have written. Besides, all the external evidence that we have goes to prove both that these writers were competent to write, and that what they have written is the truth and perfectly trustworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We might begin to enumerate all the facts . and truths in the New Testament concerning the birth and life of Christ, as also in fact all the sayings of the Old Testament that have reference to the work and life' of Christ. But this would make this manuscript too large. I content myself by referring to only two principles that Christ embodied in His own life and taught by precept and example, to show that the angels were not mistaken in their joyful, announcement of what this new-born child was &quot;&nbsp;to be and do to bring peace, joy and good-will , among men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first principle is the truth contained in . ■ the Golden Rule, and the second is also-implied''--</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">in the Golden Rule. But to make it more definite and emphatic, we shall assume it as a second principle and call it the Law of Service, as it was exemplified and taught by Christ. We might add a third principle or truth, which is love—love to God and love to our fellow men. This is indeed the fundamental law of God, and includes both the principle of the Golden Rule and the law of service, since neither can be fully carried out without love as a ruling and guiding motive in the hearts and lives of men. Love is the greatest power in the world; and Where love reigns supreme, sin cannot exist, nor fear of any kind, for “perfect love casteth out fear”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But in this present article on Peace and Good Will, I shall simply refer to the truth as Christ taught, ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,’ and to the law of service, which later Christ so vividly illustrated when He, their Lord and Master, girded himself with a towel and washed the disciples’ feet, thus performing the most humble and menial service. Then He hade his disciples go and do similar service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the Golden Rule were universally observed for a month, a week, a day, it would speedily bring peace on earth and good will among men. The good tidings of great joy that the angels brought to the shepherds when Christ was born would then be fulfilled; and again we might hear the heavenly host rejoicing and singing the glad refrain, “Glory to God in the highest”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The angels indeed are singing, and their voices have not been silenced since the shepherds first heard them on the hills not far from Bethlehem. But the world has a deaf ear, and is out of tune with the song of the angels. The finest instruments that man has thus far invented are not delicate enough to catch the voices of the angels. And no instrument will ever do this. In fact no instrument is necessary to get in tune with the angelic host. All that is necessary is to get our spirit attuned to the spirit of God; and we shall hear the voice of the angel as the shepherds heard, and when he bade them: “Fear not; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why does the world not hear and rejoice at this good news?. The answer is, Because the world has not yet learned to know and to obey the Golden Rule. What principally ails the world is greed and selfishness. These are contrary to the Golden Rule. Greed and selfishness? Yes, indeed; you see them everywhere. To prosecute a few war profiteers would not do much good. It might teach a lesson to a few, if our attorney general would institute suit against half a dozen such profiteers; but this would not reach the mighty guilty host of profiteers all over these United States. Perhaps this is the reason why the attorney general has so far refrained from prosecutions. It might seem like persecution rather than prosecution of war profiteers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Greed and selfishness cannot be outlawed, or prosecuted out of existence. To get rid of greed and selfishness necessitates learning, teaching, and training to obey the Golden Rule. And this is the only cure for selfishness and all the other ills from which the world suffers. The fact that Christ taught this oiie truth in the Golden Rule justifies the angels’ song of “peace on earth, good will to men”. If Christ had not taught another truth, there would be abundant reason for rejoicing at the Savior’s birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some parts we find prejudice against the Golden Rule. Some years ago a prominent senator of the United States said that the Golden Rule had no place in politics. If this is true, the fault lies not in the. Golden Rule but in politics. It is safe to say that no matter what a person’s standing may be in society or how prominent a place he may occupy in the political world, when he publicly declares that the Golden Rule has no place in politics that person has no business to be in politics. Politics would get along better without him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same thing holds good in business of any kind. Any industry that cannot be conducted on the principle of the Golden Rule has no business to exist; for the world would be better off without it. This is equally true of the person or persons themselves who conduct the business. It is no profit to the man himself who profiteers. In the long run he will not be a success; for he is out of harmony with the law of God. The saying, “The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine,”: is applicable in his case. Numerous examples might be cited of persons who conduct, their affairs on the Golden Rule principle, who have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">large success where others have failed, and who have found that it pays in dollars and cents to follow the principle of the Golden Rule. It needs no argument that most of the world’s ills are caused by greed and selfishness, and that the Golden Rule is the proper panacea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no doubt that the World War was caused by greed and selfishness, and more than one nation was guilty. Nobody now wants to admit this; but it is true, nevertheless. We may freely admit that self-interest is legitimate. Self interest seeks its own, and has a right to do so. But self-interest can never disregard other interests without a transgression of the Golden Rule. For any nation, or several nations, to go on a rampage, bound on destroying their neighbor in a barbarous fashion, is not legitimate self-interest. It is not necessary, nor is it right, nor does it pay, for one nation to seek to destroy another nation in order that the one nation may be able to exist, going on the principle that might makes right. This it never does. Nor has any nation a right to destroy another nation or deprive her of her liberties, in order to make more room for herself, any more than I have a right to destroy, or kill, or injure my neighbor in order to make more room for me to exist. The principle of the Golden Rule applies between nations as well as individuals, and if this rule is obeyed, w-ar and greed and selfishness will disappear from the face of the earth, and peace and good-will will take the place of envy, hate and selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World War itself, with all its destructiveness of life and property, the interruption of the World’s normal economic life, the enormous financial burdens that the war entailed, and the disruption of international traffic and intercourse, not to mention the untold and indescribable suffering caused by the war, should be lesson enough that greed and selfishness do not pay; and that the principle of the Golden Rule should be speedily substituted for hate and strife and war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can see why nothing of any practical value was accomplished at the Genoa Conference. Political rivalry and selfishness predominated there, and the principle of the Golden Rule was either not considered or was left in the background. At least it was not operative in the discussions and deliberations, as far as reports showed. The principal blame for this,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">no doubt history will place upon Russia and Germany. There is still too much political rivalry or, we might call it in plain terms, selfishness, among the European nations; and the result is war, rumors of war, envy, hatred, and unrest, and all the suffering and burdens that such a state of things entails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know the “sick man of Europe” and his murderous hatred of innocent and defenseless humanity—the darkest blot on the world’s civilization today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And what about Russia? Where does this nation stand in the light of the Golden Rule? From all authentic accounts, Russia is about the most misgoverned nation on the globe. Whatever her theories of government may be, it is a nation ruled by force; and no nation so ruled can be governed by the principle of the Golden Rule. As long as this law of God is violated, any authority or ruling power is bound to be a failure. All the results under the Soviet rule justify these statements. Only the rights of the rulers and the army are respected and guaranteed. The rights of the individuals are not, and every individual has rights, given and endowed by the Creator himself. Any man, or set of men, or any system of government that forfeits these inalienable rights of men—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness—transgress the law of God and can never be a success while this law is violated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of the best people of Russia have been murdered ruthlessly and shockingly, or else have been driven out of the country altogether, by a theory or system of government that has no ground for its existence either in moral?, religion, or in common sense and decency for humanity. Its motive is selfishness, as ir lias ; been conducted so far, and cannot be sanctioned by the law’ of God and the principle of the Golden Rule. How could the people rejoice, and peace and goodwvill prevail, under this system of government!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Selfishness did not pay Germany with all their boastfulness during the war. It will not pay Russia, nor any other nation or individual on earth. No nation nor individual unless they come under the dominion of the Golden Rule, will ever hear the angel’s voice of glad tidings: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will tow<sup>r</sup>ard men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The absence of the Golden Rule principle in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">government and the numerous relations between individuals causes trouble all around. This is the cause of the trouble between labor and capital. Peace ought to prevail between individuals and groups of individuals. What is the cause of strikes, boycotts, and lockouts ? This industrial warfare between employer and employee? This is as unnecessary and uncalled for as any other kind of warfare, and under the principle of the Golden Rule need not exist aJB. could not exist if the rulers obeyed. Selfirnness is evident here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The laborer is worthy of his hire, and is entitled to fair wages and proper working conditions. The laborer should not be treated as a tool or a machine to be exploited by the employer to accumulate wealth that he may use for his own benefit. The laborer is entitled to such a share of the wealth he creates or produces that he and his family may subsist in co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mf</span><span class="font5">ort. There are industries increasing in number where such conditions obtain; and you never hear of any trouble. Both employer and employee are satisfied when the Golden Rule is adhered to by both capital and labor. To disregard and go contrary to the law of God is the cause of all past, present and future strikes and industrial unrest. It' is also exceedingly costly from a financial standpoint. It does not pay. The loss in wages, the bad feeling engendered by strikes and lockouts, such brutality as occurred at Herrin, Ill., could be avoided by fair dealing. And would not the angels sing for joy, if the Christ idea could be born again in the hearts of men, and the Golden Rule become the guiding principle in the affairs of mankind !</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next to the Golden Rule or else implied in it is service. Not the service of a slave, but the service of “good will”, is what the world stands in need of, a fair day’s labor for a fair day’s wage. Not to give as little as you can for a day’s pay, but to work with a will and a heart, must be the attitude of the laborer under the Golden Rule. This does not exhaust a person nearly as much as it will if he watches the clock and tries to do as little as he can. The law of service forbids any loafing on the job or shirking of one’s duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This law of service is most generally applied to works of charity and altruism. It applies here, of course; but it also applies in every relation of human life. We have a saying, “Service counts.” It has a value that cannot be overestimated. It is what service we can render to mankind that means success in life and that makes life worth living. It is the busy bee that gathers honey and fills the hives; and if we could know them, they are by far the happier in the lot. Without them the rest of the hive would perish. So it is the workers that count; and they also get their reward, not only in dollars and cents, but in the satisfaction of work “Well done”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are the God-given laws of our being— the Golden Rule and Service. We can no more change or disregard these laws than we can change or ignore the law of gravitation without penalty. If the law of gravitation were suspended for a minute, the world would go to smash. We cannot go contrary to this law without, paying the penalty. The law of gravitation is what makes the earth revolve around the sun, the moon around the earth, and holds the planets in their orbits. Only the Creator of all things could make this universe work so harmoniously and so accurately that an eclipse of the sun or the moon can be computed accurately to the minute in any part of the world. The same Creator, the Great I AM, has also made man and the moral laws to govern him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principle of the Golden Rule and the law of service are divine laws, which mankind must obey, or else civilization will be sick and diseased and must finally die. Knowing that these statements are true because God said so and Christ said so, and because we ourselves know that they are true and easily observable by all men, I do not hesitate to state that Christ and His teachings are the only truths and forces that can save the world from sin and selfishness by obedience to these laws of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The angel of God made no mistake when he appeared to the shepherds and proclaimed tidings of great joy when Christ was born at. Bethlehem. This sad, sin-stricken -world will make no mistake when they listen to the voige of the angel, and take heed to the teaching of Christ, the Lord and Savior of the world. Only-then will the world be made to rejoice and the anthem of the angelic host be fulfilled, “Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will toward men.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>In the Resurrection Where Will You Be?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Radioeast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.0 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HE term resurrection means “standing up again to life”. The very definition suggests that those to be resurrected are without life. Examination of the Scriptures relating to the dead proves that the dead are unconscious. They are as though they had not been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To have faith that the dead now in the tomb will again stand upon the earth brings hope to the sorrowing hearts of those who have lost loved ones. But there can be no faith without knowledge, and that knowledge must be based upon trustworthy evidence. The Bible is the only true source of knowledge concerning man, his death and his resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without hope of successful contradiction 1 emphatically assert that the dead are in their graves; that God has made provision for their redemption and deliverance; and that in His due time He will awaken them out of death and will give each one an opportunity for everlasting life. .This proof I will present from the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lassume in the outset that the Bible is true. I believe that it is God's Word of Truth. My purpose is to help the people understand the Scriptures, and that without a money consideration. My argument will appeal to those who are reasonable, and who believe the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “sleep” is sometimes employed to denote death, because it is God's purpose to awaken the dead. A writer of the Holy Scriptures, addressing himself to those who trust in the Word of God, says in 1 Thessalonians 4: 13,14: “But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who believe this scripture have hope for their beloved dead that they will see them again. If children have lost their parents, if parents have been robbed of their children by death, or others who loved each other have been separated by this great enemy, the surviving ones who believe the Bible have hope that their loved ones w ill come again, and this hope brings peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My desire is to comfort those who have been sad because of death amongst their beloved, and to do so by helping them to understand the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be conceded that the love of a good mother for her child is the nearest approach to divine love. The child is bone of her bone, and flesh of her flesh. When the cruel enemy death tears the child from the mother’s arms and its little body lies silent and lifeless in the grave, her grief knows no bounds. The Lord has graciously arranged that those who will hear His Word shall in such a sad hour receive comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through His prophet Jeremiah (31:16,17) God says: “Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shall come again to their own border.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no babes in heaven. No human being could go to heaven until first he makes an intelligent consecration to do the will of God and thereafter faithfully obeys the Lord even unto death. One who dies as an infant could not do this. All the babes that have died are in their graves waiting for the resurrection. The people are going to see a great multitude of dear babes on the earth before many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The text just quoted says that they are now in the land of the enemy, which is death; and that they shall come again to their own border. What was their own border? The earth, of course. They lived nowhere else. This then is proof that they are coming back to live on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It must seem apparent to all reasonable minds that if babes, who have really done no harm, are in heaven, the place of eternal bliss, then there would be no reason to bring them back to earth. Furthermore, if they were alive they could not be resurrected, for the reason a live creature cannot be resurrected. The same rule applies to all who have died. If the wicked man is in conscious torment, he could not be resurrected, because already alive; and if he is there eternally, that is of itself proof conclusive that he could not be brought out. Thus we see that the doctrines of “inherent immortality” and “eternal torture” are diametrically opposed to the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Resurrection the Basis of Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">B</span><span class="font5">UT it may be suggested by some that there</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. is a doubt about the resurrection. Let us examine the Scriptures. All who believe the Bible believe that Jesus Christ arose from the dead. Upon this certainty St. Paul bases his. argument .concerning, the resurrection of the dead, in 1 ’ Corinthians 15:12-23, 25, 26. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now. if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say. some among you that there is?-fto resurrection of the dead? But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. . And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching .vain, and your faith is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.. For.if. the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye.are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen .asleep, in Christ are. perished. If in this life only we have .hope in Christ, we are.of all.men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstf ruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For. as.in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all .be- made .alive. But every man in his own order; Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's, at his coming. ... For lie must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” f</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why should the..dead.be. resurrected? I answer, Because it is G od’s plan for the blessing of mankind. He created the first man perfect, who sinned, was sentenced to death; and all the human'family inherited death. God promised in Hosea 13: 14 to redeem man from death: “I will, ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; 0 grave, I will be thy destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the terms of God’s law the only method of redemption was by the willing death of another perfect creature. Jesus was made flesh, a man, that He might taste death for every man. (Hebrews 2: 9) When on earth He said that He. came for the very purpose of giving Himself a ransom for. mankind and. thus of fulfilling God’s promise. Matthew 20: 28: “Even as the Son of man came, not to be ministered unto, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” ■ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ' ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ i - ■ f</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus came, died and arose from the dead, that the people might have life and have it more abundantly. At the time of His death and resurrection, men had been dying and going into the grave for a, period of 4,000 years. None of them had gone to heaven. But 'the' time must come in which all the dead shall be resurrected, both the good and the bad; and in proof of this I read Acts 24:15 and John 5: 28, 29 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.:</span><span class="font5"> “And have hope townrd God’ which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurreeti on of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.” “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life: and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Does “Church” Mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HUS you observe that there are two classes to be awakened out of death; those who have done good, and those who have done evil. All were born evil; and none are good except those who have fully consecrated themselves<sup>: </sup>to the Lord, received the imputation of Christ’s merit, and have continued in this attitude until death. This class in the Bible is called the Church. “Church” does not’mean some organization presided over by a man who takes up a collection and pretends to preach. The scripture says that the Church is the Body of Christ. Colossians 1:18: “And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Church” means a called-out class. This is the class referred to by the Lord when He said in Revelation 20: 6 : “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection; on such the second death hath no power, but they shall-fie priests of God and of Christ, and shall reigni with him a thousand years.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the overcoming class, to whom 'Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I wall give thee a crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10) And again in Revelation 3:21: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my. throne, even as I also overcame, and am set 'down with my Father in his throne.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' This is the class mentioned by the apostle Paul, when he said, in 1 Corinthians 15:41- 44, 53: “There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption : it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.” “For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now if you are one who is fully consecrated and begotten of God, and if you then continue faithful unto death, your place in the resurrection will be with the heavenly class, changed from human to spirit being. This is what is known as the chief or first resurrection. There will not be very many of this class; for Jesus stated that there would be just a small number. (Luke 12:32) And when the Lord sets up His kingdom the opportunity for participation in the first or chief resurrection ceases.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>All the Other Dead</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HERE are millions who have died who never knew the name of Christ. There are millions living now on earth who do not know of God’s plan of salvation. There are many millions who have died in infancy who could not have known. Is there hope for such ? I answer from the Scriptures in the language of Jesus: “</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font5"> that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth.” (John 5:28) The apostle Paul plainly says in 2 Timothy 4:1 that the Lord Jesus Christ comes to judge the living and the dead; first those who are living on the earth, and thereafter all the dead must be awakened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Christ, Head and Body, is spoken of in the Scriptures as those who participate in the first resurrection; and such are called God’s elect, in whom He delights. God purposes to use Christ during His reign to bring the dead out of their tombs and to bless them who yet have life on the earth. The tomb is spoken of by the prophets as the prison-house of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah speaks then to His Christ, saying (Isaiah 42: 6, 7; 49: 8), “I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.” “I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures further state that the very purpose of Christ’s reign is to restore to man that which he has lost. Adam lost for himself and his children the right to live on earth as perfect human beings in complete happiness. Those who have died have gone away into the land of the enemy. In the resurrection they shall be brought back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning the blessings, then, the scripture reads: “Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you; whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3:19-21) All the prophets foretold this time of restoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Answering my question then, Where will you be in the resurrection? The only other place you have an opportunity to be is on the earth: and this opportunity will be given to all who are not of the heavenly class. All who are obedient to the Lord shall then be restored to perfect condition of body, mind, health, and everything incident thereto. Without a single exception the prophets of Jehovah foretold this time. God’s prophecies must be fulfilled.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Our Lord’s Second Presence Has Begun</span></h6>
<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">INCE we see that restoration blessings must take place during the presence of the Lord, as we have heretofore pointed out, the Lord’s second presence has now begun. The first work of His presence is to establish on earth a righteous government and to deal with the peoples who are now on earth, giving them an opportunity to obey; and those who do obey Him shall live and shall not die. Since we have reached the time of Christ’s presence, and since His kingdom is at the door, it can be truly said that millions now living will never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have come to that great dispensational change when the Lord will bring to man the things that he has long desired, a perfect home, and perfect happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Concerning this same time Jehovah’s prophet Daniel (12:1, 2) specifically said: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of them that sleep ill the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The statement here is that they sleep in the 'dust of the earth. Some awaken to everlasting life and happiness, while some will awaken to lasting contempt. Can you imagine who will be the most contemptible person on earth? Satan has spent many centuries blinding the minds of the people concerning God’s love and His plan of redemption. He has employed certain men, who have told the people that God is a fiend, that God has a great lake of fire and brimstone to burn all who do not come up to His standard. Many have used this to frighten great multitudes into an organization, merely to take from them their money. Does it not appear that these will be in contempt who have deliberately so done ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this time there is no occasion for any intelligent man on earth to tell the people that hell is a place of eternal torment, and that there is no place of salvation except in heaven. The time has come for the Bible to be understood, and it can be understood by all who try to understand it. He, then, who would deliberately mislead mankind as to God’s wonderful arrangement for man’s own future hope, would surely be in contempt when the people thoroughly learn the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But even such may have a chance of recovery. You can think of no more wicked thing than to misrepresent Jehovah God, and such are represented in the Bible as being wicked. Some may have done this ignorantly; but if they turn away from their wickedness and strive to do right they shall be restored, as we read in the prophecy (Ezekiel 18 : 27, 28): “When the wicked man tumeth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he.shall save his soul alive. Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be a happy time on earth when the people begin to learn that their beloved dead are coming back to them. They will begin to make ■ preparation for them. Those ’who are living will be putting their houses in order. The Scriptures show that they will be praying that their loved ones may come back; and the Lord will hear them and awaken the dead out of the tomb, and they will return to their loved ones on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We know that it will be a joyful time; for the prophet Isaiah in 35:10 says: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with song’s and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During that time ignorance and superstition will be removed from the minds of the people. This is now represented by a vail spread over all the nations and peoples of earth, .and concerning it the Prophet says in Isaiah 25:7,8: “And he wall destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth; for the Lord hath spoken it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing then that God has such a marvelous way for redeeming and blessing mankind we can appreciate the words of St. John who wrote: “God is love.” In other words, God lias done all of this for the human race unselfishly for their benefit. A knowledge of the truth broadens the mind, makes one more unselfish, and creates a greater desire in the heart to do good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the earth is filled with a knowledge of the glory of the Lord and of His loving kindness, there will be no necessity for such a system as we have now, wherein a great number of the people are employed to spy upon and watch others. A restored people, having the spirit of the Lord, prompted by unselfishness, will be doing good to each other; all will be happy, and the earth will indeed be a fit habitation for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let all, then, who are m sorrow, take courage. Let their hearts be comforted with a knowledge of the fact that the kingdom of the Lord is at hand, and that the blessings He intends for the people will surely soon begin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">With issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">' <sup>4w</sup>Such -is the'-ease. Jesus said that an office had-been provided for such a special messenger and that at the time of His second appearing He would appoint some one to that office and give him the responsibility of dispensing meat to'the household of faith in due season. The Christian’s meat iri 'due season is a proper explanation of the Scriptures as they become due to be understood. We mark a wonderful fulfilment of this statement of the Lord as further corroborative proof of the’Lord’s second presence from 1874 forward. lie’had said, in answer to the question relative to his second presence: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler . over all his . goods.” —Matthew 24:45-47. - — &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>417</sup>About 1870 Charles Taze Bussell of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, then a truly consecrated Christian and a careful student of God’s Word; learned from the Scriptures that God. has a great and harmonious plan for the salvation and blessing of mankind. Like other earnest watchers, he was looking for the’ evidences of the Lord’s coming. About 1875, while carefully and prayerfully studying the Scriptures, he became convinced of the'Lord’s second presence, resulting in his writing and publishing a booklet entitled, “The Object and Manner of Our Lord’s Return,” which had a phenomenal circulation amongst the Christian people of the world! In 1879 he began the publication of a journal, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Zions Watch Tower and Herald of. Christ’s Presence,</span><span class="font5"> which has since been issued regularly twice each month. This is the first and only publication that for more than forty years has announced the second presence of the Lord. This journal is devoted exclusively to discussion of Scriptural questions, being the means of carrying the food to the household of faith in due season. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>438</sup> Then. followed the. great, work of gathering together the true followers of Christ Jesus, regardless of denomination, sect, kindred, or tongue. Charles Taze Russell, who afterwards became better known as Pastor Russell, was the greatest preacher of modern times. He was elected pastor of upwards of 1,200 congregations at one time. He traveled all over the earth proclaiming the message of the divine plan of the ages, particularly calling attention of Chris-’ tians to the presence of the Lord. Between the . years 1881 and 1904 he wrote and published in six volumes the Studies in the Scriptures giving a full and detailed<sup>1</sup> explanation of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. various features of the. divine plan. These books were translated into about thirty languages and their combined circulation exceeded 11,000,000 copies. In 1917' the seventh volume of the series of Studies in'the Scriptures was published, .known as “The Finished Mystery”, which has had a very wide circulation. These books are the first clear explanation of the di- -vine plan ever published,. In. addition to the above, he published and widely ■ circulated va- . rious booklets, “What Say the Scriptures about Hell?” “Spiritism,” “The Bible Versus Evolution,” “Tabernacle Shadows,” and many other. . tracts, pamphlets, etc. He was the author of the Photo-Drama of Creation, as well as the scenario used for this drama, which gives an outline of the divine plan from the creation to the times of restitution. lie organized and conducted a lecture bureau which employed a large force of Bible lecturers who traveled and who yet travel throughout the world, proclaiming the snessage of the divine plan.</span></p>
