<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Teaching the Young</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">F</span><span class="font5">ROM earliest times the Hebrews have been the best educated people in the world. “Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians” (Acts 7:</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">22),</span><span class="font5"> and he seems to have instilled thoroughly into his followers the desirability of education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The command to write the words of the Law “upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9) implies a general knowledge, an ability to read and write at a time when the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons were' naked savages and cannibals. Moses’ instructions to the elders of Israel that after his death they should, on Mount Ebal, “write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly” (Deuteronomy 27:8), is an assurance that the elders could write and that the people could read; and it shows a desire that the people should have opportunity to study their laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The natural adaptability of the Hebrews to instruction, and the Lord’s blessing upon their efforts to learn, are seen in the superiority of Daniel and his companions over their heathen comrades, and also in the wisdom of Solomon which “excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.”—1 Kings 4: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The schools of the prophets are often mentioned, and there are references to teachers and pupils. (1 Chronicles 25:7,8) Tradition had it that every synagogue was used as a school, with a teacher over every twenty-five children; and that colleges were maintained in every country in which the Jews resided. Gamaliel conducted one of these, at Jerusalem. Teachers were treated with great respect, and both pupils and teachers were exhorted to respect each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unlike some so-called religious teachers of today, the teachers in the days of Nehemiah “read in the book of the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to under-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">stand the reading.” (Nehemiah 8: 8) Our Lord was the greatest teacher that ever lived. He caused men to think. The true Christian Church is a teaching organization, an organization of Bible Students.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>History of Secular Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font5">HILE we have had continuous religious education from the days of Moses, the history of secular education has been broken. Many diverse schools have risen and fallen among the same nationalities. The Greeks spread education over the ancient world. A painting on an ancient Greek vase shows one boy reciting, another fingering a lyre, and a third working with an abacus calculating machine, with a teacher supervising all three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The oldest existing university is that of Cairo, Egypt, founded in the year 988, and still attended by 9,000 students. The students in this university give frequent concern to the British empire. They want Egypt for the Egyptians. Forty of the leading universities of Europe were established coincident with the discovery of America and the dawn of the Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the United States, Harvard University is the oldest institution of learning, having been founded in 1636. Yale University was founded in 1701. As far back as 1642 a compulsory law was enacted in Massachusetts, inflicting penalties on parents for the neglect of education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is rather humiliating to find that in the matter of education the United States occupies the ninth place on the list, with most of the civilized nations of the earth ahead of us. The United States has the shortest school day, the shortest school week, and the shortest school year of any country. This is not to its glory, but to its shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the World War twenty percent of the men drafted into the army were illiterates. In the first selective draft there were 700,000 of these; and according to Secretary of the Interior Lane, the Government had to spend millions of dollars in teaching men the meaning of the words “forward” and “halt”. In view of the fact that in the United States ninety-three percent of all the federal revenues are for war seemingly it might pay, even from the war standpoint alone, to spend a little less for war and more for education. In the German army there was only one illiterate in 5,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Up to the year 1911 there were two illiterates per thousand of the population in Denmark, two in Norway, three in Sweden, one hundred twenty-two in Ireland, one hundred sixty-one in France, two hundred forty-eight in Belgium, four hundred twenty-nine in Austria, six hundred fifteen in Italy, six hundred thirty-seven in Spain, six hundred thirty-seven in Serbia, seven hundred twenty-five in Russia, seven hundred ninety-two in Portugal, and eight hundred three in Rumania. Germany may be said to have no illiterates. Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden are Protestant countries, and Ireland is partly Protestant. The other countries named are either Roman Catholic or Greek Catholic.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Illiteracy in the United States</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">N THE United States there are forty-six illiterates in each one thousand native whites, and one hundred twenty-eight illiterates in each one thousand foreign-born whites. New York City’s illiterates amount to 281,121, with 425,022 in the state unable to read or write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On account of the fact that the United States have some 5,000,000 illiterates, George Bernard Shaw, the famous London critic, gets huge enjoyment from repeating the observation that the United States are not a civilized country. However, there is some encouragement in the fact that from 1910 to 1920 the percentage of illiteracy in the country as a whole dropped from 7.7 percent to 6 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an illustration of the appalling illiteracy which prevails in such great industrial states as Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois, the Nashville </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Tennessean</span><span class="font5"> relates an incident which happened at the trial of Pluckham and Kavanaugh, in Brooklyn, for erecting a theatre which collapsed, causing the death of seven persons. Asked, “Did you build this theatre in a haphazard manner?” Mr. Kavanaugh said: ‘‘Yes”; and had to have it explained to him that “haphazard” does not mean “All right”, as he had supposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Uncle Jerry Rusk, first American Secretary of Agriculture, when acknowledging the gratitude of the people of Wisconsin, whom he served well and long, not only in Washington but in the gubernatorial chair of Wisconsin, made the modest and truthful, if not altogether grammatical, statement: “I only seen my duty and went and done it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Loss in productive power because of illiteracy is said to cost the United States $825,000,000 annually.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE most progressive section of the United States in the matter of education consists of the seventeen states which lie to the north and west of Missouri, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. The average educational efficiency of these states is rated in the “Literary Digest’’ at 60.0 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next most progressive section in the matter of education consists of the sixteen states lying to the north and east of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The average educational efficiency of these states is rated in the “Literary Digest” at 55.6 percent. The average standing of Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the Canal Zone is 49.3 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next on the list is the Southwest, consisting of Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. The average educational efficiency of these states is rated at 42.0 percent; and the balance of the country at 33.4 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Kansas and South Dakota, though listed in the first section, have standings of 55.2 percent and 55.0 percent respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New Jersey, District of Columbia, and Massachusetts, though listed in the second section, have an efficiency of over 60 percent each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The four states with excess of Negro population, South Carolina, Mississippi, North Caro-lini and Alabama, have an average of but 30.1 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Appalachian mountains, covering parts of Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky, are about 5,000,000 native-born Americans, the descendants of English, Scotch, and Irish pioneers, who are now illiterates. It was poverty that drove them to this condition. In some counties in Kentucky there are people who have never seen a railroad; and in Round, Caney Creek and Knott counties only ten years ago there were no schools at all. This condition is being gradually corrected, however.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Educational Rights of Children</span></h6>
<div><img src="g_E_19250211_files/g_E_19250211-3.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">O READ some of the court decisions one would think that the principal right of a child is to go to work in a factory during the years when he should be in school. But children do not come into this world by accident; and every generation owes to its children a decent education, as preparation for the duties which the State will impose upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are twenty million boys and girls in the elementary schools of the United States, but only ten percent to twelve percent of them go beyond those grades. The moment the law permits them to do so 66 percent leave school for work. Only 14 percent finish high school. In many districts the laws are not enforced, and not more than half of the children required by law to be in school are actually there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1800 the average citizen of the United States got along with eighty-two days of schooling. In 1900 he had 1,046 days, and it is none too much. There is far greater need of education now than then. The problems of the average man are much greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The child is father to the man. When the child leaves school, he takes his education along with him into business. Sometimes what he takes is very small, as the following answers to questions put to children reveal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In 1620 the Pilgrims crossed the ocean, and this is known as Pilgrim’s Progress.” “A vacuum is a large empty space where the Pope lives.” “Shakespeare founded ‘As You Like It’ on a poem previously written by Sir Oliver Lodge.” “Benjamin Franklin produced electricity by rubbing cats backward.” “Woodrow Wilson wrote Sherlock Holmes.” “In India a man out of a cask may not marry a woman out of another cask.” “The salaries of the teachers are paid from the dog tax.” “A man who looks on the bright side of things is called an optimist, but a pianist looks on the dark side.’ “Shakespeare was a great writer, only he used too many familiar quotations.” “Gender shows whether a man is masculine, feminine or neuter.” “An abstract noun is something you can’t see when you are looking at it.” “The eyes are located in the obituary cavity.” “The brain is a soft bunch covered with wrinkles.” “Gravitation is that which, if there were none, we should all fly away.” “I don’t know anything about the Constitution, as I was born in Kansas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The college boys do not do so much better. One of them spelled difficult as “defulliculi”; another made senate read “cinirnt”; agreement came out “arogremt”, while heir appeared as “eare”. Few, relatively, can spell “which” and “separate” correctly. “Privilege” is a sticker for many in college and out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the entrance examinations the students of Newcomb College made it known that “climate is caused by the emotion of the earth around the sun.” “Armageddon is a language composed of cords.” “Genesis is a character in Booth Tarkington’s novel entitled ‘Seventeen’.” “The Beatitudes are the first ten books of the Bible.” “Methuselah is the oldest city in the world, 3,-000 years old.” “Esperanto is a ship about which there was some trouble during the World War.” “Luther Burbank started the Lutheran faith.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The Rush for Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">O ONE can deny that there is an intense longing for education on the part of mil</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">lions of the American people. Even in spite of the unsatisfactory results obtained, it is yet true that more is spent in this country for educational purposes, per capita, than elsewhere on the planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In New York city the enrollment of students in 1923 amounted to 20,379, in New York University and 32,769 in Columbia University; and the figures were still larger in 1924. From 1914 to 1920 the number of college students in the country as a whole increased from 187,000 to 294,000. One city is planning for a single college that will have 60,000 students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the public schools in 1900 the average daily attendance was 10,632,772; and the total cost for that year was $212,964,6.18, or $20.22 per pupil. In the same schools in 1920 the attendance was 16,248,997; and the expense was $1,039,385,055, or $63.96 per pupil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This looks very encouraging, and it is encouraging. Yet in South Carolina, in 1920, the expense per pupil was only $19.99; and the total hill of $1,039,385,055 looks very small for a nation that has an annual luxury bill of $22,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In New York state the annual bill for gasoline is more than for teachers’ salaries; and the investment in automobiles is three times as great as the investment in schoolhouses. The total expense of educating the average child is only $360 per annum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is great difference in what certain localities can do in the matter of maintaining schools. There is- one county in Arkansas where the school term is only 77 days, but in another county in the same state the school term is 168 days. The average teacher’s salary varies from $256 in the lowest state to $1,012 in the highest state.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Compensating the Teachers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">N THE grand rush of the one hundred percent profit Americans during and immediately after the World War, there was a year or so in which the teachers were almost completely overlooked. As a result 120,000 of them gave up teaching, through necessity, and went into other work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States Bureau of Education compiled a statement of what happened to some of these. A commercial teacher at $2,400 left to take up accounting work at $5,000; a dairying teacher at $2,750 is now getting $16,000; an expert mining engineer at $3,000 is now in commercial work at $10,000; a teacher in medicine at $2,250 is now in manufacturing at $6,000; one in engineering at $2,500 is now with an illuminating company at $4,000; a teacher of English at $1,500 is nowan advertising manager at $5,000; a geologist at $1,800 is now in the oil business at $10,000; and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Lancaster, Pa., eighty-two of the teachers, after futile appeals to the school board for a living wage, joined the American Federation of Labor, and lost their positions. Probably they should have been willing to teach patriotism free of charge, or for $1 a year, like some of the patrioteers thqt served us during the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in the Cleveland </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Plain Dealer,</span><span class="font5"> who had not yet lost his sense of humor, published the following advertisement in that paper in 1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Wanted—</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">young lady teacher for room of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">thirty </span><span class="font3">to forty pupils of all descriptions, capable of making shining lights out of every one of them, prepared </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">teach all branches, instruct in matters of health, wealth and wisdom, possessing all the virtues of a first-class policeman, watchman, fireman, bulldog and minister, be a good musician, a social leader, active in community welfare, an all around church member, teach Sunday school class, sing in the choir, attend lodge, make friends with everybody and ruffle the feathers of nobody, and other things too numerous to mention. Will be required to attend state and county conventions at her own expense, given two weeks’ vacation during the holidays without pay, also summer months to attend more school and absorb more ‘latest ideas’ in peda-gogism. Board can be had for $8 and room at $3 a week; church, charity and lodge dues reasonable; laundry, railroad fare and all sundry expenses </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font3">pensive. Send in about ten pounds of recommendations, college and normal certificates, and other credentials; also handsome photograph, and postage for their </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font3">turn when we are through mussing them up. Come and make a personal exhibit of yourself. Board will consider all competitors and reserves the right to choose ad libitum. Position will pay $60 a month till another teacher can be found who will take it for less.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The college professors were hit hard, too, not only in America but everywhere. There are twenty-two vacant chairs in the University of Vienna, once the Mecca of students from every quarter of the globe. A former professor of one of the German universities is selling newspapers on the streets of Berlin, not being able to live on the salary now offered a professor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two noble-minded college presidents in America are known to have refused increases of their own salaries because they knew of professors on their staffs that did not have sufficient incomes to five in comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are Negro teachers in the South that receive as little as $95 a year salary for their work.</span></p>

Chalk dust causes considerable laryngitis and acute bronchitis, and there is i some predisposition to tuberculosis and heart; disease among teachers, but taken as a whole the teacher’s lot is an enviable one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a grand privilege to be in constant contact with the young, to guide, encourage and help the most ardent, enthusiastic and ambitious among us, to stimulate them, to repress them, to partake of their hopes and their spirit, to be a comrade and a confidant of boys and girls, the most interesting things in the whole wide world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Money is not all there is to life. Teachers do not get any too much of that, but they get something which is better. They have three months’ rest in summer, two weeks at Christmas time, one week at Easter, two days out of every seven, and two hours out of every day. This leisure time gives them opportunity for self-improvement which others spend in labor. Of course they must have this time, because of the rush of new sciences, with which they are at all times expected to keep abreast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Princeton University professors can retire on half-pay after they reach the age of fifty-five, or they may continue to teach until the age of sixty-eight, if they wish, after which time retirement is automatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1920 a teacher in New York City, Miss J. Fash, reached the age of seventy years and was placed on the pension list by the Board of Education after fifty-two years continuous service as a teacher in the Bronx. In 1922 a teacher in Long Island City was pensioned after having taught fifty-four years in the same school which she herself had attended as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A professor-at-large is Railroad Jack, who has hoboed in thirty-eight states, lecturing on historic characters from curbstone corners. He knows 10,000 dates about 5,000 famous characters in history and answers any historical question offhand. Whenever he visits Ann Arbor, the site of Michigan State University, the students assess themselves five cents apiece for each lecture, and say that they get one thousand percent on the investment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over a million children in the country are taught by mere boys and girls, who have but elementary educations themselves, and who have had no training for their important work. No civilized country has teachers who, as a group, are less educated and less well trained professionally. Of the teachers of Massachusetts 85 percent have had normal school training, while only 25 percent of the teachers of Kansas have had such training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">New York State has 60,000 teachers, 8,000 of whom retire each year. The growth of population calls for 1,500 more teachers, so that there are openings every year for 9,500 teachers in this one state.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">CENTURY ago, and even less in some districts, the schoolmaster was expected to flog recreant children as a matter of course. Indeed, it is much less than that since the Editor, with twenty-five others, was flogged by one of the finest teachers and one of the best men he ever knew, for engaging in a snowball battle in an area forbidden for that purpose. Just to see that teacher once more, and to shake his faithful hand, would be worth a dozen floggings such as he gave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To be caught on the street after nine at night, or smoking, or using bad language, or doing any one of a dozen other things such as a more or less bad boy might do, meant to get a strapping the next day in the library, coupled with some fatherly advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some schools in the country there are still closets under the chimney where bad boys may think it over and decide when they will be good and on what terms. In certain English schools a large wicker cage is preserved in which the delinquent was fastened, the cage being then drawn by a pulley to the ceiling, where it remained until the ill-doer was supposed to be ready to be received back into society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now all that has passed, although we do read in the papers of a teacher in Minnesota who tried to soften the ardor of some of his pupils by shocking them in a modified electric chair; and of another in New York, who beat up a little Negro' girl with a piece of rubber hose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What we see in the papers now is on the other side of the question. The students of Syracuse University demand time off to celebrate a football victory; they go on strike, handle professors roughly, and are fined $2 each. At Hudson Falls 250 high school students refused to enter the school building, and paraded through the streets, demanding the resignation of the principal because he slapped a girl’s face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Cape May the students went on the warpath and locked all the teachers in the restroom. 'At Gloucester City they went on strike because they resented the suspension of a teacher who had talked to them too plainly on sex matters. At Oakland they went on strike because the class honors were won by a brilliant young Japanese girl.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A AT </span><span class="font5">HEN the so-called greatest men of our so-’ • called civilization resort to the law of the jungle every few years to settle their differences, it is not to be wondered at that their sons resort to the same law; but it is to be regretted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Marquis of Salisbury, who three times became premier of the British Empire, writing from the school at Eton, at the age of fourteen, said: “I am bullied from morning to night without ceasing. I am obliged to hide myself all the evening in some corner to prevent being bullied; and if I dare venture from my room, I get it directly. When I come in to dinner they kick and shin me, and I am obliged to go away from dinner without eating anything.” Anybody that sees anything cute or boyish about such devilish practices is welcome to his joy. Such conduct is worse than heathenish, worse than barbarous. No heathen nor barbarian ’would do such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Youths with all the hopes of their parents locked up in them have been killed in hazings at Cornell, Syracuse, Northwestern, and many other universities; and yet hazings continue in institutions all over the country. Only two years ago the sophomores of Rutgers College broke up a freshmen’s dinner at a local hotel, destroying a dinner that had cost $404.50 to prepare and causing damage to the hotel to the amount of $1,500. At a freshman-sophomore class fight at the University of Wisconsin, eight students were severely injured as a result of bombs made of sulphuric acid and other chemicals. Even at such institutions as Princeton and Lafayette the upper classmen impose restrictions as to how the freshmen must dress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foolish theory of hazing is that it teaches the freshmen to be manly, and that it will cause them to stick together, so that when they get »ut in the world they will more or less cling to one another and be a help in business or professional life. Hazing is a thing of the past at the great university at Cambridge, England, and at Harvard University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What-may happen where students are permitted to attack one another was revealed in an investigation of the truant school at Chicago, where it was brought to light that one of the boys at the school was beaten to death by other boys in the presence of a teacher and upon his instructions. In the same school another lad of fourteen was tied with a clothes-line, and beaten almost into insensibility for a minor infraction of the rules.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Physical Training vs. Professional Athletics</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">TO HE average college student does not get too much physical training, but too little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trouble at present is that a few men virtually represent the college as professional athletes, while the average student sits on a bench and yells, not as a participant in outdoor sports, but merely as an observer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several of the great universities have seriously considered the abandonment of all athletic contests. They are costly and wasteful of academic energy, necessitating the maintenance of young navies and other battalions; and they do not promote health. The coaches of the teams get more money and are more honored than are the teachers and professors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the close supervision of naval authorities, the athletes at Annapolis have slightly better standings in their studies than the other midshipmen; and they show a far greater permanence in the service. The president of the University of Illinois has proposed that athletic records should count for degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the subjects in the curriculum of Stanford University is yell leading. This is ridiculous, of course, but there is a certain philosophy back of it. See how the American people were rah-rah-rah’d into the World War, and uttered no word of protest.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Religion in Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5">N EDUCATION without any religion in it, or without any religious basis, is no education at all. The world has not yet recovered from the shock caused by Leopold and Loeb, the two highly educated youths in Chicago who murdered a neighbor’s son because they wanted a new sensation. One of these young men was a brilliant linguist. Both were sons of millionaires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The way the matter stands today in the higher institutions of learning in the United States, eighty-five percent of the students enter with a definite belief in God; but when they reach their senior year less than fifty percent have such a belief. A splendid Christian woman bemoaned the fact that every one of her boys went away to college believers in Christ, and came back to her an infidel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A college student wrote to his parents: “If I had been a Chinaman or a Hindu attending the university, I would not have known from any remarks in the class room that I was living in a nominally Christian country. Very many hours have been given to discussions of heathen philosophers, but not a single moment to the teachings of Christ.” We feel like adding in the words of the Master: “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s and of the holy angels.”—Luke 9: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tests have been taken in some of the universities to see how much the students do actually know about the Bible. In the University of Nebraska one hundred thirty-nine students were quizzed. Seven percent could not name a single book of the Old Testament; eight and one-half percent could not name a single book of the New Testament; less than half of the students could name ten books altogether. Similar results were obtained in the University of North Dakota. In the latter institution certain books were identified as follows: Deuteromy, Deuter-omoty, Deuteromeny, Deuterominy, Goshut, Salms, Nehimiah, Joob and Jobe, while Hezekiah was named as one of the books of Moses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So exasperated was one parent at these conditions that he made the statement: “If I had an unconverted son or daughter, I would rather he go to the penitentiary that the university; for at the penitentiary he would receive religious training, and at the university none.” This parent, Rev. F. P. Dennison, D.D., does not see where the trouble really lies. It really lies with the clergy themselves. They have done all possible to discourage Bible Study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Scriptures in the public schools before beginning the school work of the day, there has been at various times considerable agitation to continue or to restore this practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are now eleven states, with a population of 70,000,000, that prohibit Bible reading in the public schools; thirty, with a population of 14,000,000, where the Bible may be read in the schools; and seven states providing by law that it must be read. In California the courts have just prohibited the King James Version, on the ground that it teaches a particular creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum</span><span class="font5"> states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I was active some years ago in helping to pass the Bible reading bill in New Jersey—a law brought into being by the activities of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics and other patriotic orders. This law provided for the reading of ten verses from the Old Testament without comment, in order that the Bible reading should be completely unsectarian. Shortly after the law went into effect, it became known that some teachers would take the same ten verses and read them day after day; others would select objectionable verses from Deuteronomy to read to the children. Needless to add that these teachers were opposed to reading the Bible, and that they were possibly under instruction to make the law ludicrous or useless.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pittsburgh </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette Times</span><span class="font5"> voices a generally accepted and growing view when it says that “there is a time and place for everything; a time and place for education, and for religious instruction. The school is no place to teach the Bible or religion, and the pulpit is no place to teach geography or politics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are spasmodic efforts by clergymen in various localities to try to bring about the allotment of certain hours each week to religious instruction, within which hours the children would be assorted according to the wishes of their parents and turned over to clergymen for instruction. This idea was imported from Quebec. The plan is being tried out in Oregon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">GREAT political force working day and night, and always under ground, to destroy the public school system of the United States is that institution of the earth, earthy, which is called the Roman Catholic Church. It has six lines along which it works to bring about this ruin, listed by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum </span><span class="font5">as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(1) By bringing the public school into contempt </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font3">characterizing it as 'godless,’ 'vicious,’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">'a </span><span class="font3">sink </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">corruption,’ etc. (2) The securing for the Catholid parochial school the largest possible share of the public school tax funds. (3) The encouraging of other Beets to start sectarian schools and to demand public moneys in payment for the secular education of the children. (4) The securing of a Catholic majority on school boards and on the teaching staff of the public schools in the hope of being able thereby to lower the tone of instruction and discipline in the public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(5) Securing the employment of monks and nuns </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font3">public school teachers. (6) The prevention of normal training of public school teachers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The public school system of Maryland is entirely in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church, not a single school official in that state being elected by the votes of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yale University has a chaplain assigned for the religious instruction of Roman Catholic students in that institution, while a Catholic professor has been appointed to the chair of scholastic philosophy at Harvard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prison records show that in spite of friendly Roman Catholic police and magistrates the parochial schools have furnished sixty-five percent of the criminals of this country, and the public schools five percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is freely admitted in the public debates on immigration in the House of Representatives and the Senate that the least desirable citizens of the United States come from countries where the domination of the Roman Catholic Church is most complete and effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The average illiteracy in the seven solidly Roman Catholic countries of Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Brazil and Guatemala is 61.86 percent. These facts tell their own story.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Morals and Education</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Nicholas Murray Butler recites six traits which distinguish the educated man</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19250211_files/g_E_19250211-9.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">from his fellows: “Good English, refined manners, correct standards of feeling and appreciation, power of reflection, power of growth, and ability to do efficiently without nervous agitation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will be noted that Dr. Butler said nothing about morals. He is a well-posted man and knows that there are now 7,000 college-bred persons in American prisons; and that back of every gigantic fraud, every public crime, every perversion of the law, are the educated brains of college men. Dean Jones of Yale believes that we are approaching a moral crisis, and he does not think it can be avoided by education. Dr. Fitch, of Amherst, says: “The average undergraduate is nothing more or less than a very complicated ass.” He ought to know what he is turning out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a well-known fact that the blame for the World War is justly laid at the door of the educational methods of European universities. War is the greatest of all crimes, because it is murder raised to the nth power. Here is reason enough not to anticipate any great moral development to result from secular education. It is merely a polishing process. It does not and can not change the material that is being polished. A polished diamond remains a diamond; a polished cobble-stone is still a stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in “The World Tomorrow”, after studying the moral complex of hundreds of school children, sets forth the following code as representing that of ninety percent of America’s youth. It is not a pleasant picture. Over half of the children are found to cheat, lie and steal; and their whole outlook on life is unmoral:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(1) Stealing physical property is always wrong. (2) Cheating in the state regents examination is wrong. (3) Cheating in local examinations and forging a parent’s name are ideally wrong, but excusable under stress of circumstances. (4) Misrepresentation in business is normal, except as directed against one’s partner or employer. (5) Cheating in daily school work, such as copying of another’s composition or problem and handing it in as original, does not stamp a boy or girl as dishonest and is occasionally indulged in by all but saints or eccentrics. (6) A lie is wrong only when it is told to injure some one. Everyone tells lies to save himself or others from unpleasantness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Somebody with a liking for statistics has dug out the fact that there are 11,000 young people studying Greek in the secondary schools of the country, while the aggregate total attendance of young people at the 786 licensed dance halls of New York City alone amounts to 6,113,604, with the average patron present sixty times a year. Of the Princeton students eighty percent use tobacco and two-thirds use alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who among us has not been benefited by the wise counsels of really good teachers, who desired to make us good and useful men and women ? But who among us can doubt that the real place for boys and girls to be trained in manners and character is at home ? If the home influences are not right, the chance of the boy or girl turning out better than the parents is remote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop Candler, of the Methodist Church South, says truthfully:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Enlightenment does not reduce crime. It increases many crimes, as for example, such crimes as forgery, embezzlement, and larceny after trust. There are not </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">few offenses which the educated only are capable of committing. . . . All history shows that licentiousness has been most prevalent in periods of greatest enlightenment. Such was the case with Babylon, with the Grecian republics, and with the Roman commonwealth. . . . We may easily have too much education unless that education is purified by religious faith and pervaded by moral principle. Otherwise we may bring to pass a high-powered world, and the power of its own mighty momentum will rush it to self-destruction.”</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19250211_files/g_E_19250211-10.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">0 EDUCATE means to “draw out”; but it means to put in, too. Something can be drawn out of a barrel that has been filled, but not out of an empty one. The true object of education is neither to increase production nor to develop a governing class. It is to awaken in all the power to think logically, to develop powers of discernment and construction, to cultivate sympathy, generosity, large-heartedness and honesty in every direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A study of current literature betrays a desire on the part of some to curtail the education of the masses. They seem to think it has gone too far. Roman Catholicism is back of this desire. It foresees trouble for itself if the enlightenment of its supporters gets beyond the elementary stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attitude of big business is revealed in the following from Commerce </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and Finance,</span><span class="font5"> one of itjS recognized mouthpieces:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In stating that the cost of our public school system has increased from $140,000,000 in 1890 to $1,000,000,000 in 1920, it [The Carnegie Foundation </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for the </span><span class="font3">Advancement of Teaching] seriously questions whether the country can afford to go on paying this great </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tax </span><span class="font3">in view of the results such education is producing. It questions whether or not the expense of maintaining our high schools does not go merely to provide a useless smattering of culture for would-be students who are far better endowed to learn a productive trade than to absorb book knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> also says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“College theories are changing, or rather they have already changed, and at present, almost </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">everywhere </span><span class="font3">restriction in the number of students already </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">has been </span><span class="font3">effected or is in serious contemplation.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Repression of Liberty</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font5">NE of the objects of many American colleges would seem to be to repress the desire of youth to know the truth on all subjects. We have some illustrations of this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scott Nearing was giving an address in Worcester on “The Control of Public Opinion”. The president of Clark University dropped in and found several hundred students there. He dismissed the meeting, and followed it up by excluding from the library two magazines that commented unfavorably upon his act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The president of the University of Michigan ordered the dismissal of a student for writing a favorable review of John Kenneth Turner’s book, “Shall it Be Again?” The University of California expelled a student for publishing an article by Upton Sinclair criticizing the head of * the institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the war the students of this particular university beat into unconsciousness a newsboy, weak, frail and half starved, as well as almost blind, for selling papers they did not approve, and then had him locked up in jail for provoking the attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Board of Education of Los Angeles refused to allow two of the most forward-looking periodicals in the country, “The New Republic” and “The Nation”, to have any place in the school libraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A professor in the University of Copenhagen made the statement to an American:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“You have no academic freedom in America. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">students in our schools, no older than the students in yours, can listen to any speaker they choose for their clubs—anarchist, atheist, bolshevist, nihilist, communist or cannibalist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes the young people here resent the efforts to coddle them, as is revealed in the following resolution passed by the Barnard College Student Council:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Resolved: That there is nothing gained in shielding students during four years from problems and ideas they must face during the rest of their life; that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font3">they are considered incapable of rational judgment upon theories presented to them, the solution lies in further training in scientific method rather than in quarantina from ideas; that a reputation for fearless open-mindedness is more to be desired for an academic institution than material prosperity; that, therefore, we wish to go on record as opposing any form of censorship of the college platform.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The teachers themselves often whimsically refer to these efforts to keep the minds of the young in strait-jackets. Thus Professor Witmer, of the University of Pennsylvania, defined education as “the device of civilization to keep us from encountering problems”; and Professor Overstreet, of New. York College, defines schools as “more or less harmful places of detention for children during their mothers’ busy hours”, and colleges as “merely places of detention during the more annoying period of adolescence”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The World Tomorrow,” longing «for a better world than we have today, and criticizing present tendencies in education, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“If education means the accumulation of facts, the memorizing of certain dates, the possession of certain knowledge at a certain age, then moulds will do. Children can be made to meet certain requirements each year of their school life; and if that be the goal, then our present scheme is working pretty successfully. But if education means growth of body, mind and spirit, the development of initiative, intellectual honesty, open-mindedness, freedom of thought, fearlessness, physical and moral courage, then our educational program can not be built around the mould idea.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>What Education Accomplishes</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. H. G. Wells says bluntly that “it is a modern error that education exists for the individual. Education exists for the community and the race; it exists to subdue the individual for the good of the world and his own ultimate happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an address before the students and faculty of the New York Training School for Teachers the points were raised that no person is educated who can not use his education to support himself and three others; second, an educated person must be able to use the hands as well as the mind; third, an educated person must be a religious person; fourth, an educated person must be physically fit. As the matter now stands, most college men die twenty years before their time because they do not know enough about their bodies to give them decent care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aristotle claimed that the right use of leisure is the chief end of education. Dr. Samuel Johnson once said that the reason why so many men took to drink was because they were not interesting enough to themselves in their hours of leisure to go without it. An educated mind never needs to be amused. It can always amuse itself, while planning useful things for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thomas Edison claims that college men are the best we have but that they might be a great deal better; for his experience with them is that their curiosity has been paralyzed and their powers of observation destroyed. He objects that the colleges do not teach the boys to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tests which have been made by the Teachers’ College show that not ten percent of what is heard in the class room can be reproduced by the pupil immediately afterward. But perhaps it is not to be wondered at that this is so. There is so much to learn, so much to do, that the mind of the average person seeks the easiest way of bearing the burden, by using a note-book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Manchester Guardian</span><span class="font5"> points out that the object of a college education is not merely to enable one to make a better living financially but to enjoy more as he goes along, getting a keener enjoyment out of letters, art and the physical sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The total earnings of an untrained man up to the age of sixty are $45,000; that of a high school graduate $78,000; that of a college graduate $150,000. The professor is at his best at sixty years of age; the laborer has done his best work before he is fifty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Less than one percent of the men in America are college bred; yet this small percentage has furnished fifty-five percent of the American presidents, fifty-four percent of the vice-presidents, sixty-two percent of the secretaries of state, fifty percent of the secretaries of the treasury, and sixty-nine percent of the supreme court justices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the business field the results are similar. One of the bulletins issued under the authority of the United States Department of Education gives a tabulation of the experiences of one hundred business houses over a short period of years. This showed that ninety percent of the college men rose to large salaries and responsible positions, as compared with twenty-five percent of non-college men.</span></p>

Rochie Hardy, Jr., entered Columbia University as a freshman when he was but twelve years of age. This was in 1920. Two years later a Chicago girl eleven years of age entered the same institution, as a freshman. We do not know how these children have fared; but we do know that a few years ago we heard much of a brilliant young man in the vicinity of Boston who is said to be now a clerk in a drug store, cursing the day when he ever went to college at all, because he thinks it has sapped all his vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thomas Edison was never able to pass his school examinations; and when his teacher reported that it was a waste of time to try to educate him, he was taken out of school and never returned. General Ulysses S. Grant, one of the greatest military geniuses of history, was famous for his low standings while at West Point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' Henry Ward Beecher had such powers of oratory that he could and did move to tears in a few minutes a great audience that was hostile when he first faced it. Yet he stood sixty-fourth in an examination in grammar, while the young man who ranked first became a barber in a Southern city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">President Andrew Johnson never went to any kind of school, his father having died when he was five years of age, and his mother being too poor to educate him. Abraham Lincoln had five months’ instruction all told, two months with one teacher and three months with another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A New York business man gives the following report concerning a young fellow that flunked out of one of the principal colleges, being unable to pass certain required examinations. The man said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This boy is a corker, one of the keenest, most alert, and intelligent young chaps I ever saw. He has been with us only a few weeks, but he has invented some of the most valuable report-forms that we have. He has electrified the force with which he works. He exhibits concentration, tireless industry, ability to calculate, make cost estimates, compose interesting, exhaustive and informing reports. He is one of the most valuable and promising young men we have in our force.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One college man in six flunks out, usually from unwillingness to study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">T IS quite a common thing for ambitious young men and women to work their way through college, and not infrequently these young men and women succeed remarkably well in after life. But as one of the boys put it, a boy who tries it “has most of the joy and all of the culture taken out of his college life”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a boy or a girl is working his way, time is necessarily stolen from meals and from sleep; and there is absolutely no time at all for recreation. Most educators do not take well to the idea, seeming to think that the education is not worth such an effort; and perhaps they are right.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">PROFESSOR in the University of Chicago made the statement that “university examinations are barbarous and ridiculous survivals of the dark ages, and should be abolished.” Nevertheless the system of testing the student’s progress and his tenacity of purpose by examinations still meets with the general approval of educators, and is not likely to be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Summer vacations are survivals of the days when farmer boys had to stay out of school to help with the tilling and harvesting of crops; but there is ho reason now why the young should be set adrift, especially in the cities. But the schools during the midsummer should be conducted in the parks, and the subjects changed. Educators say that the long summer vacations in cities make the boys bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fraternities have been barred by law in eighteen states. Secret societies are supposed to encourage wider friendships in college, and this is generally held to be one of the greatest assets of college training. But it is not necessary to be in a secret society with a person to think well of him or to associate with him; and the general consensus of opinion is that it is not good for young people to be in secret societies together. Deviltry is easy under such conditions. Three Brooklyn schoolgirls were recently burned with acid in a secret-society initiation in that city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HUNDRED and fifty years ago, if a woman was taught to read and sew it was considered that she was well educated. The wills made by women of property at that time show that few of them knew how to write. The schools were intended only for the boys. Women’s college were first founded a hundred years ago, and under strong opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Co-education of the sexes is now widely practised in the United States, although it is admittedly unwise, having the effect of feminizing the men and masculinizing the women, and bringing too many hasty and forced marriages, resulting in great unhappiness to all concerned. In the high schools of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans the sexes are separated; but in most other cities they are not. Economy is the motive in co-education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Women study harder and have better memories than men. The men excel in science and mathematics; the women in literature, language and other studies requiring concentration. Plans are being made in New England to establish a woman’s college in which mathematics, Latin, Greek and pure science will give way to studies especially appropriate for those sensible women who expect ultimately to become mothers and the founders of beautiful and happy homes. But a good mother beats all colleges for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The women of Heidelberg University are said to be unhappy because they are not permitted to engage in dueling as do the men. Michigan College has sent home seventeen girls for smoking and staying out after hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">British schoolmasters assert that women teachers are demoralizing the youth of America. They do not know what they are talking about. Women teachers, especially those that have been mothers, make the best of teachers in the elementary grades. Men should teach boys over twelve years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mrs. J. W. Shad, of Pittsburgh, mother of four, with a large house to keep up, found time to take an academic course in the night high school, where she was graduated with the highest honors of her class. Mrs. Amy Davis Winship, of Racine, Wisconsin, entered the University of Wisconsin as a student at the age of ninety.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">VERY year witnesses improvements in the means of caring for the health of children while at school. Every New York school has at least one room open to the weather, in which children with tubercular tendencies may be rendered robust. As a consequence tuberculosis is diminishing. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With the same end in view, a mid-morning milk lunch has been provided for children in the lower grades. This also has proved its value, in Dallas the school officials feed 20,000 children at a profit, supplying a forty-cent chicken stew for five cents, and ice-cream and salad for five cents. For ten cents the student receives a meal that would cost seventy-five cents in a restaurant. If that is a good thing for the children of Dallas, why would it not be a good thing for the children of every city? How could any city make a better move?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To reduce the effects of malnutrition many German communities have established schools in the woods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Modifications of the Dalton Laboratory Plan, first tried out in Dalton, Massachusetts, are in operation in three thousand English schools, and in some seventy schools in this country. Under this plan there are no classroom recitations, but the children are dealt with individually. In Winnetka, Illinois, half the time is given to the Dalton Plan and half to the old plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Walden Plan makes geography the basis of everything. Babies are admitted as soon as able to walk. First they learn to go about the school, and locate their room with reference to the rest of the premises. Later they venture out into the streets and locate the schools, and subsequently the parks, markets, docks, bridges, public buildings, factories, etc. The paintings of the children of the Walden Plan schools are famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reading is taught more rapidly than formerly by the use of cut-out pictures which must be fitted into certain places, designated by names. By the new method the child learns one hundred ninety words in the time usually spent in learning one hundred twenty-five. A. standardized stenography is hoped for sometime, that can be used in writing and printing, to take the place of the cumbersome letters and crazily spelled words' now in use.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE automobile is changing the country school, some say for the better, some for the worse. Now two or more districts combine in one larger graded school, conveniently located ; and the pupils are conveyed to and from the school at public expense. Since back in the seventies, Massachusetts has found it cheaper to carry the children from isolated districts to the larger centers in order to give them educational advantages. In some normal schools special courses are given, preparing superintendents to manage fleets of motor buses for the transportation of children to and from these consolidated schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The consolidation schools allow the children to remain at home until their education is finished, and are apparently doing away with the little red schoolhouse where one poor little woman tried to impart education to forty or more boys and girls of all ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The consolidation of schools is causing the construction of elaborate buildings in places where they would not ordinarily be looked for, and incidentally is providing the community with much-needed auditoriums for lectures, pictures, meetings and entertainments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A school that does not need to be consolidated with any other to give it enough pupils is Public School No. 109, of East New York, where an average of 5,189 little children holds the record for daily attendance. This school is equipped with a garden, savings bank, hospital, dentist’s office, printing office, carpenter shop, millinery shop, and sewing room.</span></p>

In the Radcliffe Woman’s College there are four hundred five subjects. In some of the men’s colleges the number of subjects runs far greater. There is a college for blind girls twenty miles out of London. The State of Washington has a college for fishermen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cornell University has a course for women where, in a model apartment, sickly infants are graduated normal children. The first agricultural college in America (at Lansing, Michigan) was founded only about sixty-five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scranton has a correspondence college which has upwards of two million students in all parts of the world, studying almost every known branch of science and art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Candler Floating School, financed by A'. G. Candler, Jr., of Atlanta, Ga., is an old army transport, fitted out as a university, which carries its students about the world, instructing them as they </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> reports that degrees of all kinds and grades can be had at costs ranging from $100 to $200. But there never can be any effective way to stop that practice; for it is well known that many of the men that have never been through college are more capable than those that have. Why try to stop a man from using titles which he is better fitted to wear than are those who gained them in the usual way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two or three years ago the progressive papers*had considerable to say about workers’ schools or labor colleges, where workers could be taught those historical and scientific truths necessary to qualify them to be labor leaders. The movement is not dead, but has not created the stir expected. In 1922 it was estimated that there -were 200,000 workers in the classes, in twenty-six schools throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the 200,000 schools in the country, about 6,000 are equipped to show motion pictures, which Edison is said to believe will constitute the chiefest means of instruction some time. Anything can be taught by movie that can be taught by the printed page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are ninety-seven colleges or universities imparting instruction Uy radio. One of the chiefest radio stations for imparting instruction is Watchtower WBBR, Staten Island, N. Y. Experience of radiocasters has shown that a twenty-minute lecture is about the right length.

But the educators hate to give up their idols. They try to tell us that a man can plow better if he has studied Greek; that Latin affords excellent mental training, and is the key to art, science, and the languages of France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Rumania.

<p><span class="font5">The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, 'Akron, Ohio, maintains such a school, so large in extent that a corps of seventy-five janitors is needed to heat it and keep it in order. One of the courses is instruction in the mute language, the Goodyear Company employing more deaf mutes than any other known concern. For this they deserve great credit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">FEW weeks ago the Editor lectured in a school auditorium. On the wall was a large map put out by Armour and Company, showing pictorially the states from which the Armour products come. It was a good advertisement for the Armour products. But it was more; it was a conveyance to the mind of the child that big business and the United States are virtually one and the same thing. There are plenty of grown folks that have that idea, and more are getting it all the time. What to do about it is quite another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font5"> boldly declares that Wall Street has supplied the funds for so editing and preparing certain textbooks as to make them teach that big business and Americanization are one and the same thing, and that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">proper interpretation of the United States Constitution means that nothing must ever be done to molest them in their hauls. Plenty of grown folks have that idea, too; and again they are at a loss to know what to do about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When it comes to the colleges and universities, aside from the state institutions they are the magnificent gifts of multimillionaires; and even when owned by the state are not free from the influence of the men who own the banks, department stores and factories, and who serve as trustees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upton Sinclair calls attention to the fact that President Hibben of Princeton was educated at the University of Berlin, as were also Presidents Lowell of Harvard, Butler of Columbia, and Angell of Yale, and suggests that American educators are doing for big business what the educators of Germany did for the Kaiser— shaping everything to suit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A year ago the country, or at least that part of it willing to use its brains, was stirred deeply by the action of the wealthy trustees of Amherst College in forcing the resignation of Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, for no other reason, apparently, than that Dr. Meiklejohn was teaching the young men to think for themselves. No one questioned his ability, his integrity or his equipment as a teacher or as a college executive ; but he often expressed openly the thought that “we are tired of the world that gives good things to the few. We are determined that everybody should have a chance at excellence, whether it be political or spiritual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a result it was common talk in Wall Street three years before he was forced out that he was a doomed man, because the financial interests had determined that they must get rid of him. As a protest over the rule of money at Amherst, ten of the faculty resigned and thirteen graduates refused to receive their degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an address at Bryn Mawr just before being forced out, Dr. Meiklejohn declared that America has not even the beginning of an educational system, but that “if we fail in the tremendous task of popular education, we shall fall back, with the rest of the world, from democracy to the rule of the strong few, whether these few be financial exploiters, political grafters, or dictators of the proletariat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It does not take the bright minds of the young long to see through anything that is not as it should be. Hence' it is with not a little amusement that we learn that the students of two of the Standard Oil Universities, Chicago and Syracuse, have been caught buying and selling compositions. If education is to be bought and sold in a large way, why not in a small one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. William C. Bagley, professor of education at Columbia, discussing a meeting of educators, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The nation’s educators joined in admitting that our public schools do not teach the basic facts about our industrial, economic and political life. Those who control the textbooks and the schools will not permit it. Soon the only way to get the facts to jhe child will be through bootleg channels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there were any way to separate them from politics, the schools should be all under one head, so as to raise the common level of citizenship, and make the country as a whole a better place in which to live. But we see no way in which this can be done until the Lord himself brings it about.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A teacher in the Bronx conceived the idea of having her pupils see some of the work that is done on the other side of the globe.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Ernest C. Wareing, editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Western</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Advocate,</span><span class="font5"> attending the quadrennial session of the Federal Council of Churches at Atlanta, Ga., makes the statement, as reported in the press that there are “five mental hysterias which have swept the nation and upset religious sanctity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These five are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(1) The Ku Klux Klan; (2) a wave of spiritism; (3) clash between Fundamentalists and Modernists; (4) a belief that the second coming of Christ is imminent; (5) an antiwar complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Wareing is an able man but he falls down hard on the fourth proposition. He takes it for granted that to believe in the second advent of Christ is a calamity. Perhaps he is not familiar with the New Testament; for therein it is placed as the second most important doctrine, second only to the atonement. Indeed, without the second coming of the King there would be no resurrection, no kingdom, no reward for the saints, no hope for the world.—1 Thessalonians 4:1418; 2 Timothy 4:1; Matthew 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Dr. Wareing, that great and matchless logician Paul was a little “hysterical” when he wrote about the second advent. And the same authority would imply that Jesus himself was somewhat beside himself when He gave us that wonderful chapter in the book of Matthew dealing entirely with prophetic statements concerning His own second presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It really is too bad that the good Dr. was not present graciously to instruct our Lord to be careful not to talk so much on the manner and signs of the second advent; otherwise he might “upset religious sanctity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Religious sanctity” evidently means the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">dark-age</span><span class="font5"> reverence for the superstitions of the Federal Council of Churches. Dr. Wareing hates to see religious superstitions fall before the light of divine truth because religious pride and power fall with them. But ecclesiasticism is falhng, falling forever, never to return!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Great forces are at work in the world, strong, right and heavenly, seen and unseen, that will soon free the people from darkness, error, ignorance and so-called orthodox “religious sanctity”. Then Dr. Wareing will be looking for a more honorable job.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>A Boon to the Housewives </span><span class="font5">By </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">w. o. Olsen</span></h5>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">[Mr. Olsen Is well known to The Golden Age. He Is in everyway reliable and dependable.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5"> AM writing to you, outlining an invention in the way of refrigeration, which should prove a blessing to the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This refrigerator is nothing short of a miracle. It will keep the provision chamber at a temperature of 45° (which is perfect refrigeration and much lower than the average of any ice-box), for a period of fifteen or twenty years, with an annual cost not to exceed seventy-five cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principle of this ref rigerator is explained in this manner: The provision chamber has a water-jacket surrounding it on three sides and on top. This water-jacket has placed inside of it at construction a certain chemical, which chemical becomes like a piece of rock candy in appearance, is non-poisonous, has no odor, and has none of the common objections to artificial refrigeration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When this refrigerator is delivered to a home, this water-jacket is filled with common cold water. Immediately the chemical begins to act on the Water; and within two hours’ time the provision chamber will attain a temperature of 45°, irrespective of outside surrounding temperature, whether it be sub-zero weather, or the trying heat of the tropics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The action of the chemical on the water, it is explained, takes from the water some of the heat units therein, and carries them off through openings or air exits provided in the exterior case. It also deteriorates the water to the extent of removing other natural qualities therefrom, in producing the desired refrigeration temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore as the chemical deteriorates the water, it must be drained off, and renewed in excessive heat or extremely hot weather about once in three or four weeks’ time. In cold weather like that experienced in our middlewest states, etc., about once in three months during the cold months is sufficient. When this water is drained off, the chemical does not drain with it, a rocky substance having been formed. This substance is good for from fifteen to twenty years, and is apparently non-deteriorating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The only cost of operation is the cost of securing water, which at the meter rate of this city would cost about thirty-five cents a year to operate. The water-jacket in which the chemical works is as lasting as the chemical itself, as the water and the chemical do not act according to the commonly accepted laws of rust and corrosion but in the reverse order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When this box has become known to the public to be as satisfactory as a lifetime of experimenting and perfecting has proved it to be, it will become the greatest blessing to the country home, the housewife in a modern flat building and all people living in places where the securing of ice is either impossible, unsatisfactory or costly;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is no other ice-box that will keep an unvarying temperature for twelve months of the year at 45°; for the average ice-box, while it will drop considerably at icing will in a few hours rise to 50°, 55°, and 60°, etc., until a new chunk of ice is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cost of this box is no more than any other good ice-box; and unlike ammonia plants and other artificial refrigeration,' there are no electrical costs, no moving parts, no costly chemicals, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The circulation of this box absolutely prevents the contamination of food odors common in all other boxes, such as butter, milk, strong meats, and odoriferous vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Armadillo </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a.</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Bohnet</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">N The Golden Age No. 136, page 148,1 notice a brief reference to the armadillo as a native animal of South America, that when attacked rolls itself into a ball within its armor plate shell which is almost impenetrable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Readers of The Golden Age may be interested to know that this strange little animal is found in large number in northern Mexico and in southwestern Texas and may desire further knowledge concerning it. Hence this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The armadillo is in size and weight about that of a ground hog (woodchuck), with a long tapering tail, shell covered, and an elongated, slim tapered head, likewise protected. It is very tame. One can walk right up to it cautiously and touch it, while at twilight it feeds on grass roots and mast that falls from the forest tree. To take it up, one must grasp it very firmly by its tail, close up to its body, and jerk it quickly to full arm’s length, and hold it suspended there head downwards a moment while it struggles desperately to free itself. When after a minute or two of jerky, hard struggling it finds itself unharmed and still a captive, it gives up altogether and instantly, opossum like, becomes tame and so docile that one can do almost anything with it. But let him bring it near the trouser leg during its struggle, and he will find his pant leg in ribbons almost instantly by the sharp claws of this little creature. Or let him lay it on the ground and turn away his face for a half minute, and he will find on turning about again that his pet has buried itself in th,e sand; for it certainly can make the soil, sand and gravel fly in burrowing a hole in the earth in which to hide itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These animals can be caught only after sundown. They do not venture forth during the daytime. They are hunted usually with dogs whose teeth have been filed down so that they can not bite through the shell armor and spoil </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font5">for commercial purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The female produces her young invariably in quartette. There are never more nor less than four in the litter. If one of the young ones is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a. </span><span class="font5">male, they are all males; and if one is a female they are all females. There never is a mixture of male and female offspring. In this respect the armadillo truly is a curious animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mexicans hunt the armadillo at night, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">catch usually from five to ten per night and sell them for sixty-five cents each to makers of armadillo baskets. That is, they remove the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">animal </span><span class="font5">from its shell and sell the shell to the manufacturer, who does the polishing and varnishing and trimming of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First the .shell must be thoroughly scraped and cleaned and then shaped into basket form; and the tail attached to the long slender head with a fine wire winding. When dried, the outer part of the shell is machine polished and varnished. Holes are drilled around the edge, and the basket lined with silk in a fluffy manner and decorated with ribbon. It is now ready for market, and the purchase price is from five to seven dollars each usually. These baskets are used for sewing materials, plant hanging baskets and for ornamental purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a concern in a Texas town that makes these baskets. The writer saw in that institution upwards of 5,000 of these shells in every grade of development. There were many of the baby and half-grown shells as well as the fully matured, and of varied shapes. These were being shipped to all parts of the world in crates of from six to twelve. The maker of the baskets had two dozen Mexicans in his employ who did nothing but hunt the armadillo and shape the shell into basket form. He has been in the business over twenty-five years in that place, and the animal crop does not seem to diminish. These animals are very prolific and do no harm. They live in the woods and brushlands in the hill district, where crops are not raised. One riding along in the light of the moon can see them quietly feeding along the roadside. One must not frighten them; for then they gallop away in a funny humpy jump that makes an onlooker laugh so heartily that he could not chase them. They seem to jump in four directions all at the same time. One would think that there are at least two of them hastening from him. We speak from experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shell of the armadillo is in flexible belts across the back and sides of the body, from head to tail inclusive. The little animal can roll itself into an almost perfectly round ball to resist attack by some carnivorous animals such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">the fox or coyote; but either of these could easily kill it</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>The Employment Situation</span></h5>

<h5><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>“The Switzerland of America” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. L. Bolling</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE writer spent Labor Day at Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, the scene of John Brown’s “Insurrection” in 1859, and aften called by tourists “the Switzerland of America”. The town is located at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potamic rivers, in Jefferson County, fifty-five miles northwest from the National Capital. Here the Shenandoah Valley branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad connects with the main line. The population is approximately 2,000, including Bolivar Heights, which was an important strategic point during the Civil War, the place being hotly contested by both sides during the battle of Antietam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Harper’s Ferry is the gateway to the beautiful and historic Shenandoah Valley. It is enclosed on all sides by surpassingly beautiful scenery and high mountains, which taken in connection with its cool breezes, pleasant walks and drives leading into three states, make it very attractive as a summer resort. On the north one may see Maryland Heights, and the Loudoun Heights on the southeast. The altitude of the former is 1,300 feet above the surrounding country, and 2,000 feet above sea level. The latter are not so high, but possess an impressive primeval appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Between these magnificently lofty heights the gently flowing waters of the Shenandoah unite and mingle with waters of the famous Potomac. The scene produced here by the meeting of the two rivers is so grand that when Thomas Jefferson. “the Sage of Monticello,” viewed it for the first time from the famous rock which bears his name, he declared that the panorama spread out before him was worth a trip across the Atlantic. It was from the rock just mentioned that Jefferson once delivered an oration to people assembled in the valley below. He surely had a wonderful voice to make himself heard so&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">far; but we believe that his voice carried farther when he wrote the Declaration of Independence I Doubtless, Divine Providence prepared Jefferson for the execution of this great masterpiece proclaiming the equality of all men before the law, and “the right for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Harper’s Ferry was named in honor of Robert Harper, a native of England. He originally resided in Philadelphia before coming to “the Hole” in 1747, as the place was then called. At that time the place was occupied by Peter Stevens, a squatter, who built a cabin there in 1734. Harper bought his claim, and later bought the land from Lord Fairfax, who was really the legal owner of the property. Harper died in 1782 and was interred there. In 1761 the Virginia House of Burgesses constructed a ferry across the Potomac and named it “HarpeFs Ferry”. During Washington’s administration, in 1794, the location was chosen for a national armory because of its natural advantages. Nature has assuredly endowed the place from the standpoint of military strategy, as well as from a scenic viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When this country expected war with France in 1799 troops were encamped on the beautiful heights now known as “Camp Hill”. The view of the surrounding country from this point is awe-inspiring and elevating. Here one may get a truly wonderful glimpse of the grandeur of God’s natural creation, and approximate that feeling of ecstasy and delight which will be the heritage of a restored race at the close of the-Golden Age.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>John Brown’s Rebellion Premature</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font5">N THE evening of October 16, 1859, John</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brown, a school teacher who lived in the immediate vicinity, a Kansan and an abolitionist, with eighteen ardent followers took possession of the armory, and imprisoned the guard along with several of the leading citizens of the place. When gray dawn arrived the next morning, the little mountain town was in a state of fear and terror; and all who went outside the door of their own home imperiled their lives. Many prominent citizens were slain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The news of the event was hurriedly taken to Washington and Richmond. State troops were rushed to the scene of the miniature rebellion, along with U. S. marines under the command of Col. Robert E. Lee, who was later known as General Robert E. Lee, who led the Confederate forces during the Civil War. (General Lee is one of my ancestors.) They demanded that Brown and his men immediately surrender; but ’ firm in the belief that he was an instrument in the hands of Divine Providence to free the <sub>; </sub>slaves, he refused to comply with this demand. Forthwith a fierce attack was launched against the engine-house (later called John Brown’s Fort, and still to be seen here), where Brown had strongly fortified himself. Of course, it was only a question of time until he was compelled to surrender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inspiration for Brown’s act is found in a famous book, entitled “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”, which was pieced together by a school teacher in New England, from newspaper stories affecting to portray correctly the condition of the slaves, but exaggerating the facts. The author “filled in” the gaps with gross misrepresentations, drawn wholly from her vivid imagination. The book, of course, caused a sensation everywhere it was circulated, and did much to bring on the Civil War. Brown thought that if the slaves were subjected to such cruelties, it was only necessary for a bold and fearless leader to appear, and they would immediately rally to his standard. Under this erroneous impression he swooped down upon the unsuspecting inhabitants. But the Negroes did not respond; hence his tragic denouement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was particularly interested in Brown’s exploit and subsequent fate, and went by auto to the old court house several miles out on the Winchester Pike where Brown was tried and sentenced to “hang by a rope until dead”. It is a somber old building. I entered and sat in the chair occupied by the judge when he pronounced the fateful sentence. Brown was indicted for treason, of course, and also for murder. From here we motored to the scene of his execution, now marked by the stump of a tree in the backyard of a dwelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may consider Brown largely excusable for the course he took in this matter. Doubtless he sincerely believed that it was God’s will for him to do what he did; and acting upon this assumption, he gave his life for the cause which later triumphed under the leadership of Lincoln, whom God had already chosen, probably before his birth, to break the shackles of slavery and to save the Union. We thus see in Brown’s act an act of presumption, which resulted disastrously to him and his followers. All can draw a profitable lesson from this which teaches us that we should not act rashly, upon false premises, but make sure in advance that the undertaking has the Lord’s approval and that He has chosen us for the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Brown’s supposition had been correct (i. e., that he was chosen by Jehovah to free the slaves), and if his method of initiating the movement had been in harmony with the Lord’s will in the matter, then the movement would have grown and gained force and momentum in some manner, however unfavorable the outlook at first, and would have been successful. But God is a God of order; He it was who founded this republic in the beginning; and it was, therefore, unreasonable to suppose that He would favor any other movement to accomplish the liberation of the slaves than one originating within and having the approval of the government itself. So we see that it is not enough to be sincere and conscientious: We must have the mind of Jehovah, or act in harmony with His plan. At one time Lincoln thought he would ‘'drop out of sight”, and so wrote a friend; but God had a work for him to perform, the accomplishment of which a million Douglases could not have prevented.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Sheridan to the Rescue</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font5">HILE en route to the scene of Brown’s execution, the writer stopped at the old house on the Winchester Pike where General Philip H. Sheridan was lodging on the night when he was aroused from slumber by the roar of cannon twenty miles away at Winchester, and made his desperate ride to the Battle of Winchester, known in history as “Sheridan’s Ride”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arriving on the great battlefield, Sheridan found the Union forces in wild disorder, utterly routed by the Confederates, and on the run. The first person Sheridan met was Major William McKinley, later elected President of the United States, who quickly informed the General concerning the real status of the battle. Within a short time, with masterly military skill Sheridan rallied his forces and turned the tide of battle in favor of the Union Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here again we may note the overruling hand of Providence: Had Sheridan started on his trip a few hours later, and lodged forty miles away from Winchester instead of twenty miles, he would never have heard the roar of cannon, but would have slept on in blissful ignorance of what was transpiring. The Union forces would have suffered a smashing, shattering defeat, equaled only by that at the first battle of Bull Run; the whole character of the war would have been changed, and perhaps the Union cause lost. Truly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“There is a Divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them as we will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many noteworthy military events took place at Harper’s Ferry during the Civil War. It was held by Lieutenant Jones at the outbreak of the war; but when the Virginia militia appeared he left, setting fire to the armory before leaving. The Confederates took possession and held it until General Johnston abandoned it with the intention of preventing General Patterson crossing the Potomac river at Williamsport. Of course, the place was immediately occupied by Federal troops. The town was later held by , General Dixon S. Miles, when Lee invaded Maryland in September, 1862. At this juncture of the war, General Stonewall Jackson suddenly appeared with fourteen brigades and surrounded the place. General Miles was enclosed on all sides by the Confederate troops, who advanced until they were within one hundred and fifty yards of the Union troops on, Bolivar Heights. Miles then ordered a white flag run up, but was fatally wounded by a shell from a battery before the men in control of same had seen the flag of truce. About 12,000 surrendered and were paroled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Bolivar Heights one may behold in all their grandeur the famous Blue Ridge Mountains, which were the inspiration for the popular song, “In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peace reigns in Harper’s Ferry now; and we hope for its residents an increasing peace which will know no end in the Golden Age. Then instead of profiteering on tourists for a living four months out of the year, they will engage in some more praiseworthy line of endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Harper’s Ferry can claim another distinction which is overlooked in the guide book descriptions of the place; namely, an exact double of Judge J. F. Rutherford in the person of a Mr. Dittmeyer, proprietor of Dittmeyer’s Pharmacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The resemblance is startling; and while Mr. Dittmeyer is a little smaller in stature, they would easily pass for twins anywhere. If this man should appear on a public platform, it is safe to say that many would have great difficulty in detecting the difference.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Eruptions in Christian Science</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">T SEEMS that some of the Christian Science brethren have been getting on their dignity and telling what they think of one another; and that their boasted knowledge of how to overcome all evil does not hold good with the heads of the organization itself. First on the list is the Christian Science Board of Directors, clamoring for the scalp of the Christian Science Publishing Company and attesting,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“From January hl, 1919, to December 1, 1921, the actual paid circulation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Science Sentinel</span><span class="font3"> decreased more than seventy percent (70 %); the actual paid circulation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Science Journal</span><span class="font3"> decreased more than seventy-five percent (75 %); and the actual paid circulation of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Science Monitor</span><span class="font3"> decreased more than eighty percent (80 %). The net earnings of said Society have fallen more than half a million dollars a year to less than nothing; and the business of said trust is continuing to fail, showing a loss in recent months of nearly a thousand dollars a day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it seems that Mr. Eustace and the other gentlemen who were engaged in piloting the publishing end of the business did not want so much glory to come their way all at once. So they proceeded in an affidavit before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts to reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It is difficult to treat seriously your charge that the losses of circulation in the periodicals of the Publishing Society are due to mismanagement by the Trustees. You know in your consciences that these losses have occurred in spite of our best efforts, and in consequence solely of the things you yourselves have done or approved. You know in your hearts, as every Christian Scientist knows full well, that the injury to our leader's splendid publications, which you mention in your letter, lies at your door; that it has been caused by the insidious propaganda which you have wholly inspired and approved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And then along comes Mr. John V. Dittemore, who used to be one of the Directors of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, of Boston; and he tells of many things that make interesting reading. We let him say what he has to say in his ®wn language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The following facts will be of interest to the field. They are taken from the auditor’s report on the financial affairs of the Benevolent Association for the year just closed (1921) and from information furnished by the Secretary of the Association:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Cost of Benevolent Association buildings and improvements of January 1, 1922, $1,028,414.88. Included in this amount is an item designated as ‘grounds’, $85,601.34. This is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font3"> a record of the cost of the land, but merely the sum of money spent on the grounds. The valuable land upon which the Benevolent Association buildings stand was a gift of a member of The Mother Church who resigned as a Trustee of the Benevolent Association in 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The capacity of the Benevolent Association buildings is about 150 ‘guests’. The average number of ‘guests’ during the year 1921 was 80. On January 1, 1922, there were 71 ‘guests’, of whom 3 were non-paying and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font3">had been given some concessions on their expenses. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">average during the year was 4 non-paying and 17 partpaying ‘guests’. The advertising campaign now being conducted may increase the patronage and justify </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">large expenditures for an additional building and other improvements, but one can not but doubt whether this </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">a dependable method for building a permanent success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The expense of operating the institution for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1921 </span><span class="font3">was $303,958.24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The income from operating the institution for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1921 </span><span class="font3">was $221,506.51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The loss from operating the institution for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1921 was </span><span class="font3">$82,451.73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This loss was absorbed by the gifts and contributions which have been solicited from individuals and churches in the field and which amounted in 1921 to $224,695.02.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The average income of the Benevolent Association from all sources during 1921 was $1,252.00 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The average </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cost of caring for each patient</span><span class="font3"> in </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1921 </span><span class="font3">was $3,800, or about $10.40 per patient per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The average amount paid by each ‘guest’ per day was about $8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“It is indeed fortunate that this institution has what has been described as an ‘unlimited reservoir of money’ in the field from which to draw.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Dittemore thinks he knows what is the matter with the Christian Science organization, and goes on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Sectarian bitterness, pride of authority, superstitious personal idolatry, and the direct and indirect fear </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">loss of means of livelihood, are among the leading and predisposing beliefs and fears which are causing the paralysis so evident today in every department of the Christian Science church organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The ‘official circle’ of Christian Science activity in Boston constitutes a little world of its own. Around the Directors flock a host of major and minor officials, petty office-holders, office-seekers, sycophants basking in the smiles of official approval, social ‘climbers’, hired and volunteer ‘mental workers’, stock salesmen, and all the et cetera of the court of a petty principality wherein personal adulation, flattery, intrigue, politics, and self-mesmerism predominate. There are wives who for the first time have tasted the intoxicating experience of social preferment. There are unsophisticated visitor*<sup>-</sup> iTom distant fields who are fascinated and awed by t’-.d official atmosphere, and flattered by the studied efforts of officials and their representatives to make each one believe he is an especially favored friend whose visit to Boston has been a long-looked-for event. Thus </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">state of mind is soon developed in which official hints of whatever course of action it is desired to have followed upon the return home of these visitors, are readily accepted and proudly followed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What such a course of action might be is indicated by Mr. Dittemore in the following form of a questionnaire, which apparently all Christian Scientists were compelled to fill out and sign in at least one congregation. It would be hard to match it for a piece of cold-blooded tyranny:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘ELEVENTH CHURCH OF CHRIST,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">SCIENTIST, OF CHICAGO “Logan Boulevard and Mozart Street ' Chicago, February 1, 1923</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Dear Friend:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“This questionnaire is to be returned to the Board of Directors of Eleventh Church of Christ, Scientist, of Chicago, within five (5) days from date of mailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“1. What was your attitude toward the literature published by the Trustees? (This question refers to the former Trustees whose action involved the Mother Church in litigation.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“2. When did you discontinue taking the literature?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“3. Do you recognize the Board of Directors of the Mother Church as the governing body of the Christian Science movement, and having control over all its activities ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“4. Do you stand unreservedly for the enactment and enforcement of the decisions of the Board of Directors of the Mother Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“5. Do you consider any member of this church disloyal who does not stand unreservedly for the action of the Board of Directors of The Mother Church ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“(Questions 3,4 and 5 are to be answered by either yes or no.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sign______</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Any member of this Church who does not answer the above questionnaire satisfactorily, or does not answer it at all, will be so reported to the Board of Directors of The Mother Church. , _ &nbsp;&nbsp;. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Board of Directors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the foregoing, which speaks for itself, we are advised by an ex-Christian Scientist that members were warned not to read any accounts derogatory to their Board, and that when the presiding Judge Dodge ruled against them they made an unsuccessful effort to have him disbarred. We have ourselves come in contact with the Censorship Bureau of the Christian Science Church, which impudently assumes to intimidate publishers of independent publications against mentioning anything at all reflecting unfavorably upon the Christian Science movement. We are advised also that they maintain a censorship of libraries somewhat like that exercised by the Jesuits, aiming to prevent the reading of literature which they do not approve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since writing the foregoing we have seen a 20-page booklet by Mr. George Lincoln Putnam, C. S., of San Francisco, in which he presents some more food for thought. Mr. Putnam objects because the Directors have made certain changes in the way of running things; and it is self-evident that he and every other Christian Science member have ample grounds for complaint. Mr. Putnam says in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Manual, Article 1, Section 9, provides that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">salary of a Director shall be $2,500 per annum. Article </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">XXV, </span><span class="font3">Section 3, forbids any change in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">by</span><span class="font3">laws. All previous changes in these salaries had only been made with Mrs. Eddy’s approval, and were from time to time openly recorded in the Manual. Yet, according to the evidence brought out in the case of Eustace vs. Dickey, the Directors secretly raised their own salaries to $10,000 each per year, and then, on the basis of this new salary, they secretly voted themselves a pension for life—after only ten years of service. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font3">beneficiaries were kept in ignorance of this misuse </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the Church funds until it was exposed during the litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Shawmut Real Estate Trust was disclosed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">the members learned that this trust, composed of the Directors of The Mother Church, holds property valued at over one million dollars, belonging in fact to the Church; that a vast yearly income is derived therefrom—but no accounting has ever been made thereof to the members of the annual meeting, or otherwise.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 273 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">S</span><span class="font5">ALVATION means saved from eternal death with an opportunity for everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every sane person desires to live. If this were not true doctors, druggists, and hospitals would not be employed in an attempt to prolong life. If there is a way for the salvation of man, surely all would want to know about it. We should be anxious to tell each other about it without money and without price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When speaking of two salvations I do not mean that a man will have two opportunities for salvation; but I do mean that salvation is provided for mankind on two different planes, and that an opportunity to accept one of these must come to each person in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All those of the world who call themselves Christians are divided’into two different classes, namely, Catholic and Protestant. Both Catholics and Protestants believe and teach that salvation is only for those who become members of the church, and that all others are lost. There are many more Mohammedans on the earth than Catholics and Protestants combined. There are many more Buddhists than Catholics and Protestants taken together. There are many Jews on earth. These three classes last mentioned have nothing in common with the Catholics and Protestants. Is there no opportunity of salvation for these three classes also?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Both Catholics and Protestants teach that the salvation that is obtained for those who join the church is eternity in heaven; that the eternal destiny of all the wicked is endless torment. There are many wicked people who claim to be Catholic, and many who claim to be Protestant. Not even many Catholics or Protestants have any real hope of going to heaven. I submit that this is a fair statement of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every honest man desires to treat Catholic, Protestant, Jews, Mohammedans, Buddhists, bond and free, in a fair and equitable way. If honest, he desires to see all these have some good things, regardless of their place of birth or nationality. It is a measure of love in the heart of man that prompts him to feel thus toward his fellow creature. The great Jehovah God is the complete expression of love. Is it not reasonable to think that He might have some plan of salvation by which all could have an opportunity for life ? If not, then poor imperfect man must have more love than has God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible answers this question. It reads: &quot;This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) Here is a plain statement that to know God means to know of His arrangement of salvation. Would it not be well for all people, whether they be Catholic, Protestant, Jew, or Mohammedan, to lay aside manmade theories of salvation and with open and unprejudiced minds examine God’s Word? Let us now together do that very thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Bible we. read: &quot;For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.” (1 Timothy 2: 3, 4) The will of God is His Law or His Word, and whatsoever God wills must come to pass in His own due time. Concerning this the prophet Isaiah says: “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”—Isaiah 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God changes not, as He states in Malachi 3: 6. His Word is unchangeable. (Hebrews 6:18) Here, then, is the expressed statement that it is the will of God that all men shall be saved. That must include Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Mohammedans, Buddhists, and all otherheathen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">UT what is meant by all men being saved?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer is, Saved from death. The</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Scriptures say: “In Adam all die.” (1 Corinthians 15:22) The perfect man in Eden had a right to live on the earth forever, if he continued loyal to his Creator; and when he was sentenced to death for disobedience of God’s law and when that judgment was in course of execution, he began to produce his children. The result was that all of his children were born sinners. (Romans 5:12) This means that they were born imperfect and unrighteous, and therefore in due course must die. God promised that He would provide redemption from death, stating through His prophet thus: &quot;I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death.”—Hosea 13:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s law provided that a perfect life must be given for a perfect life. Who, then, in all</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the earth could provide an exact ransom or corresponding price for the perfect man Adam? The Scriptures answer: “None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him.” (Psalm 49: 7) Thus we see the absolutely hopeless condition of the human race. But in due course Jehovah sent His beloved Son, Jesus, into the earth that the people might have life and have it more abundantly. (John 10:10) And again we read: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘We</span><span class="font5"> see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”—Heb. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">value</span><span class="font5"> of the perfect human life that Jesus laid down at Calvary He took up again when He rose from the dead. That is what we call the ransom price; namely, His right to live as a perfect human being. God had now resurrected Jesus to the divine nature; and He no more needed the right to human Hfe for His personal use, but that valuable thing He presented in heaven as a sin-offering on behalf of mankind, using it first for the salvation of His Church. (Hebrews 9:24) It was the Lord Jesus who brought life and immortality to life for the first time, through His death and resurrection.—2 Timothy 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This opened the way to salvation, and this message of salvation first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed by them that heard him.—Hebrews 2: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four thousand years had elapsed from the time of expulsion of Adam from Eden when Jesus brought to light life and immortality, and opened the way for man to be saved. During that period, great numbers had died and gone into the grave. They are still dead. Concerning them God’s Word says: “There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.”—Ecclesiastes 9:10.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>The Church First</span></h6>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">E IT noted that 1 Timothy 2: 3, 4 points out that it is the will of God that all men should be saved, and then brought to a knowledge of the truth. That means that salvation must be first provided, and then each one in his turn brought to a knowledge of this fact giving him an opportunity to accept or reject it. The Apostle continues: “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”—1 Tim. 2: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now have in mind that Jehovah long before had said to Abraham: “In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12: 3) It is plainly stated in Galatians 3:8 that this good news was preached aforetime to Abraham. In this same chapter we read: “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as if many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. . . . For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”—Gal. 3:16, 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is manifest, then, that the seed of promise is The Christ; that Christ means the anointed class; that Christ Jesus was the first-fruits of all those that died and were resurrected, and that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Christ</span><span class="font5"> must first be developed and then be used by Jehovah as a means for taking the message of truth and salvation to all their other families of the earth. The first or chief salvation then is for The Christ. A synonymous term for Christ is the Church. Nowhere in the Bible do we read about the Catholic, the Protestant, the Methodist, the Baptist or the Episcopalian church. Nowhere in the Bible do we read that by putting names on earthly church books this prepares one for heaven. But we plainly do read concerning the “church of the firstborn” whose names are “written in heaven” (Hebrews 12:23), and that Christ Jesus is the Head of the Church (Colossians 1:18), and that His true and faithful followers constitute the other members of it. These are they who have the great salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus said: “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father.” (Matthew 7: 21) Not every one who claims to be a Christian is going to heaven, but only those who </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">do the will</span><span class="font5"> of God and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">do it faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amongst other things that the Lord commands His followers to do is to tell others about the glad tidings of the kingdom. (Matthew 24: 14) These are to tell it, not for filthy lucre, but as the Scriptures put it, to “feed the dock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensam-ples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.”—1 Peter 5: 2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To do this faithfully will entail suffering upon each and every one, as we read: “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.” (1 Peter 4:12,13) How many who belong to the various church denominations really suffer because they earnestly and zealously tell others about the Lord’s great, kingdom? May I ask candidly: In how many churches in Greater New York is the gospel of Christ’s kingdom preached ? Do we not read in the daily papers that in many of these churches the heathen religion of the peoples of East India, Sun Worshipers, is observed; and that even an exhibition of North American Indian dances are held in the name of Christ?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Promises to the Church</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font5">ARK some of the promises given to the Church: “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.” —2 Peter 1: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How much knowledge could a. congregation gain of the glory and virtue of the Lord by listening to some heathen sing or by watching an Indian dance? Then in the same scripture the Christian is admonished that he must be diligent in adding to his faith virtue, fortitude, knowledge, self-control, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and love; and that if he fails to do these things, he is blind to his privileges. Then adds the scripture: “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.”—2 Peter 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus it is observed that it requires diligence upon the part of the Christian to have a guarantee that he shall go to heaven. To such Jesua said: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.” “And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations.” “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”—Revelation 2:10,26; 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic and the Protestant clergy have taught the people that by joining their church they could be saved and go to heaven. There are millions who claim to be Catholic, and other millions who claim to be Protestant. Yet Jesus plainly said only a little flock shall be in heaven. (Luke 12: 32) There are many more people in the city of New York than will ever be in heaven.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Knowledge Essential to Salvation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">rpHE Scripture plainly states that the only J- means of gaining heaven is through Christ Jesus. “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Act<sup>3 </sup>4:12) And again we read that life is a gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans '6: 23) “Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.”— Romans 5:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is absolutely impossible for any person to accept a gift without having knowledge of it. This is exactly in harmony with the scriptures above quoted, that all men must.be brought to a knowledge of the truth. God will not enforce eternal life on any one, but His purpose is to give everyone an opportunity to accept everlasting life on His terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Acts 15:14-17 we read that God will first take out from the nations a people for His name, and that then He will set up His kingdom in the earth that the residue of men might seek the Lord. The “people for his name” first taken out is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Christ</span><span class="font5"> class, the true Church, the seed of Abraham according to the promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When those who compose this favored class have finished their course, then will be the due time for all the other peoples to receive a knowledge of the truth and have an opportunity to obey the Lord and receive the free gift of life.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Restoration Their Hope</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">OR many centuries the people have looked for the second coming of the Lord, because He promised to return and set up His kingdom. The whole creation has groaned and travailed for this, not knowing for what they hoped; but they have really hoped for relief. So state the Scriptures in Romans 8:19. The purpose of the second coming of the Lord and the establishment of His kingdom is that restoration blessings can be offered to the entire human race. Restoration means to restore that which was lost. Adam did not lose a home in heaven. He never had one to lose. No man has ever lost such. Man is an earthly creature. Heaven is provided as a great reward for the faithful Christians who, after making a sacrifice, faithfully obey the Lord until death. Restoration means the restoring to man the things that Adam lost for himself and all his progeny, to wit: the right and privilege to live on the earth forever as perfect human beings. Concerning this we read in Acts 3:19-21: “Times of refreshing shall come from the presence [face] of the Lord; and he [God] shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other prophets, from Moses to John the Baptist, foretold the coming of these days. Concerning this we read in the Scriptures: “Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel, and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.”—Acts 3: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hope of salvation for the world aside from the Church, then, is earthly, not heavenly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the 4000 years before Jesus came to earth many good men had died, but not one of these went to heaven. Concerning David we read in the Scriptures, that he was a man after God’s own heart. (Acts 13:22; 1 Samuel 13:14) The name David means beloved. He was loyal to the Lord. Many years after his death, the Bible says this of him: “David . . . is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. . . . For David is not ascended into the heavens.”—Acts 2: 29,34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have beem told by many ecclesiastical teachers that Abel, Abraham, Isaac, and the prophets died and went to heaven; whereas Jesus plainly says: “No man hath ascended up to heaven.” (John 3:13) Here is the plain statement that they had not reached heaven when Jesus left there, yet they had been dead more than a thousand years. In fact, none of these prophets will ever have the divine nature. John the Baptist was the greatest of all of them; and concerning him Jesus said: “Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”—Matthew 11:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 11th chapter of Hebrews names a long list of these faithful men, from Abel to the last of the prophets, and then says of them that they all died and must wait until the Church is complete. Then they will be resurrected and made princes in the earth. The Lord plainly stated that many shall come from the east and west and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom. This will not be in heaven, but on earth.—Matt. 8:11; Psa. 45:16; Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scripture states that the second coming of the Lord is for the purpose of giving a trial to the living and then to the dead. (2 Timothy 4:1) “God hath appointed a day” for this purpose. (Acts 17: 31) The first thing will be to give them a knowledge of the truth in order to give them an opportunity to accept the free gift of life through Christ. The message which God sent to the earth through the angel at the birth of Jesus was this: “Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.” (Luke 2:10) In due time this good news must come to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The promise concerning that kingdom is this: That the Lord of hosts will make unto the people a feast of fat things and will destroy the vail of ignorance that covers the people and the nations. (Isaiah 25:6,7) There is a great time of trouble now on the earth. It will increase with intensity for a short period of time, and then the Lord will make the truth so clear that all the people can hear and understand.—Zephaniah 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great ransom sacrifice applied on behalf of the world will remove the legal disabilities. The eyes of the understanding of the people will be opened. Every one will be brought to a knowledge of the truth, and every one will then be given an opportunity to learn and obey God’s rule of action that will lead to life.—Isaiah 65: 17-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today there are many millions of Mohamme-Hans, more millions of Buddhists, and millions of other peoples of earth who are in absolute ignorance of God’s wonderful plan. These must be brought to a knowledge of the truth. The time in which this opportunity will be given them is called the day of the Millennial reign of Christ. (Acts 17:31; Revelation 20:6; 5:10) Concerning that blessed time the Prophet says: &quot;And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.”—Isaiah 29:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that it is not so now is because Satan, the terrible one, and his earthly agencies, whom he uses to teach false doctrines, have blinded the minds of the people. But with the kingdom in operation the Prophet says: “For the terrible one [the devil] is brought to nought and the scorner [those who scorn God’s Word and His plan] is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity [injustice to oppress mankind] are cut off: that make a man an offender for a word [that persecute </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> for speaking the truth], and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just [right thing] for a thing of nought.”—Isaiah 29: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this righteous reign of Christ falsehood will be torn from the position of power, and truth enthroned forever which shall guide the people in the way that they should go, and bring to them the blessings God has intended for them from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking of the two salvations, the Scriptures say: “There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [heavenly] is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.” “The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.”—1 Corinthians 15:40,47, 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus we see that a few will be saved to heavenly glory and have association with the Lord; but that the wicked will be cut ofif and perish forever; that those who accept the free gift from the Lord and are obedient to Him shall be restored to a perfect condition of humanity and dwell upon the earth forever in peace, in happiness, with endless life.—Psalm </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">37: 29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD” </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">( <sup>IUD</sup>^'^OT<sup>H</sup>BO&lt;mF<sup>D 3</sup> ) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">rjrn With Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford’s new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">fl | | </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’’’When Jesus was taken up into heaven, the angels standing by the disciples said to them: Ue shall come in like manner? The manner of His going or being taken away was quiet, without observation, except by a few. In a similar manner we should expect His return. Those watching for His coming necessarily would be the first to observe His presence. This is in exact harmony with the thought expressed by the apostle Paul when he wrote: “For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.” (1 Thessalonians 5:2) The same thought the apostle Peter expressed: “The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night.” (2 Peter 3:10) And of His coming Jesus said: “Behold, I come as a thief.” “If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.” (Revelation 16:15; 3:3; Matthew 24:43) A thief comes usually in the night time when all are asleep, and none see him except those who are watching or those who may be awakened by his presence. Even so the Lord comes in the night time of the close of the Gospel Age, just before the dawn of the new day; and none discern His presence except those who watch and who have the eye of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’“The Lord spoke in symbolic phrase, and speaking concerning the manner of His appearing He said: “Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.” (Matthew 24: 25, 26) Here He is warning and safeguarding against the error of believing that He will appear in the desert or that He will appear in some secret chamber; as spiritists claim they have come in contact with Him. Then He says: “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the presence of the Son of man be.” (Matthew 24:27) The word lightning here is translated from the Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">astrape,</span><span class="font5"> and means bright shining, or bright shiner. We know that lightning does not come out of the east and shine even unto the west; for flashes of lightning come from all directions, and more often from</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">the west than from the east. The bright shining or bright shiner here really means the sun. The sun begins to shed forth its light in the east before it is fully up; and when it comes over the eastern horizon it shines everywhere from the east to the west. Just so the presence of the Lord. He quietly appears and His presence begins to shed light in all parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’“The Prophet of the Lord also used the sun to illustrate the Lord Jesus, saying, “The Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings.” (Malachi 4:2) Again, Jesus likened His faithful followers unto the sun when he said: “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”—Matt. 13:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’“In examining the evidence, then, with reference to the Lord’s second appearing, if we will keep always in mind that His appearance is not and will not be visible to human eyes, but that it will be gradually discernible in the physical facts which will occur in fulfilment of prophecy, we shall be better enabled to understand the various Scriptural texts bearing upon the subject.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark107"></a>Strife in the Churches</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Torn by a controversial spirit and rent with disputation, the churches meet the problems of 1925 with the uncertainty that there is in mutiny in the ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Repeated failure of the plans of.the world leaders has bred an uneasiness that looks for some word of the end to whieh affairs relentlessly move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Word that holds the assurance of intervention by a power beyond man’s, an assurance that would hold forth the essence for hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But are leaders of spiritual thought, one faction disbelieving—the other untenable—are such capable of inspiring man with hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible meets the present crisis with that stellar force so peculiar to forces not bound, not limited, but characteristic of control that is better to be talked over and contemplated than to be tersely analyzed within the bounds of exact prediction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible’s solution of the present-day problems evolves a plan for man’s happiness, a plan that begets confidence; because the world’s present trouble is identified by the fulfilled prophecies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Habp Bible Study Course uses as its basis the prophecies of the Bible, assembling the writings in the order of their bearing upon the history of the world, and assembling the teachings under ten basic doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Harp Bible Study Course seeks to identify those prophecies that interpret today’s events, that would lend assurance in what seems to be so impenetrable. The course outlines reading periods of an hour each week, completing the course in twelve weeks’ time. Self-quiz cards point out the principal things to watch for as you read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a reference library for examination of particular texts, the seven volumes of Studies in the Scriptures complete a library of over 4,000 pages, bound in maroon cloth gold stamped. All texts are indexed, and the subjects are arranged topically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures and the Harp Bible Study Course complete $2.85. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
