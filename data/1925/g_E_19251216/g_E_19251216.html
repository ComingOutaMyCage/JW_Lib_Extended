Now the state department has ruled that a member of the British Parliament cannot come in, ostensibly because he believes in communism. Liberty disappeared from America while Wilson was king. If Mr. Saklatvala does not break any laws, why should the state department worry over what he believes? If all the people who believe foolish things were excluded from the United States, the country would be emptied of its inhabitants, beginning with the state department. If the British can stand it to let Mr. Saklatvala talk in parliament, why be fearful here?</span></p>

Plants are located where the food is grown, insuring dehydration while the material is in prime condition.</span></p>

To catch a flea-bearing rat cost $ 238, and each ordinary rat $72. This is, to say the least, a high price for rats. But that is what the people want—high taxes, so that they can pay high rents.</span></p>

Two fine piano wires enter the peach simultaneously. When they encounter the pit, they spread on each side, stripping the fruit of the meat, and allowing the stone to drop below.

In the spring they migrate into the fields, where they live, and thrive, raise families and do great damage. The Department of Agriculture is now showing the railroad companies how to poison these critters and thus make it advantageous all around. A diet of poisoned clover does the trick.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font4">VERY once in a while we hear of another non-stop Bible race, in which some church organization undertakes to read the Bible through, reading day and night, with relays of readers, until the book is finished. This is nonsense, not Bible study. The Bible is ths greatest book in the world and needs to be stud* led critically, carefully, comparing one text with another, noting even the differences in translations and the readings of the oldest manuscripts. It needs to be studied prayerfully, humbly and with Bible helps such as are now available to all truth-seekers.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">CCORDING to the Bishop of Chelmsford, the world is clattering back to barbarism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So says the Vancouver </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Saturday Tribune,</span><span class="font4"> and continues its editorial comment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">; True, the world has experienced a terrible jolt that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">, threw civilization off the rails. All the deviltries of the world were let loose ten years ago, and it is not easy</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sub>;</sub> to chain them up again. The world is outwardly ir-: religious because it has lived through a furnace of I savageries which was the negation of religion. It saw ' the churches in all lands silenced when the real test of ' whether they stood for spiritual things or temporal things came. They capitulated to the God of War just like any other </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">human institution, and they are shattered today by that surrender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ If the churches have lost the people, it is not because Christianity has failed, but because the churches failed in a great emergency to embody the teachings of Christianity. It is because they have attached to Christianity doctrines which the minds of men refuse to accept, and have neglected to rest upon that plain human gospel which Christ delivered and the world still needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let the bishop take courage. All is not lost. And the truth about today is not all told in the newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. But, one naturally rises to ask, if the cure is as simple as that, why is it not being applied! Possibly because the “plain human gospel which Christ delivered” has been completely lost sight of, and in any case it does not fit in with present business arrangements.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Making War Ladylike</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HE Toronto </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font4"> is pessimistic about peace talk, also somewhat cynical. Under the heading “Making War Ladylike” it editorially says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An extraordinary number of persons who would pass an ordinary test of intelligence scoff at the idea of outlawing war, but clamor for the outlawing of the use of poisonous gases and other methods of warfare which they regard as unladylike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely, it is clear that in a life-and-death struggle nations will stop at nothing. War cannot be made safe or decent or humane. The business of a nation at war is to destroy the man-power of the enemy. And modern science has provided ingenious weapons which show no mercy for women or children, but which, in their very nature, carry carnage to all classes and ages of both sexes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">World society is again placing the ban on the use of poisonous gases and of bacteria as weapons of offense. But the gun that fires blindly to a distance of seventy miles may still destroy non-combatants. Unseen aircraft may still drop tons of explosives on sleeping cities. Warships may still cut off the food supplies of a nation. High explosive shells weighing a ton may still blow orphans’ homes to pieces. Mines dug below unsuspecting troops may still hurl hundreds into eternity. Machine guns firing hundreds of bullets per minute may still shoot humans down like vermin. War glorifies the work of extermination. And the side getting the worst of it will pay no attention to the rules previously drawn up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">War is too costly in life, property and happiness to be retained when international disputes can be adjudicated .just as fairly as those between individuals. The banishment of war as between civilized nations has entered the stage of practical politics. The impractical persona are those who would retain war in the hope that they may make it decent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With, the recent practical and appallingly plain arguments against war (and four years of unbridled savagery surely is such an argument), it seems incredible that there should be any disinterested people who will applaud war in any form.</span></p>

He quotes from a speech of Air Chief Marshal Trenchard, of the British Air Force:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although it is necessary to have some defense in order to maintain the morale of our people, it is far more necessary to lower the morale of the enemy’s people, for nothing else can end war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The process of “lowering the enemy’s morale” is accurately dealt with:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We can now drop a greater weight of bombs in one day than was dropped during the whole of the recent war. Five hundred machines could drop more than three thousand tons of dichloroethyl sulphide on London, in a week, one drop of which will disable and a few drops burn to death. This substance is a liquid, which not only burns but evaporates into a gas which poisons on being inhaled. An area contaminated with it remains untenable for weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lewisite, an arsenic preparation, penetrates gas masks and causes excruciating pain, mental distress, madness and attempts at suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Phosphorus bombs, unquenchable with water, will be dropped on large sections of a city . . . and throughout the night the long orgy of horror will continue until the first faint streaks of dawn break upon a city, great tracts of which will be smouldering poisoned ruins while the streets are choked with the dying and the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This should have thoroughly subdued and demoralized any ordinary population; the ends (whatever they are) of war will have been served, and the world made safer (?) for democracy!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Canada’s Liquor Question</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">L</span><span class="font4">IQUOR and the liquor question continue to hold a share of the spotlight in Canada. Ontario has endeavored to please a section of its population with 4.4 alcoholic strength beer, much to the disgust of all prohibitionists and connoisseurs of good beer. As is usual with a compromise, no one is pleased. Quebec continues with its government dispensary system and continues to show healthy balance sheets as far as cash is concerned, and unhealthy ones on the moral situation in the province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">British Columbia has a government dispensary system and a license system “grafted” on to it with a result, as reported in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Northern Messenger,</span><span class="font4"> that “bootlegging was never so prevalent as it has been lately”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On January 2nd, 1925, the Vancouver </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Province</span><span class="font4"> tells of one of the periodic Vancouver drives:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Armed with ninety warrants, squads of the Provincial Liquor Board Police cooperating with the City Dry Squad, cost the city $27,271, but Attorney-General Manson, claiming that the law was not being adequately enforced, had the provincial police also working in the city and in December deducted $22,219 from Vancouver’s share of the liquor .profits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Prince George and Cranbrook the so-called profits were completely wiped out and in many other places materially reduced. Besides the amounts charged the municipalities the reports of the Liquor Control Board show that the cost of enforcing the Act is steadily increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the Vancouver </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Province</span><span class="font4"> unctuously reviews the situation and indulges in some platitudes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The force that will finish liquor is the. force that finished the dodo, the mastodon and the dinosaurus. These things flourished in a crude, half-made world. When the world improved, they could not keep up. They disappeared because they had lost their usefulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Men use alcohol today as an expedient. It creates for •them a world of illusion wherein all imperfections become perfections and all failures become glorious successes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As man’s power for success increases, as his personal liberty becomes greater, and as he gradually grows into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">more efficient being, his need for liquor wiU die away. The illusions of happiness and prosperity that alcohol brings him will become realities. His craving to fool himself will lessen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Liquor drinking has been on the decline </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for centuries </span><span class="font4">furies. For every dyed-in-the-wool drunk there is to day, there were fifty from six to ten generations ago It is no longer necessary for a gentleman to fall under the table every night. Sobriety has become the rule rather than the exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prohibition is one of the things that evolution is ate tending to. And in spite of laws and armed policemen, alcohol will disappear, but not one moment before man becomes good enough and sensible enough and efficient enough to do without it.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Looking Around for Saints</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HE Toronto </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">-Mail and Empire</span><span class="font4"> comments on the proposed saints for the Church of England :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the Church of Some is scanning the record of a number of Englishmen and Englishwomen to determine whether they are proper subjects for canonization, the Church of England is also discussing a proposal to create a few saints. The matter is now in the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the list approved by him will have to be approved also by the House of Commons before it can become the law of the church and the law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of those who have been suggested as proper saints are Charles I, Henry VI, Archbishops Laud, Parker and Cranmer, and Florence Nightingale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Henry VI did apply funds for Eton and King’s College, Cambridge, but he also involved his realm in a civil war. Perhaps one of his claims lies in the fact that lie was murdered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Charles was also interested in education, but to admit him now- as a saint would be to admit that the English rebellion was a mistake, and we doubt if the masses of churchmen would commit themselves thus far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Florence Nightingale was a Christian if ever there was one. She was also an Episcopalian; but if she is a subject for sainthood, then Lytton Strachey has written in vain. Anybody he writes about becomes disqualified, with the exception of Cardinal Newman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. P. W. Wilson, of the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times Magazine </span><span class="font4">suggests that in view of the close ties between the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States and the Church of England it might be a gracious act to include an American saint or two, and nominates George Washington, who was a staunch Anglican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the great ones of history are disqualified because they were not Anglicans. John Bunyan, who has g window in Westminister Abbey, was a Baptist. Wesley and Wycliff are among the great figures in the history of English religion, but they did not conform to the Anglican system of worship, though it has been argued that they were not dissenters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No doubt, after the choir of saints is established, an amendment to the Prayer Book will be made so that they can be supplicated, adored and asked intercession of. The cleavage between Rome and the Anglican communion is rapidly being healed.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Wanted—Medical Common Sense</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">THE Vancouver </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Tribune</span><span class="font4"> brings to light some further facts in the war against vaccination being waged in that city. The following report is worth consideration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Medical science has run riot over vaccines and inoculations in the last few years. Simple laws of sanitation are being neglected. During the recent fake smallpox epidemic in Vancouver—an epidemic which was cured almost instantly by a ban on the American tourist trade—one doctor who favored pus injections told his audiences that sanitation had nothing to do with the preventing of smallpox. He could see nothing good but pus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such teaching is quite contrary to many high authorities, but the result of it is seen in an illustration at Langley Prairie, where three alleged cases of smallpox were recently reported, and a demand made that all the scholars be subjected to an injection of the pus of bovine syphilis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the parents organized a committee of inspection, the committee including a trained sanitarian. This is what they found:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the boys’ lavatory the urinal was in a filthy condition, with the Hushing apparatus apparently out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Moisture surrounding three toilets, which showed signs of having had no swabbing for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On flushing toilets there was a very offensive smell of sewer gas from each, which would indicate that the septic tank is not in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Returning some time afterwards it was found that there was no water in the tanks to flush toilets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With four windows for ventilation, all were closed except one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the girls’ lavatory a quantity of rubbish in the doorway; a hole cut in brass plug in clean out trap allowing gas to escape, considerable moisture surrounding all toilets, showing signs of no recent swabbing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On flushing four toilets, two overflowed their contents over the floor. Two emitted sewer gas on being flushed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“On returning later no water in tanks to flush toilets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Four windows for ventilation—ALL CLOSED.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We do not like to poke fun. at medical science, especially in view of the decision in a lawsuit this week which exonerates a hospital and the medical staff in a case where a patient’s operation wound became maggot-infested and his death ensued. But surely medical science has outrun common sense when medical health officers permit all the windows of a school to be closed, to have toilets plugged up, septic tank out of order, and emanations of sewer gas, and then think that these invitations to disease can be corrected by merely inoculating all the children with cowpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Perhaps if there were not such huge profits in vaccines and serums the public would not have them forced so upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The medical hierarchy, so long as it can do its work and force its will on the people without adverse publicity, has a fair chance of success, ■Daylight, and complete reports of the other side of the question, will do much to force the vaccinationists into the open. It has yet to' be successfully demonstrated that a circulatory system filled with cowpox pus is as. good a road to health as an alimentary system emptied of improper ■food, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">HE </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Herald Newspapers,</span><span class="font4"> of Moose Jaw, Sask., has an editorial aimed at salacious and unmoral literature; “Profitable Filth,” it is termed. ‘ It reprints in part a Winnipeg </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font4"> editorial which takes a well-merited wallop, at the.feature of American publications ©f a type which, no wholesome-minded American will support</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1912 the total raise of magazines coming into Canada was $81,000. In 1922 the value had increased to '$3,123,000. What represents this increase? Chiefly periodicals filled with stories of sexual perversity and erime, which are attaining a most astonishing circulation in Canada. The Dominion is contributing-.very substantially to building tip a large industry,: and not in our own country but-in- the the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publication in the United States of a particularly offensive and particularly dangerous type of literature is becoming, as a matter of fact, an industry of tremendous proportions; growing by such leaps and bounds that it now rivals the moving picture business. One publisher alone, starting with a single magazine a few years ago, now publishes in the neighborhood of thirty, each one a little more unwholesome than the last, and all of them filled with cheap nastiness, the most offensive feature being a simulated morality eloaking their real satare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just because the United States permits and supports this profitable beastliness is no reason why Canada should. It is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of Canadian law that these publications should be permitted to come into the country and be sold here. Nevertheless they come, in the number of at least a million S month, and are read chiefly by the young of both sexes. “The most consistent reader of so-called ‘confessional’ magazines is the girl of high school age,” said a social service report issued in Toronto recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It would be difficult, indeed, for a mature mind, saturated in this form of literary garbage for a month, to retain a sane and wholesome outlook on life. Their effect on adolescent minds can he judged in that light. There can be no possible blame attached to a young girl who regularly devours these magazines if her mind, her every thought, is tinged with sex. The blame rests with the parents who permit such things to find a place in her life, and with the public and the public officials who permit them to be offered for sale in almost every newsstand. It is in this, as in so many other things of our times, a careless public—permitting unscrupulous men to pander for profit to the natural curiosity of youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the public is not backward in criticizing the tendencies of youth. Over and over again the comment may be heard that the young people of today seem to have no moral standards. It might very well be said that they are not permitted to have, that on every hand they are besieged by influences that tend to undermine character; and these are the product, not of youth, but of an older generation seeking profits from the exploitation of youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The obscene magazine mill, pouring its filth into this country at tremendous profit, is only one example of these influences. It is outstanding, however, for that reason that it illustrates the careless public attitude. Machinery exists that could bar every one of these magazines out of the country, and would, if an outraged public demanded it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many readers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine would do well to overhaul their own children’s literature supply and determine just why the light in the bedroom of the ’teen-age girl burns till all hours of the night, and what type of “movie” and “artist” literature she devours when not in the immediate spotlight of the family. The same censorship of the growing boy’s mind* food might do no harm. Good healthy tiredness acquired on the baseball lot or tennis court, is more desirable than enervated minds and relaxed morals, as a result of pernicious reading matter.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark140"></a>The Visions of Mary Martha Chambon</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font4">E HAVE before us a 64-page book published. by the Academy of the Visitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font4">contains imprimatures of the Archibishop of Chambery, Cardinals Gasparri and Maffi, and the Archbishop of St. Louis. Cardinal Gasparri’s letter states that the pope was delighted with the book, and wished the story published as widely as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Francoise Chambon, as she was at first called, had visions when she was nine years of age. They were accompanied by the clairaudient ear. After two years in a convent she spent a term of eight months lying on the floor of her cell, wearing rough haircloth, night and day. A crown of thorns was added, not permitting the head to rest without severe pain. The eighth month expired in May, 1867. During this experience the book says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the “Silence of the night our Lord revealed Himself to His servant in the most wonderful manner. Doubtless. He sometimes left her to struggle painfully during long hours against fatigue and sleep, but more frequently He took possession of her immediately and she lapsed into an ecstatic condition. He confided to her His loving secrets, overwhelmed her with caresses and plunged her heart into His own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The mother superior of the convent was made the custodian of the messages which came thereafter to Mlle. Chambon. They fill many pages, having for their object the cultivation of reverence for—not the death of Jesus, which pays man’s ransom, but—His wounds. One of the messages was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When My holy Wounds were made, vain men believed that these Wounds were at an end; but they will be eternal and they will be seen eternally by all My creatures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">; The book indicates that Mlle. Chambon not ; only had visions of and conversations with <sup>:</sup> Jesus, but with God Himself, and with the Vir-i gin Mary. We quote from pages 39 and 40:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Sunday in Lent the sister’s suffering state not</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">: permitting her to assist at the sermon, her Beloved came to her and said: “I am going to give you an occupa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• tion: offer your sufferings in union with My divine sufferings, for the souls in purgatory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sister began to make this offering, and at each repetition she saw a soul ascend to heaven. She was at the twentieth, when the Eternal Father said to her: *<sup>f</sup>I give you My Son’s power, provided you offer your heart united to His.” She endeavored to do so and at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">each act of offering and union—according to her expression</span><span class="font4">pression—she saw a flight of souls ascend to heaven “like a flight of birds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Souls delivered by her sometimes came to express their gratitude, saying: “May the feast that saved us—the feast of holy Wounds—never pass. Before coming to the enjoyment of God, we did not know the efficacy of this devotion. In offering the holy Wounds of our Lord to His Father a second Redemption is procured.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among these souls some are particularly near the heart of a religieuse—the souls of her own sisters. Sister Mary Martha prayed and suffered for them very specially, the Blessed Virgin expressed her satisfaction: “The souls of your sisters in purgatory are my daughters, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font4">take great pleasure in hearing you pray for their deliverance. ... I suffer much to see them in this fire. . . . Nearly all of them go there. ... I am Queen and I wish those souls to reign with me. In spite of all our power, my Son and I cannot deliver them; they must expiate. But you can so easily relieve them and open heaven to them in offering the holy Wounds for their souls to God the Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the following interesting paragraphs from page 46 we have the key to the source of all these visions. Bible students will see at a glance that Mlle. Chambon was a spirit medium, deceived and being deceived. Moreover, we have here undeniable evidence that from the pope down the whole structure of Roman Catholicism is permeated with demonism. The scripture is surely fulfilled which declares that “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird”. (Revelation 18:2) The story of Mlle. Chambon continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before such a proof the sister submitted loyally, and to repair her past opposition did her utmost to propagate the devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Devotion to My holy Wounds is the remedy for these iniquitous times,” assured the Savior. “I Myself will it —and your aspirations must be made with great fervor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This progress enraged the demon, who vented his wrath upon our sister, whom he began to deride: “What are you doing here? You are losing your time. Others say beautiful prayers from the books, but you are always repeating the same thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But Jesus drove the demon away : “My daughter, I see all, I count all. Tell your Mother that I keep account of each of her aspirations; she must do all in her power to maintain the Chaplet of Mercy; I am happy to see you honor My holy Wounds. I can now dispense more plentifully the fruits of My redemption, and you who know My will must be doubly fervent. . . . You will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">lose much if you relax in devotion to My Wounds."</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a fine time these two demons had, persecuting, oppressing and deceiving this poor woman, one of them even pretending to be the Lord Jesus, as previous ones had pretended to be the Virgin Mary and even God Himself. How joyfully we look for the day of the Lord when all these malific powers will be destroyed, never more to delude and enslave mankind I</span></p>

On the Captain’s private receiving set we heard, through the loud speaker, both music and address quite distinctly, though at the time we were 500 miles to seaward. We are both of the opinion that the music was excellent and approbate, while Judge Rutherford’s address certainly excited a depth of thought that comes too seldom to the average of us.

<h4><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Regarding' Net Earnings of Soft Coal Miners</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By James L. Meurer, U. M. W. of A. International Headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">R</span><span class="font4">EFERRING to a recent item in </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> regarding the wages, of soft coal miners, I find this article very misleading. You say: “When he works, if he is a union miner his wages average about one dollar and sixtyseven and one-half cents per ton.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now this does represent the approximate cost of production, but not the wages of the miner that produced that one ton. In producing one ton of coal it requires several operations, and the one dollar and sixty-seven and one-half cents represents the pay of more than one man; for instance the wages of loader, driver, motormen, track men, eagers, dumpers and flat trimmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The initial price per ton to the pick miner is one dollar and eight cents per ton, out of which he has to pay for his powder, for the sharpening of tools and the wear and tear of the same. This runs expenses close to twenty- or twenty-five cents per ton, which would leave him about eighty-five cents per ton.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark154"></a>The San Francisco Idea Spreading</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HE San Francisco idea (or did it originate in Los Angeles'?) that all the employers in the town agree among themselves not to have anything to do with labor organizations, seems to be spreading; although union labor is still too strong in points north of Louisville and east of Minneapolis for the open shop idea to flourish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The towns that seem to be now definitely tied up by these associations of employers, some of which have one name and some another, are: Atlanta, Jacksonville, Louisville, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Joplin, Topeka, Kansas City, Sioux Falls, Billings, Butte, Helena, Great Falls, Ponca, Oklahoma City, Sherman, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, Denver, Colorado Springs, Salt Lake City, Tucson, Phoenix, Spokane, Tacoma, Portland, Stockton, Richmond, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Fresno, Bakersfield, Los Angeles, San Diego.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Seattle, for example, the Associated Industries, annual membership fee $20.00, asks the question: “Do you think that it has been mere accident that there have been practically no labor difficulties in the city of Seattle for the past four years?” And then it answers the question by saying, “The Associated Industries has gone about its work quietly, without noise or publicity, but has endeavored to meet and cope with trouble before it fairly started, rather than wait until it was a real, live menace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How this was done is indicated on the same circular when footnotes add that “the American Trades Association, with nearly 4,000 members, will supply skilled workmen in any trade, unskilled labor and office help”; also, “the members of the Associated Industries obtain important advantages for their employes, executives and office staffs through the Group Life and Group Total Disability Insurance offered under the Associated Industries Group Insurance Plan.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark156"></a>The Prerogatives of the T</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font4">HEN the Creator placed man, the public, the people, the government, on His footstool, He endowed them with industry, brain and brawn, energy and raw material in superabundance. In fact, everything essential to all human enterprises, the only real capital man has ever known, was his—more than adequate to meet every social demand and develop every child of man physically, mentally and morally to the limit of its natural equipment. Man then invests units of industry in units of raw material, transforming them into commodities, real property, the only things that pay or satisfy human needs, the base of life and the mainspring of all human endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the sacred duty of the public, the people, the government, to employ its members and natural resources for the common good, with Justice to all and special favors to none, to recognize and apply that law of nature or statute of man which declares that man shall give an equivalent in social service for any and all benefits or property acquired; that he “shall not get something for nothing”, shall not appropriate or confiscate the earnings or property of others without due consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">; The public equips, develops, operates and </span><span class="font10">whole People </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By H.E. Branch </span><span class="font4">maintains all public enterprises with public industry and resources at public expense. It is the only party investing and is therefore entitled to all proceeds. The only things necessary to enterprise are industry and public resources. Therefore the so-called capitalist has essentially nothing to contribute or invest. Industry, service, property, is the only thing that satisfies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a railway can give a certificate or ticket defining the units of service received and its equivalent in other service to be bestowed in exchange; if a court can give a witness an order to the public defining units of social service rendered and good at its face demands for an equivalent in other service in exchange, then it follows that the public, people or government can do likewise and issue orders to society or any of its members, defining units of industry or service demanded, and good for its equivalent in other service in exchange for it. Its possession is evidence that its possessor has rendered social service denominated and is entitled to its equivalent in exchange for it. Such a fiscal system would develop our country and its resources without debt and without embarrassment, and it would stabilize social affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JSS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The captains of industry” who confiscate from public enterprises about $20,000,000,000 annually in service, interest, profits and dividends on their own </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bogus debts,</span><span class="font4"> on promises to pay without even intending payment, while giving nothing in exchange, are naturally “conservative”^ They do not believe in any change, are satisfied with their enormous graft, and have bribed officials and a puppet press to disseminate false propaganda in support of their claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is about time to inject a little practical common sense into social affairs, drive the thieves and money changers out of Nature’s temple and restore land and natural resources to the public, their natural and proper owner.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark158"></a>Types of Brazilian Armadillos </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Mrs. B. Ferguson</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">N </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> for February 11, Mr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bohnet gave a fine description of the little, grey armadillo of Mexico. The description suits the same little animal as we know it in Brazil, except that in this part of South America we have a much larger species of a different color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The large armadillo of Brazil is red and is found principally in the high lands, above the coast range of mountains, while his small brother is mostly a habitat of the low land; though sometimes he is found in higher grounds, too. The Brazilians call them tatu (pronounced tatoo, “a” as in “ah”). To distinguish the large one his name is tatu-vermelho.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The armor plate of the large species is similar to that of the small one, except that the dividing sections are not so close together, and the whole is covered with a thin, loose skin from which grows long, scattering hair, giving the beast a fuzzy, dirty look—the color of the red dirt found in Brazil. This red armadillo is not pretty by any means, but rather repulsive. His legs are extremely short; his whole appearance is as if he had been flattened out, his shell almost touching the ground. Nor is he ever a pet; he is not considered harmless, as the little black kind has the name of being. On the contrary he is a pest to the farmer who lives where the tatu-vermelho abounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He loves sweet potatoes, and begins his operations even before the tubers have begun to grow, thus destroying more than if he had patience to wait for the larger roots. For this reason he is not a favorite animal in Brazil, and many are the means used to destroy him and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First, a well-trained dog is used; but he has to know his business, for though the tatu is easily caught he is not so easily held. If he gets a good start into the ground with his long sharp daws, the dog and his master will have some fun digging him out. A strong man cannot budge him, even with a strong tail hold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, some dig a square pit, which must be well lined with strong timber, both bottom and sides; the top also must be strongly covered, except the small opening in the center through which the tatu is induced to enter by a bait, the smell of which leads him to fall into the trap to his sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Others resort to poison. Strychnine is put into a bad egg and sealed up, then placed in the potato patch; and as there is nothing a tatu loves so well as a rotten egg he soon meets his doom. To poison one is to get a number of the murauders; for they never hesitate to feed on the carcass of the dead brother. In this way the farmer may save his potatoes for his own use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They will also destroy pineapples, always selecting the nicest and ripest They are so numerous in some places that the woods look as if a troop of hogs dwelt there—the ground being so rooted up, and their trails running in every direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These pests rob hens’ nests on the. ground, and also eat small chickens; and worse still, they will burrow into newly made graves and feast on the dead unless the grave is extremely deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I myself have seen graves so demolished. The whole of this description is from personal knowledge, through experience and observation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The flesh of the small species of tatu is considered clean and is counted as a delicacy, especially when an old black “mamma” roasts it in its shell above the coals, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bien tostado </span><span class="font4">(well seasoned), as only a Brazilian Negro cook knows how, with her wonderful assortment of condiments and rich garden spices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the red armadillo is not edible. On the contrary it has a very offensive smell; and even its shell is of little use, being so ugly. However, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">boy may cook its flesh for his dog and throw the shell into the yard for a chicken trough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A giant armadillo is found on the Amazon, a beast some two feet high and three feet long. He also is red; but is sleek and clean looking. He stands well up on his legs and is so very large that a person instinctively takes the second look to believe his own eyes. A splendid stuffed specimen is on display in the Ypiranza Museum here in Sao Paulo, a building erected to commemorate the spot where the independence of Brazil was proclaimed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Independência on morte)—</span><span class="font4">a museum of no small interest which no one should miss when visiting the great city of Sao Paulo, Brazil</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark160"></a>The Golden Rule in the Clothing Business</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font4">E HAVE been asked to make some mention of the operation of the golden rule as worked out in the clothing business by Arthur Nash of Cincinnati. Mr. Nash claims that the operation of this rule has eliminated all labor troubles during the most trying industrial period of the world's history, has ushered in love, contentment, cooperation and happiness, and has banished their opposites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1918 Mr. Nash had his garments made up by contractors and did a business of $132,190.20. Five years later the annual business was $5,958,508.67. Last year it was $9,245,429.70 and this year will probably be in the neighborhood of $15,000,000. The plan is to make one dollar net profit on each suit and to divide.the profits with the employes, or among them The concern now has 6,000 employes and distributing depots in forty-three large cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At first the profits of the business were divided twice a year on the basis of the salaries earned, but when the workers got back in the shop and talked the matter over on the basis of the golden rule they presented a petition that the profits should be divided equally among all workers on the basis of time worked instead of on the basis of wages drawn. As a result some old ladies and beginners received at the end of the first six months $91.80 in a lump sum, which was more money than some of them had ever handled at one time before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When hard times hit the clothing business the workers in the cutting room presented a plan whereby, by a rearrangement of the tables and assorting of the orders, they could accomplish more work; and they requested that their piece-work rates be reduced one-third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the matter did not end there. The employes got together, and realizing that throughout the clothing industry most shops were working only on quarter time they presented a petition that the Nash Company give work to all clothing workers in Cincinnati, and that if in carrying out this resolution it should be found necessary to cut wages, they requested that the first cuts be made so as to affect only those making over $5 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The adjustment of a golden rule price has been difficult. On the one hand it seems like </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">commendable thing to give customers the benefit of the very best ready-made clothing at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">price of $23.50 per suit when other concerns charge very much more for suits of the same quality, but on the other hand the interests of competitors must be consulted. Some of these competitors have even written to the Nash Company and begged them to raise the price three or four dollars a suit so that they would not be driven out of business but would have a chance to live.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">N JL dispassionate </span><span class="font4">little pamphlet bearing the title, “Oil and the Germs of War,” Mr. Scott Nearing presents facts that make the thoughtful sad. We summarize a few points:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The relative power of the Standard Oil Company and the Supreme Court of the United States was illustrated in the ten years following the decree of the court declaring the Oil Company a trust in restraint of trade and ordering its dissolution. In that interim the cash and stock dividends paid by the dissolved companies had a market value of eighteen times the capital value of the property when the dissolution took place, and the market value of the stock of the dissolved companies was thirty-five times the capital value at the time of dissolution.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>Oil in the Great War</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">U</span><span class="font4">NDER this subheading Mr. Nearing says in part: . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The four new and decisively important transport factors developed during the late war were the submarine, the airplane, the tank and the motor transport service. The country which had only cc-al could use ne one of these devices, but was confined to the steam engine and the horse on land, and the ooal-burning ship at sea. The oil-rich nation could make war in the air; could transport its armies in motor cars, which are much more mobile than steam engines; could fight with land battleships and, because of the less weight ef oil fuel, could mount heavier naval guns than its coal-using rival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Germans had coal in abundance, but little oil. German armies moved in trains or walked. The Allies had an abundance of oil. Their armies were more mobile; their air fleets were better supplied with fuel; their submarines had an abundance of motive power, and their battle fleets were being rapidly transformed into the oil-burning basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was not until the Standard Oil Company threw its great resources to the support of France, at a time when French oil resources were exhausted, that the victory of the Allies was insured. Mr. Nearing says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lord Curzon, at a dinner to the Inter-Allied Petroleum Council (Nov. 21, 1918) put the matter thus: &quot;The Allies floated to victory on a wave of oil.” The multitude ascribed the triumph to the soldiers. The more experienced statesmen, who were on the inside of the national councils, understood that the triumph of the Allies was the triumph of superior air-fleets, naval units and of superior army mobility due to the use of motor cars. The men in the trenches fought equally well on both sides, as anyone who was at the front over A long period of time is ready to admit.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ISA</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The World War was thus an oil-won war, proving conclusively that the national supremacy of the future rested on oil as a source of military and naval power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is an interesting story that Mr. Nearing tells of how the oil-poor British Empire in the ten years from 1910 to 1920, acting under the cover of various corporation names, gained such exclusive or dominating interests in every important oil field of the world that at the end of that time British public men came out in the open declaring that by 1930 Americans would be under the necessity of importing five hundred millions of barrels of oil annually and paying for it a billion dollars, most, if not all of which, would find its way into British pockets.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>The First Oil War</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">T I</span><span class="font4">NDER this heading Mr. Nearing presents the justifiable opinion that in its last analysis the war between Greece and Turkey- was actually </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">war between Britain and America. Britain was known to be backing lie ShellRoyal Dutch Oil Company in its efforts to monopolize the oil reserves of-Mesopotamia, and was using Greece as its catspaw; the Standard Oil Company, which owns the twelve leading newspapers of France and largely operates the French government, worked in;ou Turkey, through France, to accomplish the same end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have said that Mr. Nearing’s pamphlet is dispassionate, but perhaps we should make an exception of the following paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What a picture this Near East scramble presents! What a sight for the gods! Greek farmer boys and artisans lay aside their tools, and, in the name of Jesus, don uniforms and sail away to fight against the heathen Turk, while Turk farmer boys and artisans lay aside their tools and arm themselves to destroy the tm believers. On either side the soldiers pass in bold array. Publie men harangue and flatter them, priests exhort them, newspapers extol them, crowds applaud them. They reach the front; camp in over-crowded, disease-ridden, ■waterless places; march through the baking heat, ragged, half-starved; they ravish the country-side, trampling crops, sacking farms, destroying olive groves, burning villages; they meet in battle, sweat, bleed, suffer, agonize, die. For them it is a war to vindicate a faith, and to save their hearth-stones from dishonor. But behind them, in London, Paris and New York, sit old cynical, scheming men, laying the plans for the next, campaign, and wondering whether the result of a given battle will be an extra dividend for Shell Transport or for Standard Oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before there can be a successful war, or even a threat </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">war, people must be whipped into a frenzy. They must forget the work they have been doing, the families they have been raising, the friends they have been making, and prepare to destroy the property and lives </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">their “enemies”.. Who are these enemies ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They are the citizens of some other state—ordinary human beings—mechanics, fathers of families, neighbors. But if this simple fact were understood there could be no war, because no man in his right senses would tear them to pieces with bombs or burn their houses er destroy their factories and railroads. Consequently, the editors, the teachers, the preachers, the public speakers, the photographers and the advertising men are set to work to paint the “enemy” as beasts and monsters. This is done regularly as a prelude to every war; and since there are bad deeds to the credit of every people, it requires only a little ingenuity and a touch of imagination to make Greeks believe that all Turks are children of the devil, and to make Turks believe that all Greeks are limbs of the tree of eviL The tin th tellers are silenced, the proper government department acts as official liar for the administration, the sense of pity is num tied, love and brotherhood are cast aside and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">nation seethe with fear and hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why are these preparations made? Because without them there could be no war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Must there be war? Yes, there must be war so long as men are bent on taking their livelihood from others instead of producing it for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Strictly speaking, war Is organized destruction. Then* is nothing impetuous, emotional, or accidental about a war as there is about a street fight. On the contrary, it is just as carefully worked out as the most methodical business in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Modern states spend more money on war than on any other single government activity. Since the purpose of war is destruction, modern states devote their chief energies to wiping out the wealth and the life that have been accumulating through the centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. Nearing believes, like ourselves, that the League of Nations is no solution to the problem. A league of bandits or of robbers would be a thing to be feared, not courted. On this point he says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many people believe that the League ef Nations wfli provide the answer, but to those who have studied </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">origin and development of the modern nation, the League of Nations seems as inadequate to meet the need as is an Indian canoe to transport iron ore from Duluth to Buffalo, sr a prairie schooner to haul fam machinery from Illinois to Dakota. the canoe and the prairie schooner both had their uses, and in their day they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font4">wonderful assets in the struggle of the human race </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">control of the continent, but they </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font4">been superseded </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4">the steamboat and the locomotive. So it is with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">modern nation.

<p><span class="font7">On the Road to Ruin</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TN A letter of Premier Stanley Baldwin, Sir A George Hunter, one of Britain’s leading shipbuilders, is quoted as expressing the following fears for British welfare:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our shipbuilding trade is becoming more and more depressed and a large proportion of our ships are laid up. Our iron and steel trades are largely idle and their men unemployed. Most British shipbuilding yards are closed, or being closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is evident something is wrong with our industries. What is wrong? Is it capitalism? Is it trade unionism? Surely a royal commission to inquire into and report upon the economic situation of our industries and the conditions affecting them is much more needed than another inquiry into coal mining made alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The need is urgent. We are not on the road to improvement. We appear to be on the road to ruin.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark172"></a>Man’s Duty to The God</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">[Radiocast from Watchtower WBBR on a wave length of 272.6 meters, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HOSE who accept the Bible as true believe that Jehovah is The God, The Most High over all, The Almighty, Author and Creator of all things good. In the exercise of His goodness He created and gave life to the first man, therefore He is the Father of man. Father means life-giver. He gave to the first man Adam the right and power to transmit life; that is to say, to beget his own species. God thereafter put into operation His law, to which all men are indebted for whatsoever measure of life they possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had the man whom God first created remained in harmony _ with the laws of the Creator he would have lived forever in happiness, and his offspring would have enjoyed the same rights and blessings as long as they were obedient to God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The exercise of divine justice, in the absence of divine love, would have destroyed man without any hope of recovery. But the divine attributes always work in harmony. These attributes are wisdom, justice, love and power. The love of God began to be exercised immediately upon the pronouncement of the divine judgment against man. The exercise of the attribute love made provision for the redemption and deliverance of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The plan of God was made in wisdom and the end thereof was known unto Him from the beginning. As the plan of God began to unfold He caused men to write down certain events for the benefit of others who should come after them. This is why the Bible was written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first five books of the Bible were written by Moses, but without doubt Moses wrote many things he did not understand. These things were written for the benefit of people who are living in this present time. We know this because of what the Bible itself says, and because we see the fulfilment of prophecy now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other good men of ancient times likewise wrote that which they did not understand, but they wrote what God instructed them to write. If the Bible is merely the expression of the human mind then we could not surely rely upon it; but the inspired writer of the Lord has said: &quot;For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.”—2 Peter 1: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Amongst the men of ancient times who thus</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">isa</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">wrote was David, the son of Jesse, whom the Lord anointed to be king and who afterwards was king of Israel. It is recorded concerning him, in 2 Samuel 23:1, 2, as follows: “Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel said, The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The term “holy men” does not mean that these men were perfect in their words or their deeds, because their imperfections are recorded in the Scriptures. By the term “holy men” is meant consecrated men; that is to say, men who sincerely and honestly endeavored to do the will of God. Such men devoted themselves to the service of God and these God has used, and upon them He has caused His holy spirit to operate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The holy spirit of God is His invisible power operating upon the minds of such men as He desired to use according to His own purposes. When we speak of one writing down the word of God by inspiration we understand that the invisible power of Jehovah, operating upon the mind of such an one, caused him to make record according to the will and purposes of God. God would not exercise this power upon any one unless that one was anxious to do the will of God. The prophets of old were consecrated to God, therefore they sincerely desired to do His will; and God in love exercised His power upon the minds of such; the exercise of which is the operation of the holy spirit upon the mind of such an one. Therefore such holy men became the amanuenses in the hand of Jehovah to write down such things as Jehovah desired to have recorded. For this reason men can confidently and perfectly rely upon the Bible because it is God’s Word and not man’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David was one of the holy men of old mentioned in the Scriptures. Because David was guilty of some improper acts many men have rejected that part of the Bible which David wrote. They do not understand. No man is perfect. David did many things that were reprehensible. But he always acknowledged the wrong, did the best he could to rectify the wrong, prayed God to forgive him and then tried to reform his way. Above all he diligently sought to be faithful to God. He never denied God. He</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">always honored Jehovah and was loyal and faithful to Him; and for this reason it is written concerning David: “The Lord hath sought him a. man after his own heart.<sup>55</sup> (1 Samuel 13:14) “And when he had removed hirn [King Saul], be raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine heart, which shall fulfil all my will.”—Acts 13:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The name “David” means Beloved. His words spoken or written apply often to that class of men particularly loved by the Lord. Frequently they apply specifically to God’s beloved Son. To the extent therefore that every human being has a real and sincere desire to know what the great God would have him to do he may apply some of the words of David to himself. Amongst such applicable texts are the words spoken, by the prophet, in Psalm 116:12: “What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore every person who believes that Jehovah Ged is the great Most High, that He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. may with propriety ask himself the question that David here asked: “What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gratitude would prompt a man to ask such a question. Gratitude must precede love. Gratitude, moans a feeling of kindness awakened by reason of a favor received from another. It means a friendly feeling toward a benefactor with the desire to show proper appreciation of the benefactor's goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Suppose you were in great need as a result of misfortune; that yoa were sick unto’ death; that you had neither food nor raiment nor shelter and that the members of your family were likewise suffering; and then suppose there came a good man who found your in this, condition and gave., ' \i . «&lt;• &nbsp;&nbsp;' . ' to himself, sup</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">plied your needs, provided shelter, food and raiment and nursed you' back to health. You would feel grateful to that person. That feeling would be gratitude. Gratitude would prompt you to say to your benefactor,. &quot;What can I. do for you for all of this goodness you have bestowed upon me? Ascertaining what you might do for your benefactor to show your appreciation you would gladly do it if within your power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When man comes to an appreciation of what God has done for him then gratitude of necessity leads him to inquire: How may I show my ap-preeiation? Let us consider some of the things God has done for all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since all men are descendants of Adam they were, as the prophet in Psalm 51: 5 says, bora in sin and shapen in iniquity. As St. Paul puts it in Romans 5:12, by reason of Adam’s sin and by reason of inheritance, sickness and suffering resulted therefrom, the whole human race was undone, without any hope of recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Prophet Job, in chapter 33:19-22, gives an allegorical picture of the miserable condition of humankind: “He [man] is chastened also with paiii upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: so that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his' bones that were not seen, stick out. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to' the destroyers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No one can say that God was responsible for this suffering of man. The first man had wilfully violated the law of God, and justice could do nothing short of pronouncing the death sentence against him and putting him to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the operation of the natural laws of creation all of the offspring of the man Adam were born imperfect—hence the suffering of humankind. But the goodness of God 'has. made provision for man’s release from suffering and his complete deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Benefits</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we come to examine the facts concerning the benefits that God has bestowed upon men they are too numerous for us to recount them all. God would not have us forget them all. We do well to keep before our minds constantly at least some of these benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Prophet David, on another occasion, wrote: “Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who re-deemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s law, prompted by love, provided that the sentence against man, and its effect upon his offspring, might be satisfied by the voluntary death of another perfect man. This implies, of course, that another perfect man could be found. But none could be found in all the earth, because all were descendants of Adam. Concerning this it is written: &quot;There is none good, no not one. None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus we not only see the helpless condition of the human race but realize that nothing within the power of the human race could relieve it from suffering and death. Now God’s love came to the rescue. It is written: &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the 'world; but that the world through him might be saved.” —John 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to make this great gift for man God permitted His Son to leave the heavenly courts and to lay aside His heavenly glory and power, and to become a man in order that by His death He could meet the requirements of the law and thus provide a redemptive price for mankind. —Hebrews 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was God’s unspeakable gift for the benefit of all men. The gift cost Him much; yea, it cost Him the dearest treasure of His own heart. It was the love of God that made this provision that all mankind might have an opportunity to know the truth, receive the benefits of the ransom and live, as it is written: &quot;For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the [accurate] knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.” —1 Timothy 2: 3-6.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>Gratitude</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19251216_files/g_E_19251216-18.png" alt="" style="width:15pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">VERY sane man has a measure of gratitude in his mind. In proportion as he appreciates a kindness, in that proportion he desires to make it known to the benefactor. We therefore see that every man who comes to some knowledge of the goodness of God desires to show his appreciation of God’s goodness. This is why it is necessary to have some knowledge of the Lord in order to be the recipient of His further blessings. This is why the Devil has tried to keep the people in ignorance concerning God, knowing that if ignorant they would not even desire to do the will of God. Let each one therefore who hears these words<sub>t</sub> and appreciates the fact that he was born a sinner, and who believes that God has made provision for him to live, ask himself the question which the psalmist asks, to wit: 'What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits unto me!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some will desire to know how this question should be answered. The Prophet David, in the very next verse, answers the question as follows: “I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.” (Psalm 116:13,14) He who takes the next step, by doing what the prophet says, is certain to be the beneficiary of other great blessings.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Cup of Salvation</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19251216_files/g_E_19251216-19.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">OU may ask: What is meant by the &quot;cup of salvation”? I answer that a cup is used for containing some liquid substance to drink, and therefore symbolically represents a potion poured for one who would benefit by it. As used in this scripture it means that God has poured a draft or potion for man to drink, representing the course of action that he is to take. The Lord therefore put in the mouth of David the words which pictured or represented the course of action one must take to show his proper appreciation of the great benefit received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The one who partakes of that potion is the recipient of salvation, because it is called the &quot;cup of salvation”. No one could undertake to follow this course of action without the aid of the Lord. Therefore the psalmist says: “I will call upon the name of the Lord,” I will ask Him for help. Then he says: &quot;I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The presumption must follow that such an one has made a vow. A vow means a solemn promise to do a certain thing. And what could that promise be ? I answer: A promise to do the will of God. It means consecration. Jesus made this clear when He said (Matt. 16: 24): &quot;If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” That means that if anybody would follow the Lord he must lay aside his selfish desires and sincerely desire to do the will of God and then attempt to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Otherwise stated, consecration means this, to wit: That we are conscious of the fact that we are sinners; that Jesus Christ is our great Redeemer; that we trust in the merit of His sacrifice ; that we promise to do God’s will and call upon the Lord to help us to do His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You may ask: Is it not necessary, in order to make a consecration, to go to some meeting house, appear at the mourner’s bench, or before some preacher or priest and there confess and let him go through some ceremony in order that you might consecrate yourself? I answer: No. There is nothing in the Scriptures that warrants any such course of action. This scripture does not say: “I will call upon the name of the priest, or the pope, or the name of some preacher,” or on the name of any other man; but it does say; “I will call upon the name of the Lord.” Any man may make a consecration in his own home, or any other place, as well as in any meeting house. Yea, he can even do it better outside a meeting. His consecration means a full surrender of himself to God to do God’s will. And this he does, or may do, by quietly and alone bowing his head and heart before the Lord, and calling upon the Lord to give him grace and strength to do God’s will and to follow faithfully in the footsteps of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is how one becomes a Christian. This is man’s part of the covenant with God. When he honestly and sincerely makes this covenant he then becomes the recipient of many further blessings.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Other Benefits</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HE one thus consecrating himself to the Lord, God has promised to justify. Justification means to be made right with God. Justification during the Gospel Age, and before the kingdom is fully set up, is solely for the purpose of enabling one to become a jolnt-sacrificer with Christ Jesus. Justification means that God receives such an one, counting him right by reason of his faith in the merit of His beloved Son’s sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Jehovah begets such an one to newness of life. The word “begetting” means beginning. The Scriptures declare, in James 1:18, that this begetting is by the will of God, through His Word. In 1 Peter 1:3, 4 we are told that the begetting is to a hope of life, and in 2 Peter 1: 3,4 it states that the begetting is to the divine nature. Such an one now thus begotten becomes a new creature in Christ. As St. Paul puts it: “If any man be in Christ he is a new creature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is meant by a new creature?. It means that a man now has devoted himself to God. He has agreed to do God’s will. Hence his mind and his heart are devoted to God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Will</span><span class="font4"> means the faculty of the being by which one determines to do or not to do a certain thing. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Mind</span><span class="font4"> means the faculty of the man by which he searches out truths, considers facts and weighs them and reaches a decision. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heart</span><span class="font4"> means the faculty of the being that is the seat of motive, and that which prompts the action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No creature can exist without an organism, hence the human body is the present organism of the new<sup>7</sup> creature. It therefore means that a new creature in Christ is composed of will, mind, heart and body, all of which are devoted to the Lord. It means that such an one refuses to give allegiance to any part of the Devil’s arrangement ; that he holds himself aloof from human organizations that claim to represent the Lord^ but he follows the Lord himself. This is why a true Christian cannot support any human institution which operates under the name of “church” but which in truth and in fact is devoted to selfish things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now when David says: “I will pay my vows now in the presence of the people,” it means that one having made a vow to do the will of God, henceforth will do God’s will. It means that he will not be moved by fear for man or devil; but that moved by love for the Lord and for His cause, he will fearlessly proclaim the goodness and the loving kindness of The God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After we have done all that is possible we have not been able to show<sup>7</sup> a full appreciation of God’s goodness to us. Man’s chief duty therefore is and should be to honor the great Jehovah God and devote himself to God’s plan. What greater honor could man have than to be devoted to the Lord and to represent the Lord’s cause ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let each one therefore, propound to himself the question as David did: “What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me ?” And then with a true heart of gratitude say: My Goel is so good, so loving and so wise, I gladly will do everything within my power to honor His name. I will show forth His praises because He has called me out of darkness into the marvelous light. Even though my. faithfulness to Him shall bring upon me the persecution ef those who do not understand I shall delight te do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">true Christian is one who holds himself aloof from entangling alliances and unswervingly shows his allegiance to the Lord. The one who thus continues loyal and faithful to the end of his earthly journey is the one who receives the great reward. It is to such an one the Lord made the promise: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We notice then the closing words of the psalmist, uttered by David. After asking the question and stating the answer, then the speaker says, in verse 15: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” This means that one who thus dies faithful to the Lord is precious in God’s sight and the promise to him is, as above stated, that he shall receive the crown of life; therefore the promise is to him that he shall partake of the chief resurrection and be forever with the Lord.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark182"></a>STUDIES IN THE “HARP OF GOD”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With this issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford's* new book, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i JI S</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The Harp </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both </span><span class="font3">Advanced and Juvenile </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*<sup>a5</sup>To his disciples, and to those who should thereafter become such, Jesus said: “I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me.” (Luke 22:29) And again: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne.” (Revelation 3:21) From these scriptures it is to be seen that the C’hureh constitutes with Jesus the royal family, the kingdom class, otherwise called the seed of Abraham, through whom the blessings shall Sow out to mankind. This is the kingdom for which He taught His disciples to pray. This is the kingdom which the Prophet Daniel declares shall be set up. to have no successor; and which shall be established during the last days of the kingdoms of the unrighteous order.—Daniel 2: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">44</span><span class="font4"> ?7:14, 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■‘“The truly consecrated followers of Jesus, obedient to His admonition, have been watch mg and waiting; and those who were permitted to live at the time of His second presence and since have experienced that blessedness spoken of by Daniel at the end of the 1,335 symbolic days or years. As the great divine plan has been revealed to these, they have learned that the Lord has returned and is here, invisible to human eyes, yet exercising His great power in binding Satan and dashing to pieces the present unrighteous order, gathering unto himself His saints, and putting in order the affairs of the kingdom; that He has taken unto himself His great power to reign, and that soon all the saints shall participate with the Lord in glory in carrying out the further divine arrangement. As this string upon the harp of God is revealed to them, they sing with exultant joy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Our lamps are trimmed and burning, Our robes are white and clean;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We’ve tarried for the Bridegroom, And now we’ll enter in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We know we’ve nothing-worthy That we can call our own—■ The light, the oil, the robes we wear. Are all from Him alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Behold, behold the Bridegroom! And all may enter in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">.Whose lamps are trimmed and burning, Whose robes are white and clean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“’And these saints while yet on earth, beholding with the eye of faith the marvelous fulfilment of prophecy, are patiently waiting for the time of their glorification, when they each shall be clothed upon with a new and body like unto Jesus, the beloved Bridegroom, and when they each shall see Him as He is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘“The church means a called-out crass, separate and distinct from all others. The church of Christ consists of Jesus Christ the Head and the 144,000 members of His body. (Colossians 1: 18; Revelation 7: 4) Those composing this special class are otherwise designated saints. A saint is one who is pure, holy, blameless. The followers of Christ Jesus are not holy or blameless within themselves, but their holiness is by virtue of His imputed merit. This same class of Christians is otherwise designated in the Bible as “a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a purpose”. (1 Peter 2:9) They are also designated new creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17); therefore they constitute the new creation. This new creation when completed will be of the divine nature. (2 Peter 1:4) Nature is determined by organism. The nature of the church, then, will be like unto Jehovah God. It pleased God that Jesus Christ, His beloved Son, should have preeminence in His great plan; hence He is made the Head of the new creation. -—Colossians 1:18.</span></p>
