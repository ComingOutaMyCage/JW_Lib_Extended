God’s Gift of Holy Spirit

(Luke 11:13)



1. Sov’reign, Jehovah, merciful Father,
Greater you are than our sinful hearts.
Lighten our burden, soften our anguish,
Give us the comfort your spirit imparts.
2. Father, we all fall short of your glory;
Times there have been when we’ve lost our way.
God, we beseech you: Please may you grant us
Your holy spirit to guide us each day.
3. When we are weary, weak, or discouraged,
Your active force will our hearts renew.
Give us the strength to mount up like eagles;
May we receive holy spirit from you.



(See also Ps. 51:11; John 14:26; Acts 9:31.)
