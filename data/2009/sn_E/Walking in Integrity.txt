Walking in Integrity

(Psalm 26)



1. Please, judge me, Lord, observe my loyalty;
Observe my trust in you and my integrity.
Examine me, and put me to the test;
My mind and heart refine, that my soul might be blessed
(CHORUS)
But as for me, Determined I shall be
to walk eternally In my integrity.

2. I do not sit with wicked men of lies.
I hate the company of those who truth despise.
With evil men, take not away my life;
My soul, with those whose hands are full of bribes and strife.
(CHORUS)
But as for me, Determined I shall be
to walk eternally In my integrity.

3. For I have loved the dwelling of your house.
Your worship, oh, so pure, I daily will espouse.
And I will march around your altar grand,
To make thanksgiving heard aloud throughout the land.
(CHORUS)
But as for me, Determined I shall be
to walk eternally In my integrity.
