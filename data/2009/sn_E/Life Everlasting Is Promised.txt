Life Everlasting Is Promised

(Psalm 37:29)



1. Life everlasting is promised.
Man’s earthly home will endure.
‘Meek ones will thrive,’ said the psalmist.
This grand future is sure.
(CHORUS)
We can live forever.
It’s worth all endeavor.
God’s promise is faithful.
His Word will come true.

2. Paradise brought to perfection;
All of God’s children set free.
Under Jehovah’s direction,
Peace on earth we will see.
(CHORUS)
We can live forever.
It’s worth all endeavor.
God’s promise is faithful.
His Word will come true.

3. Soon in the grand resurrection,
Sorrow will all disappear.
Showering tender affection,
God will dry ev’ry tear.
(CHORUS)
We can live forever.
It’s worth all endeavor.
God’s promise is faithful.
His Word will come true.
