Jehovah Begins His Rule

(Revelation 11:15)



1. This is a glorious day. God’s rule is now under way.
He’s laid in Zion his Chief Cornerstone.
Let all now lift up the voice. Sing to our God, and rejoice.
Christ, Lord and Savior, has been placed upon His throne.
(CHORUS)
What will you bring, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Triumph of truth and righteousness.
And bring what else, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Eternal life and happiness.
Praise the Universal Sov’reign
For his love and faithfulness.

2. Christ now in power is here, And Armageddon is near.
Satan’s old system will soon pass away.
Now is the season to preach. Many there are yet to reach;
Time for the meek to take their stand for Him today.
(CHORUS)
What will you bring, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Triumph of truth and righteousness.
And bring what else, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Eternal life and happiness.
Praise the Universal Sov’reign
For his love and faithfulness.

3. God’s reigning Ruler we prize. Wondrous he is in our eyes.
He comes in God’s name; we bow to our King.
Enter the grand temple gate; God’s favor now supplicate.
Soon dawns that day when he rules over ev’rything.
(CHORUS)
What will you bring, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Triumph of truth and righteousness.
And bring what else, Jehovah’s Kingdom?
Eternal life and happiness.
Praise the Universal Sov’reign
For his love and faithfulness.
