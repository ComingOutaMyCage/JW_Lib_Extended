“God Is Love”

(1 John 4:7, 8)



1. God is love, and he invites us,
‘Walk with me and love my way.’
When we love both God and neighbor,
Gracious deeds will fill each day.
Therein lies the key to living;
Therein lies the life we seek.
Christlike love will never fail us.
Christlike love through us will speak.
2. Love of truth moves us to action;
Love of God moves us to love.
When we fail he seeks to help us;
By his strength we rise above.
Love is pure and never jealous;
Love is kind and bears all things.
May we grow to love our brother.
May we taste what true love brings.
3. Never let resentment lead you;
May it never take your hand.
Look to God, and he will guide you;
He will teach you these commands:
Love of God and love of neighbor,
Ev’rything that love should be.
May we always show to others
Godlike love, yes, tenderly.
