Make Me Know Your Ways

(Psalm 25:4)



1. We’re gathered together Jehovah, our God,
Accepting your warm invitation.
Your Word is a lamp that lights up our roadway,
The source of divine education.
(CHORUS)
Teach me your ways, and make me understand;
Incline my ear to hear your wise command.
Cause me to walk in ways of truth and right,
And make your law my principal delight.

2. Unreachably high is your wisdom, O God;
Your judgments we find reassuring.
Your Word is a source of unending wonder;
Your sayings of truth are enduring.
(CHORUS)
Teach me your ways, and make me understand;
Incline my ear to hear your wise command.
Cause me to walk in ways of truth and right,
And make your law my principal delight.
