“Give Us More Faith”

(Luke 17:5)



1. Because we are imperfect, O Jehovah,
The inclination of our heart is flawed.
There is a sin that easily ensnares us​—
A lack of faith in you, the living God.
(CHORUS)
Give us more faith, we beg of you, Jehovah.
Please help us out according to our need.
Give us more faith, according to your mercy,
That we may honor you in word and deed.

2. Apart from faith, no one can fully please you.
We must believe our faith will be repaid.
And as a shield, our faith provides a refuge.
We face the future firm and unafraid.
(CHORUS)
Give us more faith, we beg of you, Jehovah.
Please help us out according to our need.
Give us more faith, according to your mercy,
That we may honor you in word and deed.
