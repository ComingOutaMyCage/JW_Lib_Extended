SECTION 8
Acts 21:18–28:31
“Preaching the Kingdom of God . . . Without Hindrance”

ACTS 28:31



In this section, we will follow Paul as he faces angry mobs, endures imprisonments, and appears before the court of one Roman official after another. Through it all, the apostle continues bearing witness about God’s Kingdom. As you consider the exciting conclusion to the book of Acts, ask yourself, ‘How can I imitate this bold and zealous evangelizer?’
