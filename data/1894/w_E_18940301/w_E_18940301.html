<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE ANNUAL MEMORIAL SUPPER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THIS year, Thursday, April 19th, after six o'clock P.M., will mark the anniversary of our Lord's &quot;Last Supper,&quot; which he gave as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> memorial of his death on our behalf, saying, &quot;This do in remembrance of me.&quot;-- `Luke 22:19`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In previous issues of this magazine, we have given the evidence that the Last Supper was given us to take the place of the Jewish Paschal Supper, and to be celebrated at the corresponding time, yearly.  As the Paschal lamb typified Christ, the Lamb of God, so its death was typical of his death, and therefore his death was upon the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same day.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> We have shown, also, that the Jewish method of reckoning time, as beginning the day at six P.M., was so arranged that our Lord could institute the Last Supper upon the same night in which he was betrayed (`1 Cor. 11:23`)--the same day in which he died.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a Jew, under the Law Covenant, not yet supplanted by the New Covenant, it was the duty of our Lord to eat first of the typical lamb; and it was after that supper that he took bread and wine, as the symbols of his own flesh and blood, and instituted the Memorial Feast which we and all of his people since delight to celebrate.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Taking the place of the typical lamb, our Lord could be crucified only upon the fourteenth day of the month Nisan; and the commemoration of his death, and the passing over thereby effected, taking the place of the commemoration of the Passover lamb and that typical passing over, it follows that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">commemoration</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the antitype should be an annual observance, as was the commemoration of the type.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This we have seen was the custom of the early Church, which adopted for centuries the Jewish method of reckoning which we follow; viz., the evening, following the thirteenth of Nisan, which was the beginning of the fourteenth. This method of reckoning was afterward changed by the Church of Rome, although the thought and custom of a yearly commemoration of our Lord's death is still observed on &quot;Good Friday&quot; by the Church of Rome, the Greek Church, the Syrian Church and the English Church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Protestant Churches got the Romish doctrine of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mass</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> confounded with the Lord's Supper, whereas they have no correspondence (See </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mass</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in M. DAWN, VOL. III. Pp.98-101); and as a result they adopted various times and seasons, morning, noon and night, and monthly, bi-monthly and quarterly, seeing no reason for any particular date, and supposing that the Apostle's words, &quot;as oft as ye do it,&quot; etc., Give full license to celebrate it at any time. On the contrary, we understand the Apostle to mean, Every time (yearly) that ye do this.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some dear Christian people have even fallen into the error of commemorating this feast every first day of the week; because they have not noticed what the supper means in connection with the type which it displaces; and because they erroneously think that they find a precedent for their course in the expression of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1625 : page 68::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the New Testament, &quot;On the first day of the week, when the disciples were come together to break bread.&quot;  This does indeed show that breaking of bread every first day was the custom of the early disciples; but it does not prove that the Memorial Supper is meant. Indeed, the fruit of the vine was as important as the bread in the memorial; but it is never mentioned in connection with these weekly meetings for breaking of bread and for prayers. These, on the contrary, celebrated, not our Lord's death, but his resurrection.  They were remembrancers, not of the Last Supper, but of the &quot;breaking of bread&quot; on the day of our Lord's resurrection, when their eyes were opened and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Had the Memorial Supper been meant, it surely would have been so stated.  Like ourselves, the early disciples ate or brake bread </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> day: but they did not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">come together</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to do it except on the first day of the week, which celebrated our Lord's resurrection and not his death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A little investigation will convince any one that these weekly gatherings were customary</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1626 : page 68::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">with all Jews, who, however, met on the last or seventh day and on festivals, instead of on the first day of the week for their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;social&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> meals.  On this point let us quote from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">McClintock</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and Strong's Religious Cyclopedia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Vol. 8, page 68, merely enough to corroborate our statement above, as follows:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In consequence of the vigorous laws about the observance of the Sabbath, it was enacted that no Israelite is to walk on the Sabbath beyond a certain distance, called a &quot;Sabbath-day's journey,&quot; nor carry anything from one house to another.  The Sadducees, or priestly party, who celebrated their meals on the Sabbath in different places, could go from one to another, and carry to and fro anything they liked, because they regarded these meals as constituting part of their priestly and sacrificial service, which set aside the sanctity of the Sabbath.  But the Pharisees, who made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sabbatic repast resemble</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> THE PRIESTLY SOCIAL MEALS, had to encounter difficulties arising from the vigorous Sabbatic laws.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE CELEBRATION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Simplicity should combine with reverence in all of our worship; and our Lord's example in respect to this memorial speaks of solemnity combined with simplicity and reverence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On Thursday evening after six o'clock, April 19th, therefore, let as many as love the Redeemer and have pledged themselves to be his followers in faith and practice, celebrate his death--&quot;for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.&quot; Meet with all of like precious faith convenient to you, who would like to meet and celebrate this, the greatest event of history.  It is to be a gathering of professedly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consecrated believers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Redeemer; but if others come in making such profession reject them not: remember that Judas met with the Lord and the other eleven.  Remember, too, that the greatest among you is servant of all, who washes the feet; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Performs even the humblest service for the cleansing of God's people from the defilements of earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The emblems used by our Lord were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unleavened</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;bread&quot; and &quot;fruit of the vine.&quot; Unleavened cakes can generally be had of some Jewish neighbors for a few cents; if not, water crackers are practically the same thing.  It is probable that our Lord used a &quot;light&quot; wine; but he has merely said, &quot;fruit of the vine&quot;: hence we may with propriety use unfermented grape juice or raisin-juice--from raisins stewed in water.  This is as truly fruit of the vine as intoxicating wine would be.  And we believe that our Lord would approve it, seeing how many are now addicted to the abuse of liquor, and might be misled by even a taste of such wines as are generally obtainable.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In our April 1st issue we will make a few remarks upon the meaning of these symbols.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE ALLEGHENY MEMORIAL SERVICE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The service here will be held, as usual, in Bible House chapel, No. 58 Arch St., at 7.30 O'clock P.M.  All who trust in our Lord Jesus' death as their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and who are fully consecrated to him, will be made very welcome. But we extend no special invitation to visitors</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1626 : page 69::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">from a distance this year; nor are there any arrangements for other than our usual Sunday services, except as above mentioned.  If there be any </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">solitary</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ones in near-by towns, we shall be glad to have them attend with us; but where there are even two or three who can unite in this memorial, our suggestion is that they had best meet together at home.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">On previous occasions of conventions here, we have always been rather painfully aware of the fact that the various local gatherings of believers were interfered with and impaired by the absence of those who were most needed. This year we would like to see this matter quite reversed; and therefore advise that, wherever even two or three can meet together, they do so; and that even the solitary ones, if within reach of a larger and a smaller circle of believers, prefer to give their presence to the smaller rather than the larger gathering, and thus encourage and help those who need their presence most.  Those who thus strive to do good to others will be the more blest themselves.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We request that a Postal Card Report from each little group celebrating this Memorial be made out by the one who officiates on the occasion, and sent to the TOWER office the next day.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE UNJUST STEWARD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">--`LUKE 16:1-8`.--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THIS parable furnishes a text for a discourse on the claims of God and Mammon upon Christians. (`Verses 9-16`.)  The parable is plain, if it be borne in mind that stewards in olden times had much greater power and authority committed to them than now.  They had all the authority of the master himself to make and to settle accounts.  The steward of this narrative, when informed that he was about to lose his situation, used the power still vested in him to make personal friends out of his master's debtors, by treating them leniently. When the master of this worldly-wise steward heard of his course, he commended it as a stroke of worldly wisdom and prudence.  Nor are we sure that the steward's course was one working injury to his employer's real interests: in view of the disproportionate reductions of twenty per cent on one account and fifty per cent on the other, it seems not improbable that the steward saw that the one never could pay more than fifty per cent of his debt, nor the other more than eighty per cent of his.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This illustration of worldly wisdom or prudent thought for his own interests in the future was our Lord's text for a little discourse to his disciples.  They were each stewards of certain talents, opportunities, money, etc.  Two masters claimed their allegiance; viz., Sin and Righteousness, and they must choose to which they would be loyal; for they could not serve both.  &quot;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Sin claimed them and all of Adam's race, with all their talents, as his servants, since all had been &quot;sold under [captivity to] Sin.&quot; They knew, however, that Sin had no just, no true right of control, but merely one of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">force:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hence in every way that they could they had a right and privilege to divert their talents from the service of Sin and to devote them to the good of others.  Wealth and influence in the present time are properly reckoned as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mammon</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Sin.  Sin, at present the master of the world, is represented as having control, not only of the people (`Rom. 6:12,14,17,18,22,23`; `7:14`), but also of all the wealth-talents of the present; so that he claims each individual to be merely his steward, and demands that he use his mammon in his interest, else he will dispossess him.  But our Lord taught that allegiance really belonged to another Master, even God, and that they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">should not serve Sin;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that our Lord, as God's representative, was about to set up God's Kingdom, and overthrow Sin-- binding the strong Master of the present time and spoiling his arrangements. (`Matt. 12:29`; `Mark 3:27`.)  In view of this knowledge, our Lord said to his disciples:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends out of [or by means of] the mammon of unrighteousness [the earthly wealth or valuables under your control now, which at one time</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1626 : page 70::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">were in whole or in part controlled by Sin, your long-time task-master]; that when ye fail [when the present life ends], they may receive you into lasting habitations,&quot; into heavenly conditions--the using of our talents, once active in Sin's service, in the Lord's service being counted as laying up treasures in heaven.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the wise, proper course, whether you have little of earthly riches--honor, money, talent--or whether you have much; for &quot;he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and [knowing to which master his allegiance and talents really belong] he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If, to please &quot;the prince of this world&quot; and to be in harmony with those who serve him, you own Sin as your master and selfishly serve him, using time and talents as his steward, for the short time of the present life, and for the small advantages which such a course would bring</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1627 : page 70::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">you, your unfaithfulness in these respects would prove you unworthy of the share promised to you in real riches of the real kingdom soon to be set up.--`Rom. 6:14-18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As those who have deserted the service of Sin the Usurper, and who have consecrated their all to God, you have been appointed by him stewards of those consecrated talents, with a promise that if faithful he will in the world to come make you more than stewards--kings and priests unto God.  But if you prove unfaithful to your stewardship, if you love and serve mammon [wealth, either honor, money or other wealth of this world, highly esteemed by all natural men], can you hope that God will give you the true Kingdom riches which are yours conditionally?  Be assured, &quot;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This was our Lord's discourse to his disciples respecting their proper course in life as stewards of the manifold grace of God.  &quot;And the Pharisees who were covetous [who dearly loved the riches and honors of this present time] heard all these things; and they derided [ridiculed] him.  And he said unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Ye are they which justify yourselves before men [you succeed in getting men to think you very holy]; but God knoweth your hearts [that much that you do is merely of outward show, mock humility and pretended self-denials]: for that which is highly esteemed among men [which deceives the natural man, which he thinks very praiseworthy] is abomination in the sight of God.&quot;--`Luke 16:14,15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Law and the Prophets were until John, --but now a new dispensation is being ushered in; and if you were wise you would see the change at hand and begin to act accordingly. Now the Kingdom of God is preached, and every man desires to get into it.  You therefore should begin at once to so dispose of the stewardship yet in your hands that you might at least be on favorable terms with those who shall so soon possess the power of the Kingdom. This, to the Jews, was not a case of deserting the Law Covenant to which they were married; the Law Covenant was fulfilled, died a natural death, which permitted them to give their allegiance to Christ and the New Covenant.-- `Verse 18`; `Rom. 7:4`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--I cannot tell you how highly I have appreciated the WATCH TOWER of 1893.  I have derived much spiritual benefit from its study.  Every number has been full of rich things--things which should be treasured up in the hearts of those who are running for the great prize and striving to make their calling and election </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sure.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Your aim has been to make the TOWER readers better men and women--more like our blessed Redeemer and Lord, and also to protect them from the snares of the adversary.</font><br />

I changed all the pronouns to the first person singular.  I consider this an excellent way to study the TOWER, and would recommend it highly to all its readers.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is what it is to be established in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> truth.  It is indeed a most blessed condition, bringing with it such peace and joy as the world can neither give nor take away.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But though I be thus established in the present truth, there are quite a number of</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   That my election to the high position to which I am called is not yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">made sure</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the race for the prize of my high calling is still before me.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I am yet in the enemy's country, surrounded by many subtle and powerful foes.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That if I would be successful I must fight the good fight of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FAITH.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That the weapons of my warfare are not carnal, but (God's truth is) mighty to the pulling down of the strongholds of error, superstition and inbred sin.--`2 Cor. 10:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I wrestle not with flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;-- `Eph. 6:12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That it is in view of the warfare before me-- the subtlety of my temptations, the weaknesses of the flesh--that the faithful Peter urges </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> diligence in the cultivation of the Christian graces, and a continual calling to remembrance of the precious truths I have learned--that I may be strengthened for the conflict, and thereby able to make my calling and election </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sure.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That faith is a good thing (without which I cannot please God, I cannot be justified, I cannot maintain my justification or have access into the additional favor, I cannot be an overcomer); yet faith without virtuous works is dead; and to hold the truth in unrighteousness is worse than never to have received it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That the truth is given to me for its sanctifying effect upon my heart and life--it should have free course and be glorified--its precious fruits should appear more and more from day to day.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I must add to my faith, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">VIRTUE</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- true excellence of character that will mark me as separated from the world and its spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That in me the world should see those moral qualities which they must approve--however they may oppose (the objects of) my faith.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I must add sterling honesty, truth and fair dealing in all business relations; moral integrity in all social relations; manifestly clean hands and a pure heart, and a bridled tongue that works no ill to a neighbor.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That all of these the world has a right to expect from me and all others who call themselves Christians; and that all of these are indispensable features of that virtuous character which must be added to my faith.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That if my hands be clean, they will not dabble in anything that is not virtuous;--they will have nothing to do with unrighteous schemes or projects in business.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That if my heart be pure, it will not devise evil things, or harbor evil thoughts, or plot mischief.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That the promptings of virtue go further than merely these negative features which refuse to do anything which would work ill to a neighbor; they incite not only to passive, but also to active goodness--in benevolent charity which seeks to alleviate suffering; to sympathize with sorrow; to comfort those in distress, and to elevate and bless others; to assist &quot;all men as&quot; I &quot;have opportunity.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1628 : page 72::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">not to be hasty, hot-tempered, rash or thoughtless; but endeavoring to be evenly balanced, thoughtful and considerate.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That my whole manner should be characterized by that carefulness which would indicate that I am ever mindful of the Lord's pleasure, of my responsibility to him as his representative, and of my influence upon my fellow-men to see that it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">always</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be for good, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">never</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for evil.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That this grace smooths the way for every other, because all must be acquired under the process of patient and continuous self-discipline; and that not a step of progress can be gained without the exercise of this grace.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That not one of the graces more beautifully adorns the Christian character, wins the approval of the world's conscience or glorifies the God of all grace, whose truth inspires it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That it is long-suffering meekness earnestly striving to stem the tide of human imperfection and weakness, and endeavoring with painstaking care to regain the divine likeness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That it is slow to wrath and plenteous in mercy; quick to perceive the paths of truth and righteousness and prompt to walk in them; mindful of its own imperfections, and sympathetic with the imperfections and shortcomings of others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I must add to &quot;patience </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">GODLINESS&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --I must carefully study and imitate the divine character as presented in the Word.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I must exercise </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">BROTHERLY</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">KINDNESS</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> towards my fellowman.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I must add to brotherly kindness </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LOVE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That kindness may be manifested where but little love exists toward the subject of such kindness; but I cannot long persevere in such acts of kindness before a sympathetic interest is awakened; and by and by that interest, continually exercised, deepens into love, and even though the subject may be unlovely in character the love of sympathy for the fallen and the degraded grows, until it becomes tender and solicitous and akin to that of a parent for an erring son.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That Peter describes a most admirable character --one which cannot be acquired in a day, nor a year, but the whole life must be devoted to it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That day by day, if I am faithful, I will be able to realize a measure of growth in grace and development of Christian character.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That it is not enough that I know the truth --nor should I be contented to hold it in unrighteousness. I must see to it that the truth is having its legitimate and designed effect upon the character.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That if I receive the truth into a good and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">honest</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> heart, I have the assurance of the Apostle that I shall never fall, and that in due time I shall be received into the Kingdom of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That I should see the necessity of ever keeping the instructions and precepts of the Lord fresh in my mind, and of drinking deep into their inspiring spirit--although I am already established in the faith.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That to be established in the faith is one thing, and to be established in Christian character and in all the graces of the spirit is quite another.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In claiming to be a divinely recognized child of God and a follower of his dear Son, I stand before the world as God's representative; and, presumably, all my words and actions are in harmony with his indwelling Spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I stand as a guide-post in the midst of the world's dark and uncertain way; and, if I am not true to my profession, I am a deceitful sign-board, causing the inquirer to lose the right way and to stumble into many a snare. Therefore, to take the name of God, claiming to be his son, a Christian, a follower of Christ, without a fixed determination and careful effort to fairly represent him, is a sin against God of which I will not be held guiltless!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I realize that to undertake the Christian life is to engage in a great warfare against iniquity; for, though the grace of God abounds to me through Christ to such an extent that my imperfections and short-comings are not imputed to me, but robed in Christ's imputed righteousness I am reckoned holy and acceptable to God, I am not, says the Apostle (`Rom. 6:1,2`),</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1628 : page 73::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">to continue in sin that grace may abound; for by my covenant with God I have declared myself dead to sin and that I have no longer any desire to live therein.  But having made such a covenant with God and having taken upon myself his holy name, if I continue in sin, or cease to strive against sin, I am proving false to my profession. (`Rom. 6:1,2,11,12`.) This means a great deal.  It means a constant warfare against the easily besetting sins of my old nature; and the struggle will be long and constant until the power of sin is broken; and then only constant vigilance will keep it down.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If I be true to my profession, I will daily strive to realize an increasing mastery over sin in myself, and will be able from time to time to distinguish some degree of advancement in this direction.  I will grow more like Christ-- more self-possessed, more meek and gentle, more disciplined and refined, more temperate in all things, and more fully possessed of the mind that was in Christ Jesus.  My old temper and unlovely disposition will disappear, and my new mind will assert its presence and power. And thus the silent example of a holy life will reflect honor upon that holy name which it is my privilege to bear and to represent before the world, as a living epistle, known and read of all men with whom I come in contact. I realize that the formation of such a noble and pure character is the legitimate result of the reception of divine truth into a good and honest heart.  Or, rather, such is the transforming power of divine truth upon the whole character, when it is heartily received and fully submitted to.  &quot;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth,&quot; was the Lord's petition on the Church's behalf; and may I not fall into the error of some, of presuming that the sanctifying work can go on better without the truth than with it?--`2 Peter 1:4`; `1 John 3:3`; `John 15:3`; `17:17`; `Eph. 5:26`; `Rom. 12:2`; `2 Cor. 3:18`; `7:1`; `Psa. 19:7-14`; `1 Tim. 4:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I need the instruction and guidance and inspiration of the truth for holy living; and our Lord's words imply that all the truth that is necessary to this end is in the Word of God, and that, consequently, I am not to look for any further revelations through visions or dreams or imaginations of myself or others. The Word of God, says the Apostle (`2 Tim. 3:16,17`), is profitable for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doctrine,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reproof,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">correction,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">instruction in righteousness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Heb. 4:12`), that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.  It reveals to me the spirit, mind or disposition of God, and exhorts me to let the same mind dwell richly in me; and in conjunction with the study of the mind of God as revealed in his Word and communion with him in prayer, I receive the blessed influences of his spirit, which brings me more and more into conformity with his perfect will.  I realize that to live a holy life is not to do some great and wonderful things: it is only to live from day to day a life of quiet unostentatious conformity to the will of God--of secret communion with him in my closet, devotions and daily walk, and of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">jealous activity to the extent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of my ability and opportunity in his service.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> As I have named the name of Christ (`2 Tim. 2:19`), it is my determination--God helping me--to depart (more and more) from iniquity and apply my heart unto instruction, confident that I shall be led of God into green pastures and beside still waters: my table will be richly and bountifully spread, and my cup of blessing and joy and gladness will overflow; while the wrath of God will in due time be revealed against all who take his hallowed name in vain, however they may band themselves together, and however loudly they may proclaim themselves heaven's appointed messengers.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PERSONAL LIBERTY,--ITS RESPONSIBILITY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">LIBERTY always increases responsibility. Each consecrated believer has the full liberty to use his consecrated talents in the Lord's service; but each should see to it that he does not misuse this liberty.  Some are naturally inclined to undervalue their own abilities, and hence fail to be so useful servants of the truth as they might be.  Others overestimate their natural talents, and waste valuable opportunities in trying to do things for which they have little or no talent; and neglect the exercise of other talents which they really do possess.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Use not your liberty for an occasion of the flesh&quot;--to cultivate pride and vainglory in yourself </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">or in others.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Let a man &quot;think [of himself] soberly, according as God hath dealt out to every man the measure of faith.&quot; &quot;All things are lawful for me [permitted by the loose rein of Christ's commands], but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1628 : page 74::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Having then </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">gifts differing,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> according to the grace given unto us&quot;--whether our gift be a qualification for prophecy, serving, teaching, exhorting, giving of means, or presiding, let us use to our best ability the gift or gifts possessed; rather than fail by trying to use other gifts not granted to us;-- &quot;In honor preferring one another,&quot;--&quot;Mind not high things,&quot;--&quot;Be not wise in your own conceits.&quot;--`Rom. 12:3-16`; `1 Cor. 10:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1629 : page 74::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   These Scriptural injunctions apply to everything we may do, or endeavor to do, in the Lord's service.  Those who have the money talent should not only use it &quot;with simplicity&quot; (without ostentation), but they should use it with wisdom.  It should not go to assist in preaching either slight errors or gross ones, if they know it--neither by assisting in paying the expenses of meetings, nor in paying publishing expenses.  And each one should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> directly or indirectly, what he is assisting to promulgate as truth.  If you have read and failed to comprehend a publication, do not suppose your mind incapable of grasping anything so deep and complex, and then proceed to circulate it among others; but conclude that if you have not the mental capacity to understand it, your safest plan will be not to run the risk of choking anyone else with it. &quot;Whatever is not of faith is sin,&quot; applies to this as well as to other matters.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These criticisms apply to WATCH TOWER publications as well as to others.  Prove by God's Word all that you receive from this office.  (1) See if it squares with the doctrine of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if it does not, you need go no further with the proving.  (2) If it is in accord with that foundation of the gospel, proceed to examine it in the light of all the Scriptures.  (3) If it stands these tests receive it and hold it fast, as being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">from God;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and (4) circulate it wherever you can.  (5) But if ever you get from us either tract or paper which you do not find in harmony with the Scriptures, surely let us know wherein it disagrees, and do not circulate it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This advice in no way conflicts with our Lord's words in `Mark (9:39`), when, in reply to the disciples' statement that they had forbidden some one to cast our devils because he followed not with them, he said, &quot;Forbid him not.&quot;  It is not for us to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forbid</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> anyone the exercise of his own talents according to his own wisdom.  But if any one exercise his talents in a manner which we consider unwise or wholly or partially erroneous, it is our duty </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not to render any</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">assistance to the unwise course.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It is one thing to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forbid,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and to use sword and fagot to restrain, and quite another thing to leave them to themselves and to exercise your own talents according to your own judgment of the Lord's will.  Some who are only babes in the present truth send in manuscript for publication in the TOWER and as tracts.  With childlike simplicity they sometimes remark that their articles, etc., are chiefly extracts from the DAWN and TOWER. We have but one motive in publishing-- namely, to disseminate the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the Editor understands the Word of God to teach it.  Let others publish what they please, and how they please; we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forbid them not,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">assist them not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if they follow not the lines of truth as we have been guided of the Lord to see them, and are seeking to follow them.  Nevertheless, to guard against the rejection of truth from other quarters, if the Lord shall choose to send it, we have appointed a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">committee of three,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> consisting of the Associate Editor and two others, to examine every article sent in for publication. Upon the recommendation of any two of that committee the Editor will publish any manuscript sent in;--even though he should think it necessary to review and contradict the conclusions reached.  It is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the truth only, that we desire to publish and circulate, and that in the best form of statement known to us.  Take it kindly, therefore, if your articles are oftenest rejected; and know nevertheless of our love and sympathy and appreciation of your desires and efforts.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of the dear friends while desiring to do good are in danger of doing the reverse, by expecting that MILLENNIAL DAWN colporteurs have all the gifts and talents necessary for the public expounding of the truth, and therefore encouraging some to do so who have not those talents.  This is a serious mistake which has already drawn some discredit upon the truths we all love to honor.  The leaven of pride and ambition is perhaps not yet fully purged out of any, but is merely kept in subjection by grace; and all require help to overcome it and to purge it out, rather than suggestions, etc., which might develop it.  Let us consider one another to provoke to love and good works.  If you find a humble one with ability, encourage him in its exercise; but</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1629 : page 75::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">if he be not humble minded encourage him not, even though he have the ability; for the higher you push him the greater will be his fall; because &quot;Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.&quot;-- `Prov. 16:18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">None love or appreciate the Colporteurs and the work they are doing for the Lord and his sheep in the spread of the truth more than do we.  But none more than we realize the danger to which some of them are exposed by dear Brethren and Sisters who, meeting them, expect that they are Masters in Israel and able expounders of the Word.  In endeavoring to meet this expectation some stumble over supposed types, and some over parables and over symbols of Revelation, and in general, over &quot;questions to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearer.&quot;  Read `2 Tim. 2:14-21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course the abilities or talents of God's servants differ; and it is proper that we should encourage such as have talents to use the best they possess in the most useful manner; but great care should be exercised to encourage only the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">humble,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and then only in the exercise of talents or gifts </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possessed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and not in grasping for gifts with which they are not endowed.  Our experience surely confirms the Lord's Word, that Not many great or learned or wise hath God chosen--now, nor at any time.  Surely our Lord's leading and blessing seem to have accompanied the circulation of the printed truth in a remarkable degree, in the present harvest: Had he desired that the work be carried on in another way, he would have raised up more possessing the requisite abilities.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lord's blessing has wonderfully attended the colporteur work; so that through this agency over half a million volumes of the DAWN series are in the hands of the people, each preaching sixteen sermons on the Bible over and over again, and yielding greater and more lasting results than any public speaking. But the tendency we here mention (far more than the stringency of the times) has recently caused a great slackening of the colporteur work.  Some of the ablest &quot;harvesters&quot; are doing less than one-tenth what they formerly did.  And this in turn puts them back in their accounts with the TOWER office, so that at present the indebtedness of Colporteurs amounts to about seven thousand dollars, and causes serious inconvenience at a time when it is difficult to borrow money at a high rate of interest. This latter, however, is a secondary matter.  We are glad to be able to give credit to all who need it, and whose time and energy are being expended in the work in the manner for which they have shown that they have the necessary gift or talents.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If we thought this to be a leading of Divine Providence, pointing us to a change of methods, we should at once fall into line with it and cooperate. But we do not so view it.  We believe, on the contrary, that it is but another of Satan's delusions and snares by which he would hinder the work and injure the harvest laborers.  If we knew of any better publications for presenting the truth than those of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tower Tract Society,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we would surely discontinue present publications and put our energy upon those.  But so long as you and we know of no other publications in any degree entering the field of present truth and standing fast upon the one foundation--the ransom --we cannot doubt that this agency, so far used, should continue to be used, with all of our united energies, until the Lord shall say &quot;Well done, thou good and faithful servant: ...enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,&quot; or until we see some </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">better</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> way and are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sure</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is the Lord's way.  On the contrary, the Lord is continually sending out new laborers, and opening the way for translations of M. DAWN into other languages.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Since Christmas a Baptist Brother has received the truth, and is working at his trade and laying by the money needful to defray his expenses to New Zealand, where he hopes to spread the truth.  And we have a proposition from two others to go to Australia.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All who are in agreement with the above sentiments should cast their influence by word and deed with their judgment.  But let none misunderstand the loving motive which prompts you.  Speak the truth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Eph. 4:15`); &quot;others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire.&quot;--`Jude 21-23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To those possessed of fewer or humbler talents than some others, and who are diligently and faithfully using such as they do possess, we would suggest that the time is not far distant when all the faithful will be crowned with the perfect abilities which will be common to all who shall become partakers of the divine nature.  Meantime, each should use what talents he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">has</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the best of his ability; assured that the faithful over one or two talents will receive the same blessed plaudit as the faithful with five talents--&quot;Well done, thou good and faithful servant:...enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.&quot;</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JACOB AT BETHEL.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. QUAR., LESSON X., MAR. 11, `GEN. 28:10-22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee.&quot;--`Gen. 28:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   `VERSES 10,11`. Because of his faith in the promises of God and his appreciation of them, Jacob now undertook a long and lonely journey on foot, and unaccompanied, that he might escape the murderous wrath of his brother.  And in so doing he was leaving behind him and practically abandoning the earthly inheritance of flocks and herds, the wealth of his father Isaac, to</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1630 : page 76::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Esau his brother, while he went forth empty-handed, with nothing but his staff.  But he had what he appreciated more than all else, the blessed inheritance of the Abrahamic covenant, whose fulfilment could not be reasonably expected until the city for which Abraham looked (`Heb. 11:10`, the Kingdom of God) should be established in the earth.  He evidently did not expect temporal blessings, and he actually forsook them; but while he sought first the Kingdom of God and its righteousness, all needful temporal blessings, and more, were added.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSES 12-15`. Here is sufficient evidence of the correctness of our estimate of Jacob's character, as presented in our last lesson.  Jacob was neither condemned nor repudiated by God.  On the contrary, his faith and his appreciation of God's promise made him beloved of God; and now, as he was a wanderer from home and family for the sake of his trust in God's promises, God went with him on his lonely journey; and this confirmation of the original covenant must have been most refreshing and strengthening to him.  Truly, &quot;If God be for us, who can be against us?&quot;--`Rom. 8:31`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A comparison of `verse 14` with `chap. 22:17` will show that while the Abrahamic covenant was to have a double fulfilment-- first, in a literal sense to him and his posterity; and, second, in a spiritual sense to the spiritual children of God of whom Abraham was a type (`Rom. 4:17`--margin), and who are therefore called the children of Abraham--this covenant makes mention only of the literal fulfilment which is to be realized by Jacob and his descendants-- &quot;Israel after the flesh&quot;--as well as by Abraham and Isaac and all the prophets who shall constitute the earthly phase of the Kingdom of God.--See MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. I., Chap. xiv.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The promise to Abraham in part was, &quot;I will multiply thy seed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as the stars of heaven,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as the sand which is upon the sea</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shore,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which language, in the light of subsequent revelations of the Apostles, is seen to signify both a spiritual and an earthly seed, the former being Christ and his body, the Gospel Church (`Gal. 3:16,29`), and the latter, the literal descendants of Abraham and Jacob--&quot;Israel after the flesh.&quot;  And in this seed of Abraham and posterity of Jacob, in both the literal and spiritual senses, all the families of the earth shall be blessed. The two phases of the Kingdom will cooperate in the glorious and blessed work of the restitution of all things, foretold by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began.--`Acts 3:19-21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSE 15` was the blessed assurance to Jacob of that which is now very shortly to be brought to pass, and which is even now beginning to be fulfilled.  It signifies the regathering of Israel--often called Jacob; see `Rom. 11:26`--to the land of promise.  It signifies not only their regathering out from among all the nations whither they have been scattered (`Ezek. 11:17`; `20:34,41`; `28:25`), but also their coming out of their graves. (`Ezek. 37:12-14`.)  Consequently, at the appointed time (See MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. II.), we expect that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets and all Israel will be regathered from &quot;the land of the enemy&quot;--the grave, and from among all nations whither they have been scattered, and firmly planted in the land which God sware unto Abraham and unto Isaac and unto Jacob.  We expect all this and much more when the city is established for which Abraham looked, and unto the promise of which all the ancient worthies had respect. --See MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. III.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`VERSES 16-19`. Jacob's reverent appreciation of the Lord's communion with him in the dream is commendable.  Wherever God communes with his people the place becomes a sanctuary--Bethel, or house of</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;And wheresoe'er God's people meet</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     There they may find the mercy seat:</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     Where'er they seek him, he is found,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     And every place is hallowed ground.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   `VERSES 20-22`. A realization of God's favor, instead of making Jacob arrogant and haughty, as less noble natures are often affected, led him in humility to a grateful consecration of himself to God, and to a sense of his own unworthiness.  The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;if&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in this verse might more properly be substituted by the words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">since, or inasmuch</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because Jacob is not here introducing a condition with God, but is expressing his acceptance of God's promise (of `verse 15`) to do these things.  Then note how moderate were Jacob's desires for temporal blessings.  All he craved for the present life were the simple necessaries of existence, while he solemnly obligated himself to tax all that he might in future acquire at the rate of 10 per cent, for the Lord's special service. And there he set up a memorial pillar that that place should ever thereafter be to him a sacred place of worship and a reminder of the goodness of God, of his covenant and of the obligations which he had assumed as a thank-offering to the Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This grateful consecration on Jacob's part was a voluntary offering, not from constraint, but from love and gratitude.  And in the course of all the ancient worthies who shall inherit the earthly phase of the Kingdom we see the same spirit of grateful sacrifice, which is only excelled by that of our Lord Jesus and those who closely follow in his footsteps, freely consecrating and actually sacrificing, not only one tenth, but all that they have--even unto death--that they may thereby accomplish the work which God has given them to do, and prove their worthiness of the covenant blessings to the spiritual house of Israel and seed of Abraham.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who have thus solemnly covenanted to present themselves as living sacrifices together with Christ, that thereby they may be heirs together with him of the spiritual blessings vouchsafed in this Abrahamic covenant, would do well to mark with what faithfulness the heirs of the earthly inheritance paid their vows unto the Most High. Mark also how thoroughly they were tested, and how bravely they stood the tests applied; and from their noble examples let us take courage while we run our race, inspired by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exceeding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> great and precious promises hidden for us also in that Abrahamic covenant.  If Jacob asked no more than the actual necessities for the present life, surely we may be satisfied with nothing more; while we look for a still more glorious inheritance in the promised time of blessing.  &quot;Having food and raiment, let us therewith be content.&quot;--`1 Tim. 6:8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet it is to be feared that many who covenant to sacrifice their all in the Lord's service actually render far less than one tenth.  The size of our sacrifice is the measure of our love and zeal in the Lord's service; and time and influence, as well as financial ability, are parts of our possessions to be rendered to the Lord as thank-offerings, while out of that consecrated to him the things needful for our sustenance may be retained in harmony with the spirit of our covenant.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And, while we run, let us remember for our consolation the promise to Jacob, and through him to us--&quot;Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee.&quot;  &quot;Faithful is he who hath called you, who also will do it.&quot; --`1 Thes. 5:24`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">The moral precepts of this lesson need little comment; but it is well for all to lay them to heart.  There can be no vital piety where the simple precepts of morality are ignored.  He who would live godly must, at the outset, abandon every vile and evil thing--must seek to purify the earthen vessel, and pray for divine grace to keep it so, and he must earnestly strive against all the downward tendencies of his fallen nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been well said that the intemperate use of spiritous liquors is an apt illustration of the course and effects of sin in general.  It benumbs the sensibilities, beclouds and stupefies the judgment, weakens the will, enslaves and degrades the whole man, and finally wrecks his health and all his manly hopes and aspirations, and brings him in haste and disgrace to the grave.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yet, while this vice is a visible and most prominent illustration of the course and effects of sin, such is the actual tendency of all sin, though its effects may not always be</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1631 : page 78::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">so visible, nor so hateful, nor so rapidly ruinous. All sin is intolerable in the sight of God; and to love and cherish it in its less obnoxious and more secret forms is as worthy of condemnation as enslavement to its grosser forms.  Only those who abhor sin in all its forms, and who strive against the sinward tendencies of their fallen nature, and who, because of such realized and acknowledged tendencies, avail themselves of the robe of Christ's righteousness through faith in his precious blood as their ransom price, are acceptable to God.  Let us flee, therefore, from every sin, and from every appearance of evil; and let us manifest our hatred of sin by a continual and lifelong striving against it; and day by day and year by year will manifest more and more of a mastery over it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Below we add some statistics showing in figures something of the immense expense of the single sin of intemperance in the use of spiritous liquors; yet we may safely say that the half cannot be told in any such way. But who can compute the enormous expense of the whole retinue of sins, great and small, to our fallen and enslaved humanity? What enormous expense of misery and wretchedness has been incurred, for instance, by the intemperate propagation of the human species, begotten in sin, shapen in iniquity, and brought forth with the deeply engraven hereditary marks of sin into a world of temptations, deceptions and snares!</font><br />

But, while avoiding the multiplying of the forms of godliness, whose tendency is to impoverish its spirit, it is quite in place for Christians to reverently and joyfully call to mind the Lord's resurrection on its anniversary.  The birth, death and resurrection of our Lord are the three circumstances of his first advent which should be remembered by every child of God with reverent thanksgiving and praise. His birth was the dawn of hope for our race, as Simeon said, &quot;Now...mine eyes have seen thy salvation;&quot; his death was the seal of pardon and peace to every believer in his precious blood; and his resurrection was the assurance which God gave to all</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">men of the efficacy of his precious blood and of their consequent privilege of sharing the ransom blessing of restitution by faith and obedience.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The resurrection of Jesus is the guarantee of God's expressed purpose to restore to life and to all the blessings of his favor all of the human race who come unto God by him.  And it is in view of this fact, that God declares himself the God of the living, and not of the dead, for they all live unto him (`Luke 20:37,38`)--in his purpose.  And, because of this also, our Lord spoke of death as a sleep,--in view of the awakening in the morning of the resurrection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Death implies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">extinction;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for if once condemned by God as unworthy of life, there being no chance for reform or change in death (&quot;In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks!&quot;) it follows that there could be no hope in death.  But what man could not do for himself God has done for him through Christ,--He has redeemed man from the death sentence and provided for the reawakening of all.  Therefore God does not think of us as dead (annihilated), but as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sleeping</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until the Millennial morning.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is interesting to note with what carefulness the important facts of the death and resurrection of the Lord are noted in the Scriptures: that so our faith and hope might be firmly established; for, said the Apostle, &quot;If Christ be not risen, your hope is vain.&quot; The precautions, too, were taken not by the Lord's friends, but by his enemies.--`Matt. 27:62-66`; `John 19:34,35`.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;OUT OF DARKNESS INTO HIS MARVELOUS LIGHT.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--For many years I have been familiar with your name and with the title, MILLENNIAL DAWN, and have occasionally met those who have accepted your views of Bible interpretation; but I have never been inclined to look into the teachings you put forth until about a month ago, when some ladies, who were at one time members of a church (undenominational) over which I was pastor, became interested in Brother West's teachings, and wrote to me desiring to know whether I had read MILLENNIAL DAWN, and what I thought of the same, finally sending me VOL. I.  I took it up to read, that I might know under what influence my friends had fallen.  I became so much interested that I have spent all my spare time (often until midnight) reading, with my different translations of the Bible before me, comparing each of your references with the Book, etc. I have now finished VOL. III., and wish to express to you my appreciation of the truth you have brought to light.  While I do not see eye to eye with you in every minute detail, I can sincerely say that I have never before seen the beauty and harmony of the Word brought out in such clear and satisfying order.  Many of the thoughts you bring out have been shown me by the Spirit; but what I most appreciate in your book is the clear and orderly arrangement of those things of which I have had glimpses.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Two great truths which you bring out are--in the way you handle them--entirely new to me; viz., First, Restitution in the Millennial age.  I have clearly seen that &quot;old School&quot; teachings limited the ransom of Jesus Christ, but never until now have I seen restitution presented in what seemed to me a Scriptural and logical manner.  I am filled with great joy, as I now contemplate this precious truth.  God's plan is certainly much larger than theology (?).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The second great truth greatly surprises me: that Christ has come is a most astonishing statement.  I cannot yet fully take it in.  For years I have fully believed, taught and preached his coming in person; but I have always thought it would be in the flesh; although I have believed that only the Bride would know.  But now I admit the truth you advance: that his coming must be as a Spirit being.  Is not that included in the divine order--first the natural, then the spiritual?  My earnest cry has been, &quot;Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!&quot; I believed the time had come for that cry. Is it possible that, instead of that, I am to cry, &quot;Behold the Bridegroom?&quot;  I am seeking</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1631 : page 79::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">light on this one point; for surely, if that be true, there is no time for God's messengers to tarry in the harvest work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, Brother, I thank God for all the truth he has given you to give out to us.  I have been preaching the gospel to the best</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1631 : page 80::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of my light for seventeen years (I am now almost an old man).  For the past year I have not been in active gospel work; but, singularly, just as I have been brought to read your writings, I am asked to go forth again to give out the Word of God.  For years I have been out of &quot;Babylon,&quot; and of necessity my work must be among the humble and poor, and those who are hungry for the Word.  I go where he calls. During the past ten years I have built two chapels and gathered two congregations; but now it seems to me there is time only to call out--not to build and gather.  May he, the Lord of the Harvest, guide me, is my earnest prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">May God bless thee, and use thee more and more to give out the truth.</font><br />

I did not have time to read it, but was so much interested that I sent for the three volumes.  I have just completed the third volume: it has been to me like a shower in a desert.  I am thirsty and hungering for more.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">For ten years, while living on a homestead, I read my Bible in the Orthodox way, and prayed to and trusted in God; yet something kept me out of the denominations.  I was not satisfied to subscribe to any creed. On coming to the city, I resolved to unite with some church and Sunday School, and become an active worker; but, after visiting all of the Protestant denominations, I found so much unchristlike behavior, that I could not join any of them.  The past year I have awakened from the indifference into which I had settled, and have been in a small way trying to get at the truth; and now I feel as if I wanted to engage in some way in this harvest work.  Please send me all the information you can.                   J. HAWLEY.</font><br />

My aged mother and myself have been for years students of the Word, and lovers of the Lord's appearing, and our minds were prepared to receive the fuller light which the DAWNS shed forth. The Word becomes more and more a source of light and delight; and, as we see more deeply into that wonderful plan, we are amazed at the infinite love, wisdom, power and justice of our God; and yet, we ask, why this amazement?  For it is just like God. The trouble was, we have been worshiping something that was not God.  May God help each one of his children to be diligent in making the truth and his true character.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The well-known enmity of the papists toward this society gives color to the statement made yesterday by a prominent Mason, that all who belong to that or any other Protestant order are doomed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">[Then follows the first list of seven prominent Masons, with no doubt appropriate statements of their moral worth, and mental and physical qualifications fitting them for their respective offices.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Beyond doubt Mayor Hopkins intends to cut out every member of the society now in the city's employ.  Nothing has been done openly, but the quiet tip has gone around that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Mason may expect his discharge.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The mayor has no reason for discharging members of any secret society, except that they are of necessity Protestant.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;There is danger of offence, danger of apostasy. Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall!  Never was it more important that a Christian should be Christlike. Before God, I think that we are to follow our Lord through a dark valley, and to drink a bitter cup.  There is a mighty movement toward the consummation of all unbelief and opposition to the Lord's Anointed: a movement long ago forewarned, yet none the less terrible as it sweeps over Christian lands.  We see many wise, mighty and learned fascinated with its falsehood, and giving to it the weight of their influence and genius.  But we wait-- 'how long, O Lord, how long!'--for the day when the lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted.  For 'I know that my Redeemer liveth; and that I shall stand in the latter day upon the earth; whom I shall see for myself; and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.'&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   After our last Summer's Convention at Chicago had adjourned, and only about sixty of the friends remained, mostly colporteurs, Brother Witter took a Cabinet photograph of all in a group.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He has supplied a copy free to all the colporteurs known to desire them and has donated a quantity to the Tract Fund.  These we now offer to any who may desire them at fifty cents per copy.  The receipts will go to forward the general work.</font><br />
