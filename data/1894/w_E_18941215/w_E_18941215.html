<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;WHO SHALL ASCEND.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?  He that hath clean hands and a pure heart: who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.  He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.  This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek the face of the God of Jacob.&quot;--`Psa. 24:3-6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">IN this psalm the prophet David takes the standpoint of the dawn of the Millennial age, when, after the great time of trouble, the kingdoms of this world will have become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ (`Rev. 11:15`), --when the &quot;Times of the Gentiles&quot; will have been fulfilled, and &quot;he whose right it is&quot; will have taken unto him his great power and begun his glorious reign.  Those who have studied the plan of the ages and its times and seasons know that this is due to be accomplished by the year 1915,--only twenty years future from the present time.  Then will the words of this prophecy be fulfilled--&quot;The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; for he hath founded it upon [instead of] the seas, and established it upon [in place of] the floods.&quot;--`Verses 1,2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The earth, the world, the seas and the floods, the hills and the mountains are all used here, as in numerous other instances, in a symbolic, and not in a literal sense, which would be absurd in this connection.  The earth and the world represent the present social order of things, or human society as at present organized.  The seas and the floods represent an increasingly large class of mankind which restlessly recoils against the restraints of the present social order and at times grows turbulent and threatening. The hills and mountains represent governments.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, it will not be because all the kingdoms of this world will have been converted to God and purified, and their kings permitted to reign by the grace of God, as they now claim to do, and because all the now restless masses of men will have become docile and submissive to the present governing powers; but it will be as the prophet declares, because God will have &quot;founded it upon the seas and established it upon the floods.&quot;  That is, the present earth, or social organization, and the present heavens, or ruling powers, will have passed away, and the new earth will be established upon the ruins of the old. When the waves of the restless sea-element of society shall have arisen in their might and overwhelmed the whole present social order, so that the wild and stormy sea of anarchy shall prevail everywhere, then, amidst the wreck and ruin, the desolation and universal despondency and despair, the voice of Jehovah will be heard, saying, &quot;Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.&quot; (`Psa. 46:10`.)  And out of the wild commotion of that stormy sea God will bring order and peace.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Instead of this restless sea of humanity he will found the new earth, the new order of things; yea, and he will firmly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">establish it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> upon [in place of] the floods: there he will establish his Kingdom &quot;which cannot be moved.&quot; (`Heb. 12:28`.) And he will set his King upon his holy hill of Zion, and give to him the nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1744 : page 388::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">his possession. (`Psa. 2:6,8`.)  Then indeed shall the King, the Lord's anointed, reign in righteousness; and princes shall decree justice (`Isa. 32:1`); and, in consequence, there shall be abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. --`Psa. 72:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There will then be but one Kingdom (mountain or hill) in all the world--the Kingdom of God; and his Anointed will be King in all the earth in that day. (`Zech. 14:9`.)  This hill or kingdom of the Lord is that to which the Psalmist refers when he raises the question, &quot;Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place?&quot;  To ascend into the hill of the Lord is to come into his Kingdom as loyal and obedient subjects, as true citizens, worthy of all its blessings and privileges, and not as aliens and foreigners, having no part or lot in the common interests and inheritance of all the true and loyal people of God, viz., eternal life and all its blessings of righteousness, peace and everlasting joy.  Who indeed shall be counted worthy thus to ascend into the mountain of the Lord?  &quot;And who shall stand in his holy place?&quot;  The reference here is to the antitype of the typical temple of God, which, standing upon the top of Mount Zion, prefigured the glorious true temple, the Church of the living God, in Kingdom power and glory.  Who shall stand in that holy place in that age of glory and blessing now so near at hand?--who shall be counted worthy to reign with Christ in his Kingdom?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The answer to both inquiries is the same-- He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.&quot;  These will be the required qualifications for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">citizenship</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Kingdom, when the Kingdom is established; and they are also the qualifications required now of all those who would be heirs of that coming Kingdom. It will be observed that the qualifications mentioned are not those of faith (for faith in the gospel of the Kingdom, which includes faith in Christ the King and Redeemer, is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">implied</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the desire to be in the Kingdom in any capacity); but the qualifications mentioned here are those of character.  The Scriptures elsewhere make more specific mention of the necessary faith, but always implying a character consistent with the faith. (`Acts 16:31`; `John 3:16,36`.) The prophet does not ignore faith, but points to that character which is the legitimate consequence of a true faith exercised unto godliness. A faith which does not produce character is null and void. (`Jas. 2:17`.)  Therefore it is plain that both the heirs and the subjects of the Kingdom of God must have that character which is both begotten and developed by the faith of the gospel; for if the faith of the gospel be held in unrighteousness there is no place in the Kingdom for any such. (`Rom. 1:18`.) Let us consider the character-requirements here mentioned.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Clean hands.&quot;--That means clean actions, clean conduct.  If bad habits of any kind have been cultivated, they must be promptly forsaken. The hands must not be defiled with the holding of bribes, nor with the gain of oppression, and every evil thing must be resolutely put away. (`Isa. 33:15`.)  It is in vain that any profess loyalty to God and to his anointed King and Kingdom while they continue in a sinful course of action.  Loyalty to the Kingdom signifies determined opposition to sin in all its forms, and a firm resistance of it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A pure heart.&quot;--That signifies purity of will, intention or purpose, which, like the needle to the pole, always turns toward righteousness. Though some sudden or strong temptation may for an instant, through the weakness of the flesh, draw it to the right or to the left, yet quickly it recovers its normal position which is true to righteousness and truth.  A pure heart loves righteousness and truth, and hates iniquity. It loves purity, and despises all that is impure and unholy.  It loves cleanliness of person, of clothing, of language and of habits.  It delights only in the society of the pure, and shuns all others, knowing that &quot;evil communications corrupt good manners.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity.&quot; Pride is an abomination to the Lord and to all those who partake of his spirit.  It is a weed which, if once permitted to take root in the heart, will soon crowd out every grace. The Psalmist says, &quot;I hate vain thoughts;&quot; and such should be our sentiments.  The grace of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1744 : page 389::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">humility, meekness, is one of the most beautiful that can adorn the character.  It takes a sober estimate of personal qualifications, is not puffed up, does not behave unbecomingly, and seeks to exercise its talents, not for pride and vain glory, but for the joy of doing good.  It is modest, candid and sincere, both in consideration of its own qualifications and those of others. What comfort and pleasure are found in the society of those possessed of such a spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Nor sworn deceitfully.&quot;--Those who make a solemn covenant with the Lord, and who thereafter wilfully despise or ignore it, have sworn deceitfully; and surely no such disloyal subjects can be admitted either to citizenship or heirship in the Kingdom of God.  But those who, in this age, have made a solemn covenant with God and who are true to their covenant, even unto death, they shall ascend into the holy place, the temple of God--they shall be the heirs of the Kingdom, joint-heirs with Jesus Christ; while all such, in the age to come, shall be recognized and privileged citizens of the Kingdom. These shall receive the blessings of the Lord promised in his Word.  After first receiving the imputed righteousness of Christ through faith, they may, under divine grace, be made perfect in righteousness and worthy of eternal life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the generation of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob.  Men do not obtain these blessings without seeking them, nor without seeking them in God's appointed way-- through Christ, by humble reliance upon his finished work of redemption, and by the full consecration of all their ransomed powers of mind and body to his holy will, which is only our reasonable service.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Beloved, ye who are called by his grace to stand in his holy place, let us ponder these things.  Are our hands clean and our hearts pure? are we humble and faithful to our covenant? Let us see that we meet these conditions, and let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1744 : page 389::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THINK IT NOT STRANGE.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.&quot;--`1 Pet. 4:12,13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">PERHAPS few have learned to value the discipline of the Lord as did the faithful Apostle who wrote these words.  While he as well as others realized that no affliction for the present seemeth joyous, but rather grievous, yet knowing the ministry of such discipline, and recognizing it as an additional evidence of sonship to God, he rejoiced in being a partaker of it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But why is it that fiery trials must come to us?  Is there no way of gaining the crown without these crosses?  No, there is not; for if ye receive not the discipline of trial whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons; for what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not?  Trials of faith and patience and love and endurance are as necessary to our development and our fitting for the high position to which we are called, as are the instructions of the divine Word and the special manifestations of divine grace.  The blessed sunshine and shower have their benign influence, but none the less the cloud and the storm; but we need ever to bear in mind that the cloud has its silver lining, and that God is in the whirlwind and in the storm.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Like water upon the parched earth, and like sunshine to vegetation after winter snows, so the message of divine truth comes to us and with it the blessed realization of divine favor. In the joy of our new-found treasure we are apt to think at first that we have actually entered the Beulah land of joy and peace where sorrow and trial can never more come to us.  But no; there are sorrows ahead and trials beyond, and you will need all the strength which the truth can give and all the blessed influences that divine grace can impart to enable you to endure faithfully to the end.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But do not stop to worry about the trials until they come; only remember the Apostle's words--&quot;Think it not strange,&quot; when they do</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1744 : page 390::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">come.  They come to prove you and to strengthen your character and to cause the principles of truth and righteousness to take deep root in your heart.  They come like fiery darts from our great enemy, Satan, whose wrath against the children of light is permitted to manifest itself in various ways; but his darts cannot injure those who securely buckle on the divinely provided armor of truth and righteousness.  &quot;Wherefore,&quot; says the Apostle, &quot;take unto you the whole armor of God,...above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.&quot;-- `Eph. 6:13-17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Christian life is thus set forth as a warfare --a warfare, &quot;not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; (`Eph. 6:12`.) In other words, as Christians imbued with the spirit of our Master, we find the principles of truth and righteousness which we have espoused to be at variance with the whole present order of things, which is to a very large extent under the control of &quot;the prince of this world&quot; --Satan.  And when sin is thus so inwrought throughout the whole social fabric of the present age; and not only so, but when we also find the flesh, our own old nature, in harmony with it, we see into what close quarters we must come with the enemy, and what a hand to hand and life-long struggle it must needs be.  Yet our weapons are not carnal, but spiritual, and the Apostle says </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they are mighty</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the pulling down of the strongholds of error and iniquity. --`2 Cor. 10:4,5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When, therefore, the fiery trials and darts from the enemy come upon you, be ready as an armed soldier of the cross to meet and withstand them.  If you run away from them, you are a coward, and not worthy to be called a soldier.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1744 : page 390::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A THORN IN THE FLESH.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.  For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.  And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. &quot;Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then am I strong.&quot;--`2 Cor. 12:7-10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THIS was the language of an overcoming saint, meekly bowing to the divine will. Noble and loyal and true and strong in character as the Apostle Paul was, he yet realized that he was a member of the fallen race, and, in common with all humanity, subject to frailties. God had called him to a most important and glorious work--that of bearing the gospel to the Gentiles; and, for the benefit of the whole Church, to him were granted special and wonderful revelations, even above all the other honored and beloved apostles.  He was caught away in mental vision to the third heaven-- the new dispensation, the Millennial reign of Christ, and shown things (doubtless the plan and purpose of God, as now made manifest to us, largely through his writings, in the light of this harvest period, but) not lawful to be uttered then, because not then due to the Church. (`2 Cor. 12:4`.)  Upon him devolved the care of all the Churches of the Gentiles, and great were the responsibilities of his office.  Though the position was a most laborious and trying one, requiring great fortitude, zeal, energy and self-denial to fill it, it was also one of great honor.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And Paul appreciated the honor of such intimate fellowship of service with the Lord, and manifested his appreciation by untiring zeal and enthusiasm.  But even in this the Lord recognized a personal danger to his beloved and faithful Apostle--a danger of pride and self-exaltation, which, if it should develop, would soon unfit him for further service and rob him of his future reward.  So the thorn in the flesh was permitted to come.  It came, not from the hand of the Lord, though by his permission; but, as the Apostle affirms, it was &quot;the messenger of Satan to buffet&quot; him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1744 : page 391::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   A thorn in the flesh is always a painful thing; and whatever this may have been, it was something severely trying to Paul.  At first he thought only of the pain and annoyance it caused him, and of its hindrance to him in the Lord's work: it was a messenger of Satan that he was anxious to get rid of.  Three times he besought the Lord for its removal.  But no, it had come to stay, and the Lord mercifully made him to realize that though it was very undesirable to the flesh, it was nevertheless profitable to him spiritually; for otherwise he might become exalted overmuch.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The implication of weakness the Apostle humbly accepted.  He did not resent it and begin to boast of his strength and to reproach the Lord for not exerting his power for its removal; but, on the contrary, with grace and gladness he accepted the Lord's judgment of his heart, and his estimate of his strength, and appreciated the love that thus cared </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for him</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">personally,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while through him he was ministering to the whole Church.  Yes, praise the Lord! he chooses his own instruments, and whets and grinds and polishes them for the more effectual service, and wields them with force and power in the service of his people; but in all the painful and laborious service he has special care also for the willing and faithful instrument.  He will not suffer it to be tried beyond that which it is able to endure; nor will he suffer it to be exalted without some counterbalancing thorn in the flesh to preserve its equilibrium.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1745 : page 391::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The answer to the Apostle's prayer, although not in accordance with his request, was a blessed consolation--&quot;My grace [my favor] is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect [made manifest] in [your] weakness.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is also the blessed consolation of every truly submissive heart.  How many of the Lord's people are tempest-tossed and sorely tried in these days; and doubtless many of them have earnestly besought the Lord to remove this or that trial or affliction; but the piercing thorn still remains for their discipline and perfecting. Let all such, like Paul, give ear to the Master's voice--&quot;My favor is sufficient for thee.&quot;  What if other friends forsake thee, and hosts of foes seek to overwhelm thee, if thou hast my favor, my love: is not that sufficient?  And what though the flesh be weak and the heart sometimes faint, my strength shall supply your lack; and while you walk in the way of my appointment, your weakness shall only the more manifest the power of God working in and through you.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What sincere child of God has not realized, in times of greatest need and felt weakness, the power of God on his behalf supplementing his weakness with strength from above?  And when the task was accomplished to which the Lord had called him and for which he felt so incompetent of himself, has he not realized in the outcome the wonder-working power of God?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In view of such a gracious provision to supplement his weakness with divine strength, the faithful Apostle meekly responded, &quot;Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.&quot; Having put forth all his own energies and faithfully used his own ability to its fullest extent as a wise steward, it was his joy to recognize the hand of the Lord working with him--by miracles and signs and with demonstrations of the spirit and of power. (`Heb. 2:4`; `Acts 19:11`; `1 Cor. 2:4`.)  These demonstrations of divine power supplementing Paul's faithful use of his natural abilities were the Lord's endorsement of all he did--the manifestations of divine approval both to himself and to others, and consequently cause for great rejoicing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With the Apostle it is also the privilege of all God's children to have their weakness supplemented by divine grace, while they meekly and faithfully use their talents in the Lord's service. And so all the faithful may rejoice in tribulations and infirmities, while God overrules the former and supplements the latter to his praise.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But to rejoice in tribulations, to endure meekly and patiently a sore thorn in the flesh, and even to glory in such personal infirmities as make the power of Christ the more manifest, is not possible except to those whose hearts are in fullest accord with the loving purposes of God.  If the heart be influenced by pride or ambition or love of fame or wealth or any worldly ambition, joy in tribulation is impossible. But if the old ambitions and desires of the flesh are kept under, and faith, love, hope and zeal are all alive and active, we shall have the consciousness of the divine favor, and then we can rejoice in every experience.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Lord is my Shepherd: I shall not want.&quot;--`Psa. 23:1`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">IN comparing himself to a shepherd, the Lord made a very apt illustration of his care for his people--a care which is always solicitous for their welfare, watchful for their interests, patient with their youth and inexperience and untiring in its ministry of love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But it is only when the individual can say in his heart, The Lord is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">my</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Shepherd, that this blessed ministry of the good Shepherd can be realized.  It is when we become his sheep that we learn the value of the Shepherd's care; and the man who has had experience under the care of the good Shepherd can truly say with the Psalmist, &quot;I shall not want.&quot;  He shall not want for the temporal necessities of the present life--&quot;Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.&quot; (`Isa. 33:16`; `Matt. 6:33,34`.) He shall not want for light and be left to walk in the darkness of this world, but unto him shall be given the light of life. (`John 8:12`.)  He shall not want the necessary care and discipline to fit him for the future life; &quot;for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.&quot; (`Heb. 12:6`.)  He shall not lack the consolations of divine grace in times of trial and affliction; for it is written, &quot;My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; (`2 Cor. 12:9`.) He shall not want for fellowship and sympathy; for the Lord himself hath said, &quot;I will never leave thee nor forsake thee&quot; (`Heb. 13:5`); and again, &quot;Lo, I am with you alway.&quot;--`Matt. 28:20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Surely no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly--as true sheep.  He will protect them in every danger, and guard them with a shepherd's care.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Z.W.T. TRACT SOCIETY'S ANNUAL REPORT.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">IT is with great pleasure, deep gratitude and profound recognition of the great Master's providential leadings, that we summarize and lay before our readers the results of their labors and ours with and under the great Chief Reaper in the present harvest work, for the past year-- from Dec. 1, 1893 to Dec. 1, 1894.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We congratulate our readers that although the year has been marked by Satan's fiercest assaults upon the Lord's work and upon us of the WATCH TOWER as his and your representatives in the supervision of that work,--and notwithstanding, too, the fact that the year has been one of unprecedented pinch in financial affairs, nevertheless it has been the most successful year of the Tract Society's experience in the amount of money received and expended, and in the tract pages circulated, as you will see from the reports of the Secretary and Treasurer subjoined.  True, the work is small:--very small is the sum at our disposal for the spread of the Truth compared with the immense sums donated to other tract societies for the promulgation of what we believe to be chiefly error.  The Lord in his wisdom has seen fit to limit the means at our disposal, and no doubt for good reasons;--quite probably to draw out to greater activity and self-denial each one who has the cause at heart.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It is required of a steward that he be found faithful.&quot;  We at the WATCH TOWER office are in several respects stewards of the Lord's goods, &quot;stewards of the manifold grace of God,&quot; and it is his approval which we crave.  We trust that as he reviews the efforts and results of the year--your efforts and ours--that he can approve both you and us, saying, &quot;Well done, good, faithful servants.&quot;  But we of the TOWER office are not only the Lord's stewards, of goods both temporal and spiritual, but we are also your stewards,--stewards of those monies which you have contributed to the Tract Fund--and as your stewards this report is due to you, and submitted accordingly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If we cannot congratulate you that the sum is a large one, we can congratulate you that it has accomplished more than double as much as the same amount generally accomplishes in the hands of other Tract Societies, where</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1745 : page 393::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">salaries and office rent consume a large proportion of the receipts.  Twenty-three millions of pages of tracts is a good showing; and if the DAWN pages circulated were added, it would represent over thirty millions of pages more. Thank God for the privilege of having a share in this, his work of gathering together his elect unto him, preparatory to the setting up of his Kingdom in power and great glory.  Compare `Psa. 50:4,5`; `Matt. 13:30`, and `Matt. 24:31`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The colporteur work has been considerably interfered with by reason of the financial depression. Tens of thousands of people who have the time to read, and whose minds are more than ever open to the message of God's Kingdom coming, have been obliged by necessity to refuse to purchase DAWNS, and have been supplied with free tracts instead.  This in turn has worked unfavorably to the colporteurs, many of whom have been obliged to receive credits and some assistance from the Tract Fund while others have been forced to quit the work entirely until times improve, which we expect will not be before next Spring.  These dear co-laborers have many trials and discouragements by the way, and need our prayers.  Let all who feel an interest in the cause remember in their devotions these whose labor of love has been God's instrumentality for carrying the good tidings of great joy to so many of you, and this branch of the service, which has been specially attacked by the Adversary during the year just closed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Impressed with the fact that a number of school teachers, ministers and business men who had tried the colporteur work had failed to make it a success, we have devised a new method of work specially suitable for them.  A few are already using it with success, and we hope that it will enable many to engage in the harvest work in a self-supporting way during the coming year.  The new method is not at all adapted to the use of the average colporteur, who succeeds best with the usual methods: indeed the new method is suited only to those who by the grace of God can respond that they possess the eight qualifications for public ministry,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1746 : page 393::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">mentioned in our issue of Sept. 1; and it is consequently explained </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only to such as can and do</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thus respond.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;New Branch of Service,&quot; started some time ago, but mentioned and enlarged recently, --viz., the arrangement for the holding of meetings, by traveling representatives of the Tract Society--is proving spiritually profitable to the Church, as indicated by letters received from various quarters, which tell of spiritual good derived, and truth more clearly discerned.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This work is carried on economically, too, that the means supplied by the Lord may reach as far and accomplish as much as possible.  A reference to the Treasurer's report will show that only $403.88 has been expended in this way; and this was nearly all spent during the past three months.  Brother M. L. McPhail only has been giving all of his time to this work, and he alone has all of his expenses paid out of the Tract Society's fund, the other laborers in this branch of the service, Brothers Antoszewski, Austin, Bell, Blundin, Bohnet, Draper, Merrill, Murphy, Owen, Page, Ransom, Richards, Thorn, Webb, Weber, Weimar, West, Williams, Wise and Witter, being traveling salesmen, colporteurs or business men whose expenses are met by their business or otherwise and who delight to give an evening or a Sunday, as they can arrange it, in serving the Lord's flock--pointing to the green pastures and the still waters and feeding and rejoicing with the &quot;sheep.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">During the past five months Brother McPhail has visited groups of WATCH TOWER readers in fifty-three cities, and has held about one hundred and fifteen meetings in the states of Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.  The other brethren, all together, have probably held as many more meetings--some in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Massachusetts, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana, Canada, Illinois, Texas, California, Oregon and Florida.  Several others expect to engage in this branch of the work early next year.  This branch of the service also deserves our sympathies, co-operation and prayers. The blessings attending these meetings will depend largely upon the sympathy and cooperation of those visited; and the Lord will not be unmindful of your labor of love and</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1746 : page 394::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">service in such co-operation, in however humble the capacity; and he will reward with grace now and with glory hereafter.  All who desire such meetings, and who would co-operate in making them a blessing to themselves and others, are invited to let us know of their desires.  And any who make use of the &quot;Good Hopes&quot; blanks which accompany this issue may, if they so prefer, designate what proportion of their donations they wish to have applied to the forwarding of this special branch of the service.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In view of the activity of our great Adversary, and his endeavor to counterfeit not only the light of truth, but also the ministers of the light, it is well that the Lord's people should be on guard against the agents of another gospel, which denies that our Lord </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them (`2 Pet. 2:1`) and claims that he was merely an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">teacher.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  No such error need be feared from any of the Brethren who bear our Letter of Introduction and Commendation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Concerning the spiritual condition of the Church in general, we have exceptionally good opportunities for judging, being in communication with many of the household of faith the world over; yet only the Lord can read the hearts;--&quot;the Lord knoweth them that are his.&quot;  However, we are glad to be able to report that while the love of many waxes cold, we have many cheering evidences that the spiritual warmth of others is constantly increasing; and although Satan is permitted to sift out some, as we were forewarned, others are by the same trial only the more firmly rooted and grounded and built up in the most holy faith.  And for every one who leaves the ransom and the light of present truth, another, more earnest and zealous, comes forward--reminding us of our Lord's words, &quot;Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.&quot;-- `Rev. 3:11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only do the letters received, and the reports from the traveling brethren and the colporteurs, testify to much earnestness and love for the truth, but the Treasurer's Report, which follows, testifies to the same in no uncertain tones; for where the poor give their hard-earned dollars their hearts must be also--especially in the recent close times.  While the sum contributed would be small indeed for wealthy people to spend in forwarding the grandest tidings that ever reached the ears of man, yet we know that the donations of some have not been without considerable self-denial; for among our readers are not many great or rich in this world's greatness and riches.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.&quot;--`Isa. 9:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The standpoint of the Prophet here is that of the dawn of the Millennial age, immediately after the setting up of the Kingdom of God in the earth--both its earthly and its heavenly phases.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verse 2`. &quot;The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light.&quot;  The reference here is to the world of mankind, all of whom will at that time recognize the presence of the Lord and his Kingdom established; for it is written that &quot;every eye shall see him.&quot; (`Rev. 1:7`.) The world that has walked in the darkness of ignorance and superstition for six thousand years will then begin to see the glorious light of truth and righteousness, and in the earthly phase of the Kingdom they will see the grand illustrations and rewards of righteousness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;They that dwell in the land of the shadow of death </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fleshly Israel under the condemnation of their law covenant*], a light shineth brightly over them.&quot;  Yes, the light will shine with special brilliancy upon fleshly Israel: then their blindness will be turned away and the favors of the new dispensation will again be--&quot;to the Jew first, and also [afterward] to the Gentile;&quot; and through the secondary instrumentality of the fleshly seed of Abraham shall all the nations of the world be blessed. The ancient worthies of that nation will be the visible rulers of the world, and their new work will begin at Jerusalem, bringing order out of confusion, peace out of discord and making Jerusalem a praise in the whole world.  It was with reference to this that the Prophet wrote again, saying, &quot;Arise, give light, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is shining forth</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">over thee.  For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and a gross darkness the people; but over thee the Lord will shine forth, and his glory will be seen over thee.  And nations shall walk by thy light, and kings by thy brightness of thy shining....And the sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; for in my wrath did I smite thee, but in my favor have I had mercy on thee.&quot;--`Isa. 60:1-3,10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verse 3`. &quot;Thou hast multiplied the nation [Israel--a reference to their gathering together again as a nation after the long dispersion of nearly two thousand years as fugitives among all the nations;--and also to their reinforcement by the resurrection of their ancient worthies and heroes], made great their joy: they rejoice before thee as with the joy in harvest, as men are glad when they divide the spoil.&quot; Such indeed will be the joy of Israel when the blessings of their restoration to divine favor begin to be realized.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verses 4,5`. &quot;For the yoke of their burden, and the staff on their shoulder, the rod of their oppressor [the heavy burdens of oppression imposed upon them and the persecutions inflicted by their Gentile enemies during the long period of their blindness and exile], hast thou broken, as on the day of Midian&quot;--when a great victory was won for them by Gideon's small band of 300 under the Lord's direction, without bloodshed and without strife. (`Judges 7:1-23`.) Even so shall it be when the Lord shall again fight for Israel: it will not be by their own power that the victory of the final battle will be secured.--See `Ezek. 38:11,15-23`. Also compare `verse 4` with `Ezek. 39:8-15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1747 : page 396::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   `Verse 6`. Why is all this return of divine favor to Israel? is it because of worthiness in them?  Surely not; for to this day they are a stiff-necked people, and their blindness and hardness of heart continue although we are within only a score of years of the time when all these things shall be fulfilled.  The reason for it is that the Lord hath remembered his covenant with their fathers (`Lev. 26:42,45`; `Jer. 31:34`), and that in fulfilment of that covenant a child has been born unto them who was destined to be a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of Israel; and now (at the time indicated in the prophecy) &quot;the government is placed upon his shoulders.&quot;  Dimly this light of the world shone upon Israel at the first advent of Messiah; but when &quot;the light shined in the darkness, the darkness comprehended it not.&quot;  &quot;He came unto his own, and his own received him not.&quot;  It is only at the second advent that they recognize him as the promised seed of Abraham and their long-looked-for Messiah.  They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and shall mourn for him.--`Zech. 12:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And his name is called Wonderful [What a wonder indeed to Israel specially, that the despised Nazarene, the man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, whom they hated and crucified and reviled, even to this day, was indeed their Messiah, and they knew him not. What a wonder, too, to them specially, will be the forgiving love that so meekly bore their reproaches and sacrificed even unto death to redeem them from the curse of the law, and that now returns to restore and bless them!  Wonderful, wonderful love, wonderful condescension and grace, and wonderful exaltation and glory and power!], Counsellor [not counsellor of the mighty God, as some translators have rendered it; for Paul significantly inquires concerning Jehovah, &quot;Who hath been his counsellor?&quot; (`Rom. 11:34`.)  He needed no counsellor, but poor fallen humanity does need such a wise counsellor, and he will teach them and they shall walk in his ways.--`Isa. 2:3`], The Mighty God [&quot;a Savior and a great one&quot;-- `Isa. 19:20`], The Everlasting Father [the new life-giver to our dead race--the second Adam --`1 Cor. 15:45`], The Prince of Peace [whose glorious reign shall be one of righteousness, bringing with it all the blessed fruits of righteousness --peace and joy and satisfaction and everlasting rest].&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Verse 7`. His dominion shall increase until all things are subdued under him.  It shall extend, not only to the ends of the earth, but eventually all things in heaven and in earth are to be united under his headship as the representative of Jehovah, who would have all men honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. --`Psa. 72:7`; `Eph. 1:10`; `John 5:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.&quot;  Such is Jehovah's purpose, and thus he declares that it shall be accomplished; and our hearts leap for joy as we realize, not only the glorious import of this prophecy, but also the fact that the time is at hand, and that a score of years future will see the Kingdom established and its blessings beginning to be experienced.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The common interpretation of this prophecy regards it as fulfilled upon Israel at the first advent, and the Kingdom of God as established then in the Gospel Church; and the great increase in the numbers and power of the nominal Church of all denominations, Papal and Protestant, as the predicted increase of Christ's government. --`Verse 7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Such a fulfilment would not be worthy of the record.  Christ does not reign in Christendom: its general character is antichristian.  The only sense in which Christ's kingdom was begun at the first advent was in its embryo condition; and this, the only true Kingdom of Christ in the world, has, like the Lord, been unrecognized in the world, except, like him, to be despised and forsaken and to suffer violence. Its numbers have always been small and its circumstances humble; for not many rich and great, etc., are called.--`1 Cor. 1:26-29`; `Jas. 2:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor did the nation of Israel at the first advent see or comprehend the light of Christ, nor did he at that time break their yoke or deliver them from the rod of their oppressor; for in consequence of their failure to recognize the light when it began to shine upon them, they were blinded, the rod of the oppressor came upon them with increased force and they have never yet been relieved, nor will they be until their Messiah is recognized as having come again, a second time; this time without a sin-offering unto salvation.--`Heb. 9:28`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us rejoice for them and for all mankind that the blessed day is nigh, even at the doors. Rightly viewed, this prophecy is full of rapturous inspiration.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--Of the books I brought with me to Denmark, there are now none left, and several Christian friends are anxiously waiting with me for the new lot to arrive.  The lady class leader of a large Methodist church, to whom I sold a copy of DAWN soon after coming here, has read a good part of it and has liked it so much that she is recommending it to S.S. teachers and pupils, and has sold several copies. People are not so prejudiced against it here, as some seemed to be in the United States.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a very lively place, and everybody looks happy and contented.  There are many churches.  The state church is Lutheran, a dead, formal thing, which, as intelligence increases, is losing more and more of its influence over the people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There has been much talk lately among the dissenters, Baptists, Methodists and others, concerning a church union.  A Mr. Edwards of England, one of the members of the S.S. committee in London, has been here several times, speaking in various churches upon the subject of joining all the Sunday Schools into one large body and using the &quot;International S.S. Lessons.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have attended three of these meetings, the last one being held in the Baptist church; and for the first time here ministers of various denominations were seen and heard from the same platform.  They seemed united to work their own scheme of &quot;saving the whole world&quot; before the Lord's Kingdom is set up.  Oh, how blind the guides! and the people are in gross darkness concerning the Lord's real, glorious plan. May his Kingdom soon come!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I would like very much to have a companion in the canvass, and am in hopes soon to get a young man, a clerk in a large book store, who is reading the DAWNS and likes them, to start out with me in the harvest work.  I have not regretted that I left America, but am well pleased here in every way.  I delight in doing some good work for the Lord, in finding and sealing his dear people, and feeding the truth-hungry with good meat from his table.  Truly it is a glorious work, when rightly understood and appreciated, and I thank the dear Lord for the opportunity of being used in it.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--I wish to ask a few questions in regard to some of the teachings in the WATCH TOWER and the Tracts.  Should not we who come out of Babylon have some organization?  [See TOWER, Sept. '93.]  What is the form of worship followed in your Allegheny Church?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have started a Bible class at our house. We meet with a few interested neighbors every Thursday evening.  Any suggestions as to what plan would be most conducive to our spiritual growth will be gladly considered. I do not want to take much of your valuable time.  If the questions within are of enough general interest to be treated in the TOWER, I shall not expect a personal answer to this letter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am in sympathy with the experiment of the TOWER Society in sending out teachers. May God be with the movement.  With Christian love from Sister Heston and myself, I am yours in his name,</font><br />

It took us a whole year to master VOL. I., there being so many points that required close and careful thought; but I think we were amply repaid for the course we adopted....</font><br />

The &quot;New Gospel&quot; expressed in Bishop Foster's sermon, however, may loosen their bonds somewhat, and they may follow their leader, even though they have heretofore resisted the plain truth.  The separating continues. &quot;Forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country,&quot; is being fulfilled in Babylon. The &quot;clouds of heaven&quot; are growing thicker, and must soon burst into the final great storm.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--I noticed in a recent TOWER the article on &quot;The New Branch of the Work,&quot; but had not thought of myself as having a clear enough knowledge of divine truth, or as being otherwise competent to fulfil the requirements.  However, I find that in some attempts to help others the Spirit of truth has greatly assisted me in bringing to my remembrance many truths of Scripture which I was not aware I had in my storehouse of memory.  I have also found that all such efforts to help others have always been of great benefit to myself; and now, after prayer and consultation with the Lord, I feel that perhaps I can be used by Him to some extent at least in strengthening some of the &quot;babes in Christ,&quot; by endeavoring to help them to a clearer understanding of God's wonderful plan.  It is only by the grace of God that I can say that the eight qualifications are applicable to me; but by his grace I hope to be able to meet these requirements, and so am glad to offer all the time at present at my disposal.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A recent Sunday I spend very pleasantly and profitably with a brother and his wife whom it was my privilege to interest in the truth. We spent the afternoon with relatives who have greatly opposed them in the new light, and with whom he has had long controversies, which, he now sees, have only hindered them instead of assisting them as he was anxious to do.  After considering the matter, I thought best to avoid all controversy, and seek to talk only on subjects on which we could agree, not missing opportunities to show forth the love of Christ and to impress them with the fact that we had been with Him.  The result was a very pleasant afternoon, and a cordial invitation to come again.</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER:--Christian love and greetings from me and mine to you and yours.  The &quot;transforming&quot; influence of the &quot;renewing of our minds&quot; draws us nearer in love to all who are probationary members of the Church, as well as to Jesus and those with him who have been changed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The work of preparing the Bride is wonderful, and the new plan of sending out Brethren to strengthen and help those who are striving seems very wise, though the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">risk</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is apparent.  From a little experience of our own it seems timely.  We have found that the lack of many is systematic Bible study.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a confirmation which you did not mention [See TOWER, Aug. 1, &quot;Is Death a Penalty or a Consequence?], as to Satan's power being exerted through various kinds of insect and other life, see `Luke 10:17-20` </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(Diaglott).</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  `Verse 19` reads, &quot;Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and on all that power which is of the enemy&quot;--showing that those injurious creatures are counted part of his power.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In our reading my wife and I came across the best proof we have yet found that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;remnants&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the so-called &quot;ten lost tribes&quot; were really in Palestine.  Paul, in his speech before Agrippa, says, &quot;And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God to our fathers; unto which promise our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">twelve tribes,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instantly serving God day and night, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hope to come.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Acts 26:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our daily prayer is for you and Sister Russell and those associated with you, that you may indeed be led of the holy Spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yours in the love of Christ,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                      CHARLES C. BELL.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   GENTLEMEN:--I have recently received two or three tracts from you, one of which, entitled &quot;Do You Know,&quot; is of a character to command my attention and enlist my confidence. Your liberal attitude and anti-sectarian spirit, with your advanced Scriptural declarations, commend your publications sufficiently to induce me to seek a more intimate acquaintance with your Society and from what you assert in relation to the book, MILLENNIAL DAWN, I am induced to send for it; and, as the price is not given, I enclose one dollar, and you can send me anything that you consider &quot;meat in due season.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am poor in spirit and purse, but rich in faith--looking for the coming of Jesus Christ, the King of kings, and loving his appearing.  I belong to no sectarian organization: if a member of the Church, it is the one that fled into the wilderness from the face of the serpent, the only door to which is Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If your Society publishes a serial, send me a number.  I will endeavor to help sustain every means of grace that seems to accord with Bible truth and &quot;the faith once delivered to the saints.&quot;         C. D. M__________.</font><br />
