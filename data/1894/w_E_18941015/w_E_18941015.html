<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">BISHOP FOSTER'S NEW GOSPEL, NO. 2.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">WE do not find fault with the Bishop's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sympathy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for heathendom, nor with his rebellion against an injustice which would consign them to an eternity of woe, mental or physical. Nay, we rejoice that he can see that such procedure is so unjust that it cannot possibly be the truth: it cannot possibly be God's plan. We rejoice that the Bishop is so free from the errors of Calvinism that he cannot believe that the 1,200,000,000 of heathen now living, and the fifty times that number who have died without the knowledge of the only name given under heaven and among men whereby they can be saved, were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">predestinated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by God to their present ignorance and to an eternity of woe hereafter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We rejoice also that he has gotten free from the idea of his own Church, viz., that the power of God for the help of the heathen is confined to this present life and to the present missionary efforts of his children, and that the vast multitudes not so reached and blessed will suffer untold agonies to all eternity;--not because God predestinated that it should be so, but because God and his faithful people are doing all they can for the poor heathen, and can do no more.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All this indicates a breadth and freedom of thought and a sympathy of heart on the part of the Bishop which we greatly appreciate.  But we fear for the Bishop and for his flock, because </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> freedom and sympathy are not begotten by the teachings of God's Word.  His lengths and</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1717 : page 323::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">breadths, and heights and depths of good desire for the heathen are not those inspired by God's revelation of his plan.  Consequently, the more the Bishop and his followers progress upon these lines, the farther they will get from the true plan of the ages--the lengths and breadths, the heights and depths of the love of God, which surpasses human understanding.-- `Rom. 11:33-36`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This tendency to depart from God's Word is markedly manifested in other parts of the same discourse, and cannot fail to lead many of the &quot;blind&quot; &quot;into the ditch.&quot;--`Matt. 15:14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For instance, we quote as follows from the report of the same discourse, as it appeared in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pittsburg Commercial Gazette.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Why did not Christ come immediately after the fall of man?  Why was not Revelation made at once?  Simply because it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could not be.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">... In Eden language </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">took form,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but it was not sufficient for Revelation.  Adam probably knew very little, and God treated him accordingly. He did not give him such a law as he gave to Israel at Sinai, but he treated him as you would an infant.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here we see the effect of the Evolution theory, in which the Bishop is evidently a believer. Since that theory is the very opposite of the Bible theory, conflicts at every point are unavoidable. The Bishop looks at our civilization, then backward along the aisles of history, noting the ignorance of the past upon every subject. He, with all others who lose confidence in the Bible, jumps to the conclusion that Adam was an infant, with whom language </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">began</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to take form.  He, however, states the matter </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> agreeably and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Scripturally than to say that</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1717 : page 324::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Adam was an ape of a high order of development, and that in him the ape chatter began to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">take form,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or to become a language.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bishop is right in supposing that his words were more acceptable to his hearers than if he had put the matter bluntly, as Darwin and others have done.  The Bishop's language, however, is the more dangerous; for it sugar-coats the doctrine and hides its true unscriptural character from some of God's children who would resent, as unscriptural, the idea that Adam was an ape and that his race has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;fallen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">upward&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the past six thousand years.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Scriptural position, briefly stated, is that God, instead of creating Adam down at or near the brute level, created him in his own image and likeness, and pronounced him, Very good! God does not, however, pronounce the natural man of to-day, Very good.  On the contrary, he declares that all have sinned; all are out of the way; all are fallen; there is none righteous, no, not one; and that only under cover of the imputed righteousness of Christ can any be acceptable with God or have communion with him.  But Adam had fellowship and communion with God and was called his &quot;son&quot; (`Luke 3:38`), up to the time of his transgression and sentence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bishop says that Adam's knowledge of language was so crude that God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> then make a Revelation.  The Scriptures tell us, to the contrary, that God did make revelations to Adam--&quot;talked with him&quot; (`Gen. 1:28-30`; `2:15-17,23`; `3:8-20`);--but God does not deign to communicate at all with the modern man, except he become a &quot;believer&quot; in Christ.  The flood of Noah's day has left no traces of the early civilization, so far as is now known; but we may safely suppose that the man whom God called a very good man and declared to be in his own image--the man who could talk with God and with his wife, and who could not only name the animals, but control them, and that without brute force, was such a specimen of human nature as we do not see to-day.  It does not follow that they had a written language in Adam's day, or that they printed books or had the law written upon tables of stone.  Perhaps they had conditions which were preferable.  Perhaps they had means of communicating thoughts without writing and printing.  We believe they had.  The necessity for written language may (we believe does) lie in the fact that Adam's race has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fallen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the original, perfect state in which he was created.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our present dependence upon language and books, etc., and the consequent development of these to meet our necessities, may be illustrated as follows: Suppose that a racial weakness of the ankles had set in as the result of the fall, so that none were able to walk without crutches.  The crutches at first introduced would probably be very clumsy; but, as time progressed, the shapes and finish and ornamentation of articles so useful would surely progress also.  Then men unguided by the Scriptures would probably philosophise thus: &quot;See how crude, compared with ours, were the crutches in use a few centuries ago;--Adam probably lay around unable to walk at all, or merely crawled about, pulling himself by the roots and branches of trees and bushes.  The Bishop, philosophising from the same standpoint of thought, might have changed the expression above and said, &quot;Why did not Christ come immediately after the fall of man?  Simply because it was in Eden that locomotion began, and that in a crude form of crawling.  The helps or crutches of that time would not have been sufficient to enable him to go about to preach the gospel.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Language and books are merely the crutches which partially make good the defects of the human mental powers incident to the fall-- lack of mental perception and lack of memory. Does anyone suppose that in heaven God and the angels are dependent solely upon spoken and written language, books, etc., that some of the angels are printers, and others binders? Neither should we suppose that the perfect man needed such helps or crutches, but that these developed to meet his wants, and that as those wants or imperfections of man disappear during the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">times of restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets-- these will be unnecessary. (`Acts 3:19-21`.)  Undoubtedly, however, language and books will continue among men even after the powers of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1717 : page 325::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mental discernment and expression</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have been restored to them during the Millennium.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In full harmony with this is the promise of the Lord--&quot;This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord: I will put my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">laws</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.&quot; (`Heb. 8:10`; `10:16`.)  Here the law written upon tables of stone, and given at Sinai, under the typical Covenant, is contrasted with the better arrangement of the New Covenant, which will ignore a written language entirely and write upon the hearts. The context shows that when the law has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thus</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> written upon the hearts of all antitypical Israelites, who make this New Covenant with the Lord through Christ, there will no longer be any teaching, for none will be ignorant of the Lord. --`Jer. 31:33,34`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And this condition, which is to be ushered in by the Millennial age or &quot;times of restitution,&quot; will correspond exactly to the conditions previous to the fall.  The law to Adam was not in book form, nor upon tables of stone, but infinitely better: it was written in his heart and brain--in his very nature.  He knew right from wrong by the operation of his perfect brain.  Being &quot;very good,&quot; a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">likeness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his Creator, he needed no reminders as to God's will.  And the law given at Sinai twenty-five centuries later, instead of being a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">higher</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> expression of the divine will, was a very much </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inferior</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> expression, when compared with the perfect mind-and-heart-written law bestowed upon Adam.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle Paul corroborates all this, and tells us that all men have some traces of this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">original</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and superior law.  Referring to some of the most degraded members of the race, he says, these &quot;show the work [evidences] of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">law written in their hearts.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 2:15`.) And in the preceding chapter the Apostle shows how it comes that some of the heathen are so very much more degraded than others,--how the original nature-written law came to be so much more nearly effaced from the hearts and brains of some of earth's families or races than from others.  &quot;Because that, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">when they knew</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God [in the remote past], they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools;...wherefore, God gave them up to uncleanness....And even as they did not like [prefer] to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">retain God in their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God gave them over to a reprobate mind.&quot;--`Rom. 1:21,22,24,25,28`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle's explanation of present degradation is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fall down</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from a height; a failure to retain God in their knowledge--an effacing of the law from their hearts and minds.  The Bishop, on the contrary, teaches that the race begun in the infant Adam, one degree above an ape, had not, previous to the coming of Christ, progressed sufficiently to be able to receive a revelation from God,--human language until then being too imperfect.  Which is right? the inspired Apostle or the Bishop?  Evidently the worldly-wise theory of the latter respecting Evolution is hindering his study of and faith in the Scriptures.  But we must accept the consistent theory of the Scriptures, though it separate us entirely from the philosophies of the worldly-wise.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In speaking of the cause of Adam's ejection from Eden, the Bishop </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">says</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;fall;&quot; but what does he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mean?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Evidently, from the general tenor of his discourse, he means that Adam and his race have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;falling upward&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for six thousand years.  The &quot;infant&quot; Adam, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> degree superior to an ape, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fell up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the present civilized </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hood;--as the result of disobedience to God's commands!  Surely any who believe this gospel would be justified in saying, Let us do evil that good may follow!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prove</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Bishop's words by Scripture, and who seek &quot;to the law and the testimony,&quot; will turn from such inconsistency</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1718 : page 325::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of human reasoning.  Such would ask the Bishop, Where then would be the room for, or necessity, or value of, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all, given by our Redeemer?  From </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">what</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeem</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men, if Adam's course were so beneficial?  And why should the promise of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (restoring to Adam's condition) be held out by God at the mouth of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all the holy prophets?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Acts 3:21`.) Surely, restitution of even semi-civilized peoples to a babe condition, one degree above the ape, would be a curse, a retrogression, an injury, a most undesirable thing!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1718 : page 326::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   One error leads naturally to another: consequently we find the following unscriptural statement in the same discourse.  The Bishop is reported to have said:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We think sin caused death, and we are accustomed to say so.  It is not true!  Death is God's normal method of the universe!  God made the universe for death!&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The vast majority of Christian professors would agree with the Bishop, and could scarcely tell </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">why</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they sometimes have associated death with sin; when they knew all the time that they recognized no relationship.  We suggest a reason for this.  It is because they sometimes read the Bible, and they find it thus stated therein. But as they get to believe that the race is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">falling</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that the Bible was written by well-meaning men </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">far down</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> below present development --by men who never saw an electric car or a bicycle or a telephone--they will get to have less and less care for what the Bible says upon this or any subject.  But let us examine the Bible and note how positively it contradicts the Bishop --or, as the Bible existed first, we should say, how positively the Bishop's expression contradicts the Bible.  It says:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The soul that sinneth, it shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- `Ezek. 18:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The wages of sin is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Rom. 6:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;By one man's disobedience sin entered into the world, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by [or as a result of] sin.&quot;--`Rom. 5:12`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;By one man's offense </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reigned.&quot;-- `Rom. 5:17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;By the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation [to the wages of sin, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death].&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Rom. 5:18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Sin hath reigned unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Rom. 5:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Since by man [Adam] came </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- `1 Cor. 15:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;In Adam all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`1 Cor. 15:22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The sting of [or which produces] </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is sin.&quot;--`1 Cor. 15:56`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Jas. 1:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In harmony with these words of the apostles and prophets was the declaration of God to Adam when he placed him upon trial, in Eden, &quot;In the day [`2 Pet. 3:8`] that thou eatest thereof, dying, thou shalt </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as expressed by Eve,--&quot;God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> It was Satan that declared, &quot;Ye shall not surely </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the result of transgressing God's command.  How strange that the Bishop and so many others place themselves on the side of Satan and join in his contradiction of God's declaration, and with him join in deceiving mankind respecting &quot;the wages of sin.&quot;--`Gen. 2:17`; `3:3,4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Bishop's confusion respecting the heathen millions is largely because he fails to see clearly the Bible doctrine of the fall of Adam into condemnation of death, and that the terrible ravages of death (with its attendant features, sickness and pain) which for six thousand years have rested so heavily upon the race are God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;curse&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the &quot;wages&quot; or penalty for sin.  Failing to see that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hades,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the grave, is the penalty for sin, and an awfully severe, though just, penalty, the Bishop and millions of others have for years looked for and imagined a place where devils will riot in pleasure to all eternity, enjoying the torments they will, by God's will and providence, or by his inability to prevent, inflict upon billions of the human race.  Having misconceived the meaning of the words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheol</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hades,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> rendered &quot;hell&quot; in our common version Bible (Can we really </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">excuse</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an educated man on the score of ignorance as to the meaning and Scriptural use of these words?), and having outgrown the unscriptural eternal torment theories, the Bishop is wandering about looking amongst the most </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fallen-up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> men for some modern theory that will prove that death, and pain and sickness are blessings, and that the heathen as well as the saints enter by this gateway into a heaven where the few developed Christians will be perfectly happy, surrounded by myriads of characterless heathen, idiots, etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If the Bishop would find </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the path of life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which God has provided, for there is no other, let him retrace his steps; let him acknowledge that God created man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">upright,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but that he sought out various contrary devices and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">defiled himself.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Eccl. 7:29`.)  Then let him admit the fall of man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">downward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--mentally, morally and physically. Then he will find a place for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for all--Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--to redeem man from</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1718 : page 327::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sentence of death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then he will find a place for the restitution to their &quot;former estate&quot; of human perfection of all who will receive Christ and obey him. (`Acts 3:19-21`; `Ezek. 16:48-63`.) Then he will find a use for the Bible doctrine of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the dead, which would be an absurdity if there be none dead.  Then the Lord's promise that &quot;All that are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in their graves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall hear the voice of the Son of Man and come forth,&quot; will have a meaning (`John 5:25-29`); and soon he will see that the hope for the heathen of foreign lands, living and dead, and the only hope for the vast majority of civilized lands, will be the great Kingdom of Christ during the Millennium, for which we were taught to pray, &quot;Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven;&quot;--a prayer not yet answered.  And in connection he will find that the Church is the &quot;little flock&quot; to which it is the Heavenly Father's good pleasure to give this Kingdom--in association with Christ her Head and Bridegroom;--that the Kingdom cannot come until the Church has been completed,--and that not until then can &quot;all the families of the earth be blest&quot; with the promised Millennial blessings and opportunities. --`Luke 12:32`; `Rev. 20:4`; `Gen. 28:14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One more point before we close.  We quote again from the report of the same sermon:--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">GOD FORCING MEN TO SIN.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;God gives </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impulses</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to reach out and take that which we should not have.  But when, to indulge these desires, we step over the law with which he has hedged us about, we commit sin.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Here the Bishop is driven by the other errors he holds to this almost blasphemous statement that God not only places temptations before men, but that he actually impels or forces them to do sin; for this is the significance of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;impulse.&quot;  Webster</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> defines it, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;impelling,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">or driving onward.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  To say that God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impels</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impulses</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">drives</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mankind to choose &quot;that which we should not have,&quot; and then &quot;hedges us about&quot; with contrary commands so as to entrap us in sin, would be to give him the character which properly applies to Satan.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If at the time of his trial Adam was ignorant of right and wrong, or if God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impelled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him to do the sin, surely that was not a fair trial.  And to so teach is to declare God unjust, not only as to the trial, but still more so in respect to the punishment inflicted because of that failure --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> including all sickness, pain and trouble. This view would make God the great and really the only sinner, his penalty a sham, and the Bible doctrine of man's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redemption</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the precious blood of Christ a farce; for if man did not do the sinning, he was not guilty and needed no redemption, and God, who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impulsed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impelled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an imperfect creature to sin, was alone blameworthy, properly deserving of punishment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But how inconsistent all this is when compared with the simple account--the only inspired account. The Bible shows Adam &quot;upright,&quot; &quot;very good&quot; in God's sight, an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;image</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God&quot; in flesh.  It shows his fair trial, his just sentence, God's sympathetic love for his creature, even in his fallen condition, and his abundant provision for him in the gift of his Son for his redemption and restitution.  The Bible theory is consistent with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reason:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> other theories are not so.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How clearly the Scriptures contradict the Bishop, saying, &quot;Let no man say, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil; neither tempteth he any man.&quot;--`Jas. 1:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the Bishop's argument appears in a still worse light when its different parts are united. For instance, take the suggestion that Adam was an inexperienced &quot;infant,&quot; with whom language only began to take </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and was &quot;insufficient for revelation;&quot; add to this the statement that God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impulsed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">impelled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him to take the forbidden fruit and thus to break his laws; add, thirdly, the proposition that God falsified to the &quot;babe&quot; Adam, and told him that he would </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for his disobedience, while he really meant no such thing (for the Bishop says, sin did not cause death: &quot;Death is the normal [regular, proper] method of the universe&quot;), but intended thus to develop humanity and bring it up to perfection.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Can any one imagine a more nauseating theological compound than this?  Verily, as the Lord foretold through the prophet, &quot;The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1718 : page 328::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">hid.&quot;--`Isa. 29:14`.  Read also `verses 9-13`, applicable at the present time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Such teaching, from such a high dignitary, in so popular a church as the Methodist, is sure to have much bad fruit, and that quickly, in the ranks of the ministers, as well as amongst the &quot;laity.&quot;  Indeed, we were not surprised to learn that within two weeks after this discourse by the Bishop, an M.E. pastor in our city</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1719 : page 328::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">preached about Adam being a big, ignorant baby, and that his temptation and fall were necessary in order to develop him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How needful that God's people see the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to keep them from following such blind guides and stumbling into the pit of unbelief and agnosticism! Those whose eyes have been anointed by the eye-salve of truth, and who now see the real beauty and harmony of God's Word, should not be satisfied to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rest</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the truth and to render thanks therefor.  They should &quot;preach the Word,&quot; the gospel of salvation by the cross and not by a fall upward (evolution), nor as a reward for ignorance.  Those who do not get the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> speedily, will get the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">error;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for Satan's time is short and his deceptive theories are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">many,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while the truth is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A sure way to test all theories is to square them by the doctrine of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Every theory which asserts that Adam did not fall from perfection of life into death, or which says or implies that his fall and that of his race has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">upward,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> denies the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whether its advocates so admit or not; for, if nothing was lost, nothing could be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeemed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or bought back.  If it denies that man's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life was forfeited</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by sin, it cannot claim the sacrifice of Christ's life as &quot;a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [a corresponding PRICE] for all.&quot;  If </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be the normal or proper condition, and not the wages of sin, then Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could not pay our penalty; and, indeed, from the evolution standpoint, there is no penalty for disobedience, but, on the contrary, a reward--of civilization and development.  There is no necessity, no place, for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in any such theory. All modern theories thus deny the ransom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The most insidious and dangerous &quot;enemies of the cross of Christ&quot; are those who, professing to be his servants and to preach his gospel, attack it on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inside,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by denying that God's work was perfect when he created man (`Deut. 32:4`); that man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from that perfection and divine likeness; that the right to recover him out of sin and death, to &quot;that which was lost,&quot; was purchased of Justice by &quot;the precious blood [shed,--death] of Christ.&quot;  By whatever ways any may attempt to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">climb</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> into the sheep-fold, they are wrong ways, and their advocates are pronounced to be &quot;thieves and robbers.&quot; (`John 10:9-11,15`.)  The keystone to the divine plan is that &quot;the man Christ Jesus gave himself a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [a corresponding price] for all, to be testified in due time.&quot; (`1 Tim. 2:6`.) Whatever theory does not square with this, absolutely and in every particular, is thus proven to be a false one.--`2 Cor. 11:13-15`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1719 : page 328::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE POWER OF FAITH.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;This is the victory [the conquering power] that overcometh the world, even our faith.&quot; --`1 John 5:4`.--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">BLESSED are the overcomers!  &quot;To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.&quot;--`Rev. 3:21`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What a reward is this which is held out as an incentive and inspiration to urge us on to noble and heroic effort!--to reign with Christ, to be his bride and joint-heir, his beloved and confidential companion through all eternity, and to be partakers of his divine nature and glory. These promises are freighted with an &quot;exceeding and eternal weight of glory,&quot; which &quot;eye</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1719 : page 329::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">hath not seen, nor ear heard; neither hath it entered into the heart of man; but God hath revealed it unto us [brought it within the range of our appreciation] by his spirit.&quot;  The words sound hollow and meaningless to those who have no appreciation of spiritual things, but to the consecrated children of God who are faithfully striving to meet the conditions upon which the fulfilment depends, and who have therefore a good hope, they are exceeding precious, and fill their hearts with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But between the present time and the realization of the promises there lies the necessity of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overcoming.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The word is strongly suggestive of a great conflict, and calls to mind also the Apostle Paul's expressions--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Fight</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fight</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of faith;&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Endure hardness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a good </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soldier</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ;&quot; &quot;Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">quit you like men, be strong.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  To overcome requires energy, force of character, perseverance and steadfast, patient endurance to the very end of the present life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the above text the Apostle John points to the only power which can sufficiently energize our whole being and nerve to patient endurance of tribulation, even to the end.  That conquering power is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Now,&quot; says the Apostle Paul, &quot;faith is a basis of things hoped for, a conviction of things unseen.&quot;  Faith is not merely belief or knowledge, but is knowledge applied, assimilated, appropriated--made a part of our habit of thought, a basis for our actions and a spur to all our energies.  Such a faith is the overcoming power which all must have who would run successfully the race for the prize of our high calling, and be overcomers.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What is it that is to be overcome?  John briefly comprehends it all in the expression, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then the whole world is against us in this battle.  Yes, its spirit, its popular methods, its ambitions, ideas, hopes and aims are all at variance with the elect Church of God, who are not of this world, even as Christ is not of this world.  The world is taking its own course, ignoring God, leaning to its own understanding and pursuing its own way.  Consequently, our course is in direct opposition to that of the world, and we must pull hard against the current of the world's spirit which is deeply inwrought in our old nature, as well as surrounding us on every side.  Yes, it is a hard pull; and we need all the inspiration and energy that faith can impart to accomplish it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is important, too, to see that our faith is a correct faith; for if the faith be an erroneous one, inspiring false and delusive hopes built upon sandy foundations, the stronger this impelling power becomes, the more surely and quickly will it drive its deluded victim to shipwreck upon the rocks.  Faith, like steam in an engine, is a power either for good or for evil. Hence the importance of a correct faith.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was because of this importance of faith, and of recognition of it as the motive power, either for good or for evil, that the Apostle Paul was so solicitous for the continuance of his converts in the faith. (See `1 Thes. 3:2,5,6,7,10`.)  He urged all to examine and prove themselves, whether they were in the faith, grounded and settled, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel, but rooted and built up in Christ and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">established</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the faith; and to beware lest any man spoil them through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. (`Col. 1:23`; `2:7,8`.)  He was deeply solicitous, too, that the faith of the Church should not stand in the wisdom (the vain philosophies) of men, but in the power of God.  And, therefore, in his preaching, he did not launch out into foolish speculations or follow his own or any other men's reasonings, and so pander to the popular craving for something new; but he confined himself to the expounding of the sacred Scriptures and to exhortations, inspired, as they were, by the revelations made to himself--a prophet, as well as an apostle.--`1 Cor. 2:4,13`; `2 Cor. 12:1-7`; `Gal. 1:11,12`; `2:2`; `2 Pet. 3:15,16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us see, then, that we have the faith of Christ--the faith well founded in the Word of God, a faith examined and proved, deeply rooted</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1720 : page 329::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">in the heart as well as in the head, and therefore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">established</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as the motive power of life. Such a faith is not nervously looking about for something new, and always probing the vain philosophies of men to see how skilfully they</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1720 : page 330::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">can withstand the Word of the Lord; for those who do so show plainly that their faith is not of sufficient influence to be the moving power in them, impelling them onward to full and complete victory over the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Faith, to be a conquering power in us, must go deeper than the head: it must go into the heart, and thus permeate and energize the whole being, bringing not only the outward conduct but every thought into subjection to Christ. Then indeed will faith impel to action, to works which clearly manifest it; for &quot;faith without works is dead.&quot;  A mere intellectual assent to the truth of God, which does not lead to activity in his service, is not faith, and can never overcome the world nor secure the prize of our high calling.  But this is the conquering power that overcometh the world, even our faith.  Let us examine ourselves and see that we have it pure and simple, and deeply inwrought in the fiber of our character, and that as an energizing principle it is moving us to faithful and persevering activity.  Let it be the governor and inspiration of our lives--a living faith which purges and purifies and strengthens to diligence and patience to the end of the narrow way to life.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In our last issue we stated that a different wording for the proposed Introductory Letter for traveling teaching brethren had been decided on; and this we give below.  It may be well, however, to guard against any misunderstanding by explaining:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. These letters are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">authorizations</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to preach.  That cannot be given by man.  All true disciples, trusting in the precious blood, and fully consecrated to the Lord's service, are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">authorized</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by God's Word to preach the gospel in any and every way they can do so; and according to their talents and opportunities such should be glad to do all the preaching they can do, publicly or privately, by word or pen or printed page.  (See `Matt. 28:19`.)  The Apostle Paul, while assuring us that his authorization or ordination as a minister was not of man nor by man, but of and from God only (`Gal. 1:1`), nevertheless went forth to his ministry with Barnabas under the auspices of the Church at Antioch--as the Lord's representative and as the representative of the Church at Antioch. (`Acts 13:3`; `14:26,27`.)  He evidently took just such a letter; for it was the usual custom to give and carry such letters. (`Phil. 2:28-30`; `Rom. 16:1-15,17`; `1 Cor. 16:3`; `Acts 18:27`.)  This is intimated in his epistle to the Corinthians-- &quot;Need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you,&quot; etc.? (`2 Cor. 3:1`.)  He did not need such a letter to the Church at Corinth, because, as he there explains, he himself had founded and established that Church and few could know him better than they, or them better than he.  But when first he visited the Church at Jerusalem, he did need letters, or more, a personal introduction. (See `Acts 9:26,27`.) It is this Apostolic custom and safeguarding of the flock that we seek to copy now, for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">benefit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of all concerned.  Individual letters would serve where the individuals are known, or Church letters would serve where the Churches are known; but in this case the Tract Society is known to you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we are confident that its introduction will be appreciated by the scattered ones everywhere.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">II. ZION'S WATCH TOWER TRACT SOCIETY is not a &quot;religious society&quot; in the ordinary meaning of this term; for it has no creed or Confession of Faith.  It is purely a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">business</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> association, whose mission is to serve in a business manner the wishes of its beneficiaries, who are represented in its officers.  How faithfully it has served these purposes thus far, its enemies no less than its friends bear witness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The design of the organization of the Tract Society is to keep the affairs and moneys, represented by it, quite separate from the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">individual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> affairs of its managers.  This present convenience, however, is still less than may be enjoyed in the future; for it is hoped that the death of any or all of those now managing the Fund would not destroy the Society nor totally hinder or involve its work, as the representative and servant of the household of faith, in economically providing tracts, etc., etc., for their use,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1720 : page 331::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">benefit and assistance in missionary work, since in its Charter provision is made for such contingency.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">III. The issuance of these Letters of Introduction means no more than if you or any other individual gave such a letter--except that it represents the judgment of experienced brethren, well informed respecting the character, ability, etc., of those introduced.--See `Acts 16:2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus, in this day of &quot;deceivers&quot; (`2 Tim. 3:1-13`; `Rom. 16:18`; `Matt. 24:24`; `Eph. 4:11-14`), you may the more readily receive those of whom we bear testimony, knowing that we will use conscientious care.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">IV. It will be noticed that the eight qualifications named in this Letter of Introduction are not doctrinal, except as to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the foundation: and we hold that without it none are Christians at all.  The other qualifications are those respecting </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">character,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and we believe them to be reasonable; and any one who could not confess them to be true of himself by the grace of God, we could not feel free to introduce as a proper person to be a teacher or a qualified servant, in the Church of the living God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is not to be understood that those making these professions of qualification claim to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfected</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in all those Christian graces and qualifications, but that they believe that they have them to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such a degree</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as they concede a representative of Christ should possess them, in order to be a servant of the Church in holy things. All possessed of the right spirit, however, will desire and strive to continually grow in grace and knowledge and love and in every good work, and expect to be perfected only when they awake in the resurrection, in the likeness of their Lord.--`1 Cor. 15:42,43`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This Introductory Letter expires December 31, 1895, and should be returned at that date, with application for renewal, if a new one is desired. The holder agrees to return this letter to the Society upon demand of the Society through its Board of Directors, at any time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Copy of the--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LETTER OF INTRODUCTION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">FROM ZION'S WATCH TOWER TRACT SOCIETY, ALLEGHENY, PA., U.S.A.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To the Church of the living God, whose names are written in heaven (`1 Tim. 3:15`; `Heb. 12:23`), Greeting!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We hereby commend to your Christian fellowship, and to your acceptance as a helper and counselor, our beloved brother and co-laborer, __________.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">He is a brother beloved in the Lord, well reported of by brethren who know him, and one whom we recognize as a child of God and follower of Christ (with all that this implies respecting good moral character); and we believe him to possess the following qualifications for SPECIAL SERVICE to the household of faith:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I. Unexceptional moral character, polished by the truth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">II. Meekness--that he may not become puffed up, and thus be injured himself, while seeking to help you.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">III. A </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">clear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> conception of the Lord's great plan, and large participation in its spirit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">IV. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ability</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to impart the truth to others in its own power and simplicity (not necessarily an orator).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">V. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Known</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fidelity to the doctrine of the ransom in its only true sense--a corresponding price or substitute for the forfeited life of Adam and his race, which inherits death through him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">VI. A humble mind, seeking to preach not himself, but Christ--not to air his own knowledge, but to present God's Word in its purity and simplicity.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">VII. A student of the Word, of cultivated thought, well founded and settled--not a wondering </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">novice;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not a teacher of speculations and fancies, nor of Anglo-Israelism, Socialism, Politics, Astronomical theories, or other questions not of spiritual profit, but to the subverting of the hearers (`2 Tim. 2:15-17`; `1 Tim. 4:7`; `6:20,21`); but--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">VIII. He comes to you seeking to establish the faith and character of the Church, presenting the One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism-- the one gospel, authorized by and based upon the one sacrifice, given once for all.</font><br />
<br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;LET PATIENCE HAVE HER PERFECT WORK.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.&quot; --`Jas. 1:4`.--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THE term &quot;patience&quot; carries with it the thought of meek, uncomplaining endurance of suffering with humble resignation and perseverance. It is a trait which indicates strength and self-discipline.  It cannot be predicated of inexperienced persons, but only of characters which have been subjected to trials of affliction, pain or loss; and it always shines brightest when manifested under the glowing heat of severe affliction.  This trait takes a very prominent place in the galaxy of Christian virtues; for without it the heart would grow faint, the head weary; and the steps would soon falter along the narrow way in which the Church is called to walk. &quot;In your patience possess ye your souls,&quot; said the Master, implying the danger of losing our souls, our existence, if we fail to cultivate this grace which is so very necessary to our continuance in well doing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle James does not overstate the matter when he intimates that the perfect work of patience will make its subjects perfect and entire, wanting nothing; for the Apostle Paul assures us that God, who has begun the good work of developing character in us, will continue to perform it until the crowning day--the day of Jesus Christ. (`Phil. 1:6`.)  All his children will be subjected to just such discipline as they need for the correction of faults, the implanting and development of virtues, and for their training and establishment in righteousness, so that they cannot be moved.  &quot;If ye be without chastisement [discipline and correction], whereof all [true sons of God] are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons; for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  If ye [patiently] endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?&quot;--`Heb. 12:8,6,7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This great work of developing and training character is necessarily a slow and tedious one, and not infrequently it is a painful process; and the patience that cheerfully submits to it is begotten of a high appreciation of the ends to be attained by it.  It is begotten of a love of righteousness, truth and godliness, and is therefore most noble and praiseworthy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But how can we let patience have her perfect work?  Just by meekly doing the best we can each day, and doing it cheerfully and well; making the best of every thing and going forward daily with true Christian fortitude to act the noble part in every emergency of affliction, pain or loss.  To-day's trial may be a light one, perhaps almost imperceptible; or to-day may be one of the sunny days in which God bids our hearts rejoice in his overflowing bounty. To-morrow may bring its cares and its petty vexations that irritate and annoy.  Another</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1721 : page 333::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">to-morrow may witness the clouds gather above our heads, and as the days follow each other the clouds may grow darker and darker until we are forcibly reminded of that strong figure of the Psalmist--&quot;I walk through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">valley of the shadow of death.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Yet never will the valley grow so dark that the patient, trusting one cannot triumphantly exclaim, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Though</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou [my Lord] art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.&quot; Yes, there is comfort in the &quot;rod&quot; (of chastisement), as well as in the &quot;staff&quot; (of providential care); for both are designed for our ultimate profiting.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle Paul tells us plainly that tribulation is necessary for the development of patience --&quot;Tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope.&quot; (`Rom. 5:3,4`.)  Consider how your own experience has verified this, you who have been for some time under the Lord's special care and leading.  How much richer you are for all the lessons of experience, and for the patience that experience has developed in you!  Although, like the Apostle, you can say that &quot;no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless, afterward, it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.&quot; (`Heb. 12:11`.) In the exercise of patience the lessons of experience have made you stronger.  They have increased your faith and drawn you into closer communion and fellowship with the Lord. They have made you feel better acquainted with and to realize more and more his personal interest in you and his care and love for you.  And this in turn has awakened a deeper sense of gratitude and an increasing zeal to manifest that gratitude to him.  This also deepens the sense of fellowship with God, and gives confidence to the hope of final and full acceptance with him as a son and heir, worthy through Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and [strengthen] the feeble knees&quot;-- &quot;Let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle James urges that we take the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience.  Then he cites the example of Job and the manifest end or purpose of the Lord in permitting him to be so sorely tried: how the Lord was really very pitiful and of tender mercy, although the pity and mercy were not manifest except to the confiding faith that said, &quot;Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him&quot; --until the long and painful discipline had yielded the peaceable fruits and the subsequent rewards of righteousness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is little virtue in the patience that endures merely from motives of worldly policy, though even that often has much advantage in it.  Men in business dealings with fellow-men well know that an impetuous, turbulent disposition is greatly to their disadvantage, while patient consideration, temperance in judgment, and good self-control are of immense value, even from a worldly, business standpoint.  But the patience that is begotten of deep-rooted Christian principle is the kind that will endure all trials and shine the brighter for every affliction through which it may pass.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Job, the servant of God, was accused of selfish policy-motives for his remarkable patience and faithfulness; and it was boldly affirmed that if he were tried by adversity his mean motives would be manifest--that he would curse God to his face.  But God knew better; and it was in Job's defence that he permitted him to be tried to the utmost that the loyalty of his heart might be manifest.  Some of his poor comforters viewed Job's afflictions only in the light of chastisements, failing utterly to comprehend the divine purpose, and this only added stings to his afflictions; but through them all the Lord brought his servant and most fully vindicated him in the eyes of all the people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus will he ever do with all who patiently maintain their integrity and trust in God under affliction.  If any man recognize affliction as a chastisement of the Lord for the correction of some evil way in him, let him be quick to learn the lesson and repent; or if it be refining discipline, let patience under the tedious process have its perfect work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle Paul (`Heb. 11`) calls up a long list of patient, faithful ones who endured cruel</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1721 : page 334::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">mockings and scourgings, bonds and imprisonment, who were stoned, sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword, who wandered about in sheep-skins and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented; of whom the world was not worthy; who wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  All this they endured patiently for righteousness' sake, looking by faith to God for the reward of their patience and faithfulness in his own good time.  Then again, says the Apostle (`Heb. 12:3`), &quot;Consider him [Christ] that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.&quot;  Yea, consider him, &quot;who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.&quot;  He left us an example that we should follow his steps.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While we see the great necessity for pruning, cultivating and discipline in the development of character, it is manifest that none will be able to endure it unto the desirable end of final establishment in righteousness who do not from the beginning diligently devote themselves to the exercise of patience.  &quot;He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&quot; &quot;In your patience possess ye your souls.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;He taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.&quot;--`Mark 1:22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The opportunities of the synagogue and the Sabbath day were eagerly embraced by our Lord, affording, as they did, very favorable circumstances for the presentation of the truth.  The habit of calling upon suitable persons in the congregation for the reading and expounding of the law and the prophets opened wide this door of usefulness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Lord's dealing with the unclean spirits (`verses 23-26,34`) shows three things --(1) the actual personal existence of invisible evil spirits.  This one manifested his power to act, think, speak, and to hear and obey; and the Lord recognized and addressed him as a person, and commanded his obedience. (2) The power, and limit of power, in such beings.  They can do nothing except as God permits them; nor can they invade the mind or heart of any man, save as he submits his will to their power.  (3) The circumstances manifested the fact that the Lord's authority and power are known and recognized by the evil spirits.  A very similar expression to that of `verse 24` is found in `Matt. 8:29` --&quot;Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?&quot;--showing that they know of an appointed time for the judgment of angels as well as of men.  &quot;Know ye not that ye shall judge angels?&quot; said the Apostle, addressing the Church; and the fallen angels seem to have found it out.*</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lord's wonderful power and sympathy, manifested in the healing of multitudes of the sick and afflicted, in casting out devils and in preaching the blessed gospel of the coming Kingdom, were but a faint illustration of his mighty power to be exerted at the time appointed, and now at hand, for the blessing of all the families of the earth.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins.&quot;--`Mark 2:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The healing of the sick was one of the distinguishing features of our Lord's earthly ministry--doubtless for several reasons, which are very manifest--(1) It foreshadowed the great work of his Millennial reign --the healing of the nations and the wiping away of all tears from off all faces.  (2) His miraculous healing of the sick and raising of the dead attracted wide attention, drew the multitudes to see and hear him, and established his authority as a teacher sent from God.  (3) It manifested his love and sympathy for the afflicted and suffering.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Quite a difference will be observed between the work of the Lord during the three and a half years of his ministry and that of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1722 : page 335::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">the Apostles.  Jesus taught mainly the surface and introductory truths of Christianity, and beyond these he opened his mouth only in parables and dark sayings which could seldom be understood by those who heard, while the Apostles brought forth the deeper things of God and did very little healing, etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This was because the time had not yet come for opening up the deep things of God, and consequently the people were not yet prepared to receive them.  It was as our Lord said upon one occasion,--&quot;I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now: howbeit, when he, the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth...and he will show you things to come.&quot; (`John 16:12,13`.)  At Pentecost the holy spirit came upon the early Church, and has been in the hearts of all God's truly consecrated people ever since, enabling all such to hear the deep things with appreciation and gladness and some to teach it with power and unction.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">After the first introduction of Christianity, the miracle-working power gradually left the Church (`1 Cor. 13:8`), because no more needed as an introduction, and because the times of restitution--of healing and refreshing the world--had not yet come, and were not designed to be inaugurated for eighteen hundred years.  But the deep and glorious truths of God's Word, the &quot;exceeding great and precious promises&quot; now made manifest to his saints, are the many things which the Lord had to tell, but which none were able to receive prior to the day of Pentecost.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand our Lord's words, &quot;Greater works than these shall he do&quot; (`John 14:12`), to refer to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual work</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Church during this Gospel age,--opening the eyes of men's understanding and, as God's ambassadors, calling and perfecting the saints for the great work of the Millennial age.  We can conceive of no greater or grander work than this: it is certainly far superior to the curing of the physically blind and lame and deaf.  Our Lord could not engage in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> greater work himself, because the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could not be &quot;called&quot; or accepted to divine favor and anointing with the spirit of adoption until provision had been made for the forgiveness of their sins.  That provision was our Lord's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as a &quot;ransom for all&quot; and his ascent &quot;on high, there to appear in the presence of God for us [on our behalf].&quot;  Thus the &quot;greater&quot; work was left to his followers under his direction, but made possible for them by his previous work--his sacrifice of himself.  The partial offer, favor to fleshly Israel, was by virtue of their typical justification and typical acceptance with God by the typical merit of their typical atonement sacrifices.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the Lord perceived the faith of the afflicted one and his friends, his reply, &quot;Son, thy sins be forgiven thee,&quot; implied that restoration to the divine favor which guaranteed healing and full restitution to health and life in God's appointed time.  Apparently the Lord was going to let him wait the appointed time, with the simple assurance of the present favor of God, thus to test his faith and the measure of his satisfaction in the assurance.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His object in subsequently granting the immediate cure, as stated in `verse 10`, was to manifest his authority to forgive sins-- &quot;That ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy), I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.  And immediately he arose, took up the bed and went forth before them all.&quot;  This was the divine testimony to the power of Jesus to forgive sins and to bring to pass in God's own time all the blessings that forgiveness of sins implies; viz., full restitution to human perfection. Praise the Lord for the good tidings illustrated and emphasized in the miracles of our Lord!</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR FRIENDS:--Coming out of a gospel meeting, a copy of your publication, entitled &quot;Do You Know?&quot; was handed to me.  I have read it eagerly, and fully realize the facts revealed therein to be the real truth, and of the utmost importance for every Christian to know.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the last paragraph of the above mentioned publication I have noticed your kind solicitude for the poor in spirit and for the hungry after righteousness; and, being one of them, I hasten to write to you and respectfully ask you to supply me with some food.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am one of the lost sheep of the house</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1722 : page 336::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of Israel.  Recently the Lord opened my eyes, and I saw my Good Shepherd afar off.  I ran to him over cavities and mountains, through thick forests and heavy walls, until I came near him, that I need only stretch my arms to embrace my dear Lord and Savior; and, O Lord! there is still another mighty obstacle obstructing my way: one which I am not able to remove myself, nor know I of a strong friend near me who would offer me aid.  I am therefore rejoicing over your proposition, and hasten to apply to you for assistance, and trust that through your superior theological knowledge I will be able to embrace my dear Lord and Savior freely and consciously, and attach myself to him for ever.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am now reading the New Testament thoughtfully the second time.  Every word makes a deep impression upon my mind.  I am fully convinced, and heartily believe, that our great Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is the Son of the living God, the authorized ruler of earth and the direct Mediator between the mighty Father and the sinful world, and that only through believing in him, and by his precious blood, can our sins be cleansed away, and we become white as snow.  These facts came to me partly from the New Testament, but mostly from the Old Testament and from the fiery Law.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The obstacle that now obstructs my way is `Matt. 28:19`, and the general Christian doctrine of &quot;Trinity,&quot; which conflicts very much with the first and most important commandment of our mighty Father.  In the first commandment, the Lord said, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (perfect in himself) the Lord thy God, and thou shalt have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no other</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> gods before me. He also emphasized this very important commandment by placing a heavy punishment upon disobedience to it. (`Exod. 20:2,3,5`.) Now, if a Christian must believe in &quot;Trinity,&quot; that the godhead is composed of three persons, the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit, it is in my judgment (I fear to utter it) a violation of that very commandment. I would therefore be exceedingly grateful to you, dear friends, if you would be so kind as to give me a plain and explicit</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1723 : page 336::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">explanation on the above subject, that I and my family, and perhaps many others whom the Lord may privilege me to bring under his shelter, may live in the beauty of truth and holiness.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BRETHREN:--About two months before having seen or known of MILLENNIAL DAWN and its wonderful and glorious Bible teachings, I had solemnly given myself to God in consecration, earnestly seeking to know and to do his will.  When I began to investigate the DAWN, seeing that it was somewhat different from other religious books, I read critically and prayerfully, going to the Father, through Christ (`John 14:6`), and leaning on his promise to give wisdom to them who ask, seek and knock; and so I was ready to search its pages according to the will of God--whether it were truth or error, &quot;strong meat&quot; or simply the theory of man.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Hungering and thirsting after truth, I continued to read, searching the Scriptures daily, drinking in the refreshing truths from the eternal fountain of all love--God.  With the knowledge of these things in my heart, my experience is one of joy and real satisfaction. Nevertheless, since I began to walk in the path of light, and to appreciate the exceeding great and precious promises, I noticed the way was not smooth and easy, but rough, difficult and narrow, with many obstacles to overcome.  I saw I must be tested and tried (to prove my love for, and appreciation of, the truth), not only during my first lessons, but at all times afterward. So I realize that I must </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overcome,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;press</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">toward the mark</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the prize,&quot; walking by faith, while the way becomes more narrow and steep, even until the end, when the blessed goal is reached, and the crown of life received.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have endeavored to carry the good news to others; and it is my purpose to &quot;continue in the word,&quot; and let the light shine, &quot;holding forth the word of life,&quot; no matter what it may cost me.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A WONDERFUL THING IN RELIGION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;Our enterprising Jewish contemporary, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tidings,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> prints a report of the ceremonies at the dedication of the new and grand synagogue in Cleveland, and we are not going too far when we say that some of the things told of in the report are wonderful.  Is it not a wonder that a half dozen of the Protestant ministers of Christianity united with the rabbi of the synagogue before the Jewish shrine in delivering discourses of exultation at the dedication of the edifice erected for the service of the Congregation Tiffereth Israel?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We do not remember ever hearing of any other incident just like it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The six denominations of Protestant Christianity were represented by the six clergymen, who took part in the proceedings of the occasion. One of these clergymen was an Episcopalian; and the others were a Presbyterian, a Methodist, a Congregationalist, a Disciple, and the pastor of the Epworth Memorial Church.  The Rev. CHARLES S. MILLS (Congregationalist) was, as we are told by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tidings,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> 'generous in his congratulations,' and exclaimed: 'As Jews and Christians worshiping one GOD, the GOD of ABRAHAM, ISAAC and JACOB, we should unite for the spreading of the truth in America, and for the solution of the problems which confront us.'  The Rev. HARRIS R. COOLEY (Disciple), in addressing Rabbi GRIES, asked these significant questions: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">'Is there, after all, such a difference</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">between us?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Have we not one GOD?'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The clergymen judiciously refrained from making any allusion to the Gospel in that place.  We guess they were more shrewd than the Apostle PETER or the Apostle PAUL would have been under the circumstances.  Their conduct, as one of them took occasion to remark, gave evidence of the progress of liberal thought in the community.  The conduct of Rabbi GRIES, also, in inviting the ministers, gave evidence of this new kind of progress among the Jewish people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It seems to us that the thing here told of deserves to rank among the wonders of the nineteenth century.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">N.Y. Sun.</font></b><br />
