<p><span class="font0">Reactions also tell on leading nations. Russia and the United States may deny they fear each other. Yet their hoarding nuclear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Our reactions tell on us every day. A thought is advertised by a smile or a frown. Embarrassment lights up the blushing face. Fear speaks the truth about a coward. Poverty tells whether a man thinks it is sometimes right to steal. Reactions tell the lie detector the accused is not telling the truth. With no words and little effort our reactions shout what we might not care to whisper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Motives are often exposed by common reactions. A well-known columnist once advised his readers not to close the door when leaving a taxi. First settle the fare and tip. “If he thanks you, then shut it. If he doesn’t, let him come around and do it himself.” It was suggested that the cabby might get hit by another car in the process! Such advice is typical of the unhappy reactor who is governed by the acweapons tells a different story. Friends of Uncle Sam say he lacks initiative and a positive program of his own. They base this on his perpetual reaction to the Kremlin’s moves. Belated overtures toward South America and the &quot;emerging” nations are said to indicate more reaction to communism than the doings of a “Good Samaritan.” The Communists also reveal things by reaction. For years they have said that religion is the opium of the people—something that causes sleep. But violent reaction to the underground work of Jehovah’s witnesses shows the Communists really fear the power of religion to wake people up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two centuries ago a man said, &quot;If religion does nothing for your temper it has done nothing for your soul.” That is still true and your reactions will quickly tell it. Many persons resemble doors that function by electric eye. Let anyone cross their path and they start swinging. The result is often disastrous. Recently in Brooklyn, New York, a motorist stopped to park. In that instant a second car nosed into the lone parking space. Tempers and fists exploded—down went the second driver, fatally striking his head against the curb. Solomon long ago predicted the results of unbridled reaction: “He that is quick to anger will commit foolishness.”—Prov. 14:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No one is saying that all reaction is bad. It is often good, useful and necessary. When you jump at the “honk!&quot; of a car horn or investigate the strange scent of smoke, that is practical and wise. When you thank God for life, hope and your daily bread, you show loving appreciation. When you feel indignant about discrimination and kangaroo courts, credit your sense of justice. When you work to face up to an emergency, that is proper use of power. Your ability to reflect God’s cardinal attributes proves you are made in his image. Unfortunately too many allow the image to fade. They replace it with emotion or raw passion. It was that way in the days of the Latin poet Claudian, who observed: “He is next to the gods whom reason and not passion impels.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The apostle Paul referred to our Creator as a “happy” God. Christ is called the “happy&quot; Potentate. (1 Tim. 1:11; 6:15) How can God be happy when so many creatures break his laws, ignore his word —even deny that he exists? The answer is clear. God is not a perpetual reactor. He says, “I am Jehovah; I have not changed.” (Mal. 3:6) He exercises his wisdom, love, justice and power in perfect balance, regardless of what his creatures do. His every action or reaction is based on discernment, No crisis tempts him to act in haste. He causes the rain to fall upon the thankful and the unthankful. He sends out the good news of his kingdom to all kinds of men. When the due time for Armageddon’s destruction arrives, he will allow it to come, not because he has pleasure in the death of the wicked, but because he loves righteousness. Confident that his will shall be done on earth as in heaven, Jehovah God remains happy. His Son, Christ Jesus, is likewise “the same yesterday and today, and forever.” (Heb. 13:8) He is a mighty God with perfect self-control. Neither insult nor injury to himself or his subjects can make him deviate from truth and righteousness. He too is happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We mortals can share this joy by making the effort. Instead of shaking your fist at every unkind remark, “turn the other cheek.” Discard abusive speech and </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">dis</span><span class="font0">-cover the power of a mild answer to turn away rage. Instead of bringing home the day’s irritations to contaminate a pleasant evening, exercise the love that “does not become provoked” and “does not keep account of the injury.” Carefully study and apply the Bible’s inspired principles as your daily guide. In this twilight era between the old world and God’s new world it will prove to be a bright lamp to your foot and a light to your road. Its inspired wisdom will enable you to act positively and react with discernment, as God does. You will develop a personality that wins his approval. It is He who promised: “The one firmly standing for righteousness is in line for life.”—Prov. 11:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your actions and reactions tell God and man what you are and how you think. Be and think right. It is pleasant “listening” when your reactions agree with your deeds and words.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">H</span><span class="font0">OW much of your life </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">t </span><span class="font0">is influenced by what your ancestors did? Do their superstitions make you wary of black cats, spilled salt and walking under ladders? Do their prejudices affect your feelings toward other races and nationalities? Do thei religious beliefs, formal-I isms and holy days set the religious pattern that you follow? Some traditional beliefs and practices are beneficial, but others can be detrimental because they confine your thinking within rigid boundaries set losophy of imperfect men or by views that are basically wrong. They can blind you to the truth. That is why the Scriptures warn: “Look out: perhaps there may be someone who will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ.”—Col. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tradition can be any belief, custom, way of life or attitude that has its roots in your family or national past and that has been passed down to you. It may be that you purposely hold to your traditions because they are very old. Their age has given them an aura of sanctity in your eyes so that it would seem sacrilegious for you to go against them. Note what the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said on this point: “Every tradition grows ever more ven erable—the more remote is its origin, the more confused that origin is. The reverence due to it increases from generation to generation. The tradition finally becomes holy and inspires awe.” Suppose that tradition is a wrong attitude, opinion or belief. Then you would be cher- .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ishing or venerating a lie. You would be bound to a lie by a force that cannot easily be broken. What you need is something by which you can measure the truthfulness and value of a tradition. You have such a measuring rod in God’s written Word, the Holy Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Most traditions appear to be ruts in which people of past ages began walking and in which their descendants have continued to walk without regard for whether they are right or wrong. Perhaps it is from fear to try something new or from an unconscious worshiping of ancestors or reluctance to violate something that has become holy from age that people refuse to break out of these ruts. Whatever the reason may be, traditions that are not in harmony with the Scriptures can exercise a paralyzing power upon your thinking and actions so that you may feel compelled to continue doing what your ancestors did although that may be Scripturally wrong.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Retard Progress</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">How traditions retard progress and blind people to the religious freedom offered by Jehovah’s written Word can be seen in the country of India. There the traditional attitude toward animals that are considered to be holy places a tremendous burden on the economy of the country and great hardships on the people. It prevents the nation from producing enough food for its rapidly growing population. Commenting on this problem, the magazine C.S. News </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;&nbsp;World Report</span><span class="font0"> observed; “Millions of aged or useless cows, bands of wild monkeys, rats and other animals consume far more food than India imports each year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The traditional beliefs of the people there make it seem proper to permit humans to starve rather than reduce the number of animals that devour their food. India has almost one fourth of the cattle population of the world, but tradition does not permit the cattle to be used for food. Although 10 percent of the cows are old and useless, they are allowed to live. The cows consume the output of 40 million of India’s 300 million cultivated acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Indian caste system is another harmful tradition that has been preserved for ages. It restricts relationship between certain classes and eliminates neighbor love as well as fellow feeling. A member of one caste may not accept food or drink from certain other castes, and when he gives food or drink to members of one of these castes he considers the dishes they touch to be defiled. How can this tradition engender love and unity? Because of the paralyzing power of tradition the people of India in general cannot see that the caste system is bad and that the love and human equality taught in Jehovah’s written Word are much better for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The people of Christendom can learn much from observing the crippling power of human traditions in India and other nations of the Far East. It should alert them to the imprisoning influence of their own traditions. They should frankly consider how their thinking may be rigidly controlled by racial and religious views that were dogmatically fixed by their forefathers. Like the people of India, they too can be caught in a traditional rut that blinds them to the freedom-bringing truths of the Scriptures.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Condict with Truth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The way man’s Creator wants to be worshiped and the truths about himself that he wants man to know are clearly set out in his written Word. God being the Source of truth, his Word can be trusted. It is the measuring rod of what is right and true. This makes it a higher authority than human traditions. That is why Jesus Christ continually referred to it rather than to the traditions of the elders. But a surprisingly large number of people in Christendom are so captivated by the opinions and beliefs of their ancestors that they set the Bible aside in preference for them. When their traditional beliefs and practices disagree with the Bible, they will claim that they cannot be satisfied with the Bible alone. They will insist that the traditions of their church are of equal value. For such persons traditions of men have blinded them to the truth and taken them captive to the imaginations of their ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus was confronted with the blinding effect of human tradition when he was doing his Father’s will on earth over 1900 years ago. The Jewish religious leaders insisted on holding to the views and customs handed down to them from their rabbinic predecessors. Because those traditions were the products of human thinking, they frequently contradicted the Word of God. That is why Jesus said to them: “Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? . . . you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you, when he said, ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their heart is far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’ ”—Matt. 15:3, 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Doctrines and superstitions believed by ancestors are not beyond question. Their being believed for a long time does not make them right. Whether you venerate your ancestors or merely hold them in high respect, you have no reason to imagine that they were infallible in their beliefs. God’s Word assures us that they were imperfect and could make mistakes. Your loyalty should be for what the Scriptures indicate to be the truth rather than for the opinions, beliefs and customs of imperfect forefathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the paralyzing power of tradition blinded the eyes of people in the first century to Scriptural truths and prevented them from accepting the changes that were instituted by Jehovah through his Son, so it blinds people today to Scriptural truths and divine changes. Showing preference for their traditions, people inside Christendom as well as outside of it reject these truths. They persist in believing what their forefathers believed, in performing the same burdensome ceremonies they did and in observing the same holy days they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It'matters not to them that God’s Word does not give support to these practices and beliefs. They were bom into a traditional rut, and they mistakenly think they must remain in it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Break Loose to Do God’s Will</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus Christ said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (John 8:32) So it does, if you will listen to it rather than to the opinions and beliefs of ancestors that contradict it. Through his servants, Jehovah calls out “liberty to those taken captive and the wide opening of the eyes even to the prisoners.” (Isa. 61:1) He brings freedom to those imprisoned by traditional beliefs and practices. This he is doing by means of the many eye-opening Scriptural truths that his dedicated witnesses are proclaiming world-wide. They have caused people that were captive to superstitions and burdensome customs to be set free and to begin doing the complete will of God in his New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why permit the traditions of men to govern your thinking and your life? Why let them spoil your acceptableness to God? Break loose from the paralyzing power of traditions that contradict His Word. Turn from the venerating of dead men and the enslaving dogmas that put you in fear of religious leaders. Climb out of your traditional rut and broaden your view of God’s purposes for man.

<p><span class="font1">•</span><span class="font0">x ROWN-UPS are real “cry ba-jK bies,” say eye physicians. They v “cry” all the time. Of course, adults do not always shed ** tears the way children often do, that is, uncontrollably. Nevertheless, they do cry. And fortunate it is for them that they do, because to remain dry-eyed over any long period of time spells serious trouble for the eyes. Therefore, for the health and protection of the eyes, tiny sprinklers, called “tear ducts,” are constantly at work sprinkling refreshing and cleansing dewlike moisture over the eyes every minute of the day and night, only in minute amounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tears are generally associated with sorrow and grief, but it is also true that people shed tears of joy. There are times when fear, anger, frustration and even beautiful scenes and searching music will cause tears to flood the eyes. Therefore, a study of tears is not only fascinating from the viewpoint of their efficiency and purpose, but also is helpful in gaining greater insight and understanding of ourselves and others by looking into the causes of tears. Behind every tear there is usually a reason, for tears are the silent, yet eloquent words of the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Technically speaking, people shed two kinds of tears. Tears that flow in anger, sorrow or pain are said to be made up of chemical ingredients that are slightly different from those that shield the eye from a speck of dirt, cold weather or the irritating spray of an onion peel. Both kinds of tears, however, come from a small gland that lies safely cuddled in a little hollow just behind the upper outer angle of the eye socket. The tear fluid is spread over the eyeball by the normal blinking of the lids. The eyelids close, not only when there is danger, but regularly from three to six times a minute. When they shut for an instant, they carry over the eye a thin mucoid secretion supplied by the inside lining of the lids. This normal “sprinkler and lubrication system” keeps the eye moist. It also prevents friction between eye and lid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The normal drainage of tears is through a small opening in the skin of the inner corner of the lids. From there the tears make their way down through a narrow channel into the back of the nose and throat. Since the sprinkling process goes on constantly, the drainage system must also be in constant operation. Yet so efficiently does it work that seldom is a person aware of it. It is only when the tear ducts become obstructed, as in older years, or when a person cries and the channels are flooded, that we get to see tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is amazing how great the daily quantity of tears is or how great a quantity can be produced by the normal eye. For example, in deep sorrow when tears flow freely, it might be necessary not only to wipe the eyes but to blow the nose as well to remove the excess product of sorrow. Israel’s king David said of himself: “I have grown weary with my sighing; all night long I make my couch swim; with my tears I make my own divan overflow.” Others speak of being baptized in tears.—Ps. 6:6.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Ready-made Eyewash</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">While you are having a good cry, you may be doing yourself a lot of good emotionally, but that is not the only function of tears. It is said that the main purpose of tears is to wash the eye and prevent infection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tears actually do disinfect the eyes. They contain a substance called lysozyme, which “is an antiseptic able to kill bacteria when it is diluted thousands of times!” This is one of the findings of Dr. Robert Brunish of the University of California. Foreign substances, such as dust, smog and dirt, find their way into the eyes. The body’s eyewash not only cleanses away the foreign matter, but its antiseptic properties also save the eye from serious infection. This it has done many times without your knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The irritating antiseptic content of tears is easily seen after a person has been crying for a while. The eyes turn red; the eyelids and cheeks become swollen. And yet how remarkable that the delicate tissues lining the eyeball itself, and which are bathed in tears for a lifetime, show no ill effects from the antiseptic properties. The reason why is just another one of the Creator’s little secrets. For “the hearing ear and the seeing eye—Jehovah himself has made even both of them.”—Prov. 20: 12.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>A Tear as a Tool</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">According to Dr. Olive Fedde Erickson of Stanford Medical School, tears may soon become a diagnostic tool in physical checkups as blood tests are nowadays. After analyzing more than 2,000 tear samples, she stated that chemical variations in tears may provide a precise clue to the patient’s health. She said that healthy persons have a balance in the three chemical elements that make up tears, namely, lysozyme, globulins and albumins, but sick people show noticeable changes. When patients underwent severe stress, ate an unbalanced diet, suffered from rheumatic fever or arthritis, the changes in tear chemical content were from subtle to striking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To provide the doctor with a tear sample, all the patient need do is to insert a small bent filter paper under the lower eyelid. The operation is painless. After the paper absorbs the tears, it is sent to the laboratory, where the contents of the filter paper are examined and the chemistry of the tears is determined. The tests take about seven hours.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Causes Behind Tears</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Besides being an excellent eyewash and </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">barometer of our health, our tears can reveal many things about ourselves. They can tell whether we are harboring secrets, whether we are sympathetic and compassionate. Of them Washington Irving wrote: “There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love.” To trace their source, one must look not only into the eye but deep into the heart. Because in disappointments, in human misery, in sorrow and in joy, these briny riverlets grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For example, paging through a family album or reading a few verses from the Bible can bring tears, especially to the eyes of those well along in years. Behind their tears lie important truths. Often such tears tell of the passing of youth, of precious years never to be relived, of the pathetic shortness of life itself, of human suffering, of fond memories and of a happy life lived. Those tears can teach us precious lessons, if we but use them as a stimulus to reflection. They can teach us to suck all the sweetness out of life while it lasts. They can teach us that our greatest happiness comes from ‘fearing the true God and keeping his commandments. For this is the whole duty of man.’—Eccl. 12: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our tears reveal how we feel toward ourselves and others. Recently an elderly man stopped halfway up a flight of stairs. Tears flooded his eyes. “I used to run up these stairs,” he said. “Now look at me. I can’t even walk up.” His tears told of a losing battle against time and death. Tears filled the eyes of a young man who saw the old man’s plight. Later, when the young man was asked, “Why the tears?” he replied: “O because he’s so old, so pathetic, I guess.” He could not find words to express what his tears proclaimed: his great compassion for the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us have compassion for one another. Let us be loving and tenderhearted, freely forgiving one another, even as God forgave us. Because it will be only too soon when we, too, will be in need of some compassion and sympathy.—Col. 3:12-14; Rom. 3:23.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Fighting Tears</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Many people fight tears. They are afraid to show compassion. Many men think it unmanly to cry. They will clear their throats, cough, and go through the strangest antics just to keep from shedding a tear. “Scorn the proud man that is ashamed to weep,” said the poet Young. Jesus Christ, the greatest of men, was not ashamed to weep. Yes, Jesus wept. He “gave way to tears,” says the Bible. His tears were an expression of his great affection for his friend Lazarus, who had died. Do you have tears of affection for your friends?—John 11:35; Mark 1:41; 6:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Albert Smith called tears “the safety-valves of the heart when too much pressure is laid on it.” It is to our benefit then if we let tears flow. To suppress tears is to deny the body a natural access to relief. This can lead to serious body disorders. A girl who was told not to cry when her father died became ill and died. She was killed by an emotion she would not allow herself to express'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Frequently chronic colds, sinus trouble, painful shoulders and nightmares are caused from suppressed emotions. A woman who complained about a chronic cold and sinus trouble was told to let herself go and cry when she felt like it. As soon as she did, she found that her colds and sinusitis disappeared.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Bitter Tears and Tears of Joy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">There are also bitter tears born of idle or lonely years spent. There are tears over sin, tears of shame and woe, as well as tears of laughter and joy. Emile G. Hirsch wrote: “Only they have to weep bitter tears who know what has come to them is the result of their foolish conduct, their ignorant way, their want of proper understanding of life and what love means.” No doubt most of the tears shed in the world are the result of unwise actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When strong men, schooled in the art of war, were confronted with war’s horrifying effects, many of these men broke down and cried like babies. They drowned their bitterness in tears. Their tears were a way of saying that men were not made to hate and kill, that man was made to love and create, to build and to plant, not destroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An erring man may shed tears of shame and repentance. A man whose hopes have been shattered may shed tears of dreams unfulfilled. Tears that flood the eyes at the sight of a beautiful mountain or at the sound of lovely music may be tears of unexpressed sadness or of inexpressible joy. Who is there to deny that there are times when tears flow from sheer joy? Sometimes a heart overfilled with appreciation will find no other way to express itself but in tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bible, however, tells us of a time when God “will wipe out every tear” from men’s eyes. These tears that God will wipe away are not the tears that bathe and protect the eye, but the tears that have resulted from sorrow brought about by Adamic sin. In Jehovah’s new world of righteousness Adamic sin will be done away with, thus tears caused as a result of his sin will be no more. Of that time the prophet wrote: “The Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken it.”—Rev. 21:4; Isa. 25:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So tears are needful, beneficial and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. They tell of our heartaches, our longings, our affections, our compassion, our sympathy, our needs. By letting tears flow we allow the safety valves of our heart to do their work when too much pressure is brought to bear. As after the rain come sunny skies, so with tears come physical relief to ourselves and greater compassion for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">II Surgeon Who Bolieues in the Golden Rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">•$&gt; The position that Jehovah's witnesses take in the matter of blood transfusions has furnished the members of the medical profession a golden opportunity to demonstrate whether they believe in what is usually referred to as the Golden Rule: &quot;All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.” (Matt. 7:12) The following letter tells of one who did:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;The obstetrician that attended me during my first pregnancy, before I became one of Jehovah's witnesses, refused to render me service because I had asked him to make a notation on my chart that under no circumstances was I to receive a blood transfusion. He said that I was erazy and that all the rest of Jehovah’s witnesses were also crazy. I was also refused by another well-known obstetrician at the same hospital for the same reason. &amp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I learned about ... an obstetrician who practices at another hospital here. On my first visit to his office I found him kind and considerate, a doctor who respects Jehovah’s witnesses as well as the work they are doing. When I presented him with my problem, he said: ‘I notice that the population of Jehovah’s witnesses is growing in this [United</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">$ States West Coast] city. Someone has to start facing the problem concerning them and blood</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">$ transfusion. I’ve never run from a fight yet, X so stick with me, and we will work something out. This experience will be a good test for ,£ your faith in your religion as well as a good test for me in the medical field.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">X &lt;g&gt; “He went on to say that he would at once •J* prescribe large amounts of iron tablets to take daily so that I would be extra strong if</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">X an emergency should arise, even though he *]• did not expect that I would need a blood trans-J. fusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">■ff</span><span class="font17"> &lt;$&gt; “He talked with a lawyer about drawing **’ up a statement that I could sign stating that X I do not want a blood transfusion, so that I would be protected and he also.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">T</span><span class="font0">HE airport announcer calls for all passengers to get aboard. The big plane moves out to the end of the -runway. The &lt;■ green light flash- J es from the control tower. Engines roar, and the beautiful silver-colored machine rises into the air and disappears into northern skies. This is just another regular airline flight across the top of the world to one of the great cities of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A smartly dressed stewardess takes care of the passengers’ needs as they relax in well-upholstered seats of the warm, pressurized cabin, so no one feels discomfort from the high altitude. In winter travelers can look down on the snowy vastness of the Canadian Arctic, and in summer they view the unending panorama of lovely lakes, rivers and forests until the Arctic Ocean is reached. Here they speed over the land of the midnight sun, so that the plane’s windows frame a picture of that glowing orb as it casts beautiful reflections off the drifting ice fields below. But how much flying in the far north has changed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “bush pilots” of earlier years flew aircraft that could be put inside the cabin of the modern giants of the air, with plenty of room left over. Many of these men received their training, skill, ingenuity and resourcefulness in the aerial dogfights of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">World War I. They were men who were at home with danger, and so were willing to accept the challenge of making accessible the potential</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">wealth of Canada’s vast northern hinterland. The key to opening up this territory was transportation—up to this time confined to slow-moving dog teams in winter and sternwheeler river boats in the short open-water season. These pioneers of aviation in Canada saw, in the airplane, a means of quickly and economically transporting mail, freight and passengers into previously inaccessible areas,</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Uncharted Territory</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">In those early years of “bush flying,” it must be remembered, maps of these areas were unreliable, some having large white spots on them marked “Unexplored area.” Besides this, there were no landing fields at intervals with lighted smooth runways, or radio stations to report on weather and keep up two-way voice communication with machines in the air. Even the compasses of these early aircraft were not too reliable, especially when one ventured over areas where there were large bodies of magnetic iron ores, or into the region of the north magnetic pole. So, when over one such area, a bush flier replied to a query as to whether he flew by means of a compass or by landmarks: “By landmarks'. Look, there are millions of them'.” Thus it can be understood why it was often said of these men that they “flew by the seat of their trousers.” A plane would disappear into northern skies and no one would know whether the flight was successful until it returned to its base, sometimes as much as thirty-eight days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such flying encouraged extreme care and resourcefulness on the part of both pilots and engineers, because it was essentially a two-man job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pilots had many and varied problems to face. In summer when flying in to uncharted lakes and rivers, there was always the danger of striking hidden reefs or rocks with the pontoons when landing or taxiing. This would mean taking up residence in that spot until repairs could be made or flown in from the base—providing your flying mates knew where to look for you! Landing on a lake or river when there was a dead calm was another hazard. The surface of the water would be just like a mirror, and so it was difficult for the pilot to judge distances correctly. The result might be that the engine would be “cut” too soon and so a “landing” would be made while the machine was still a few feet in the air, making the plane drop hard, incurring damage to the floats or other parts of the machine. Most pilots learned to overcome this “glassy water” hazard by coming over the landing area very low; then by giving the engine full power the slip stream from the propeller would ripple the water, and he would quickly swing around and make a landing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Skillful Flying</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Sometimes prospectors would ask to be taken in to very small lakes. This was always an extremely hazardous operation. Usually it was possible to get down all right, but the taking-off operation was the most difficult, due to the distance needed to get airborne when flying with floats. In such cases a pilot would take the plane to the farthest end of the lake and then would finally just scrape the treetops at the other end of the lake as he soared into the air. In one such instance the pilot tied the tail of his plane to a tree on the shore by a short length of rope and had a man on the shore stand by with a razor-sharp hunting knife till he gave the signal to slash the rope. By the time the rope gave way the pilot had the engine roaring at almost full throttle and so the plane practically shot into the air!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One pilot probably saved the lives of two passengers, his mechanic and himself by a very skillful piece of .flying. While flying over Great Slave Lake, the mechanic noticed that the ski on the right side of the machine was hanging straight down. The shock cord on the front of the ski, which usually keeps it tilted slightly upward, had given way. This machine was equipped with radio, so the pilot contacted the base at Yellowknife to be prepared with fire extinguishers and other crash equipment. The two passengers were instructed to roll themselves up in eider-down sleeping bags. The pilot kept circling the landing area until most of the fuel was gone and then decided to make as good a landing as possible on the one good ski. He cut the engine and put the plane into a side-slip at the same time in order to reduce forward speed. This action released the pressure from the slip stream, and to the joy of the watching mechanic, the troublesome ski slowly came up to a level position. The mechanic yelled to the pilot, who dropped the plane onto the ice to make an almost perfect three-point landing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were other usual hazards, such as fog, freezing rain, blizzards and landings on rough ice in the winter. Most of these have now been overcome by means of radio beacons, de-icing equipment on planes, accurate weather forecasts and twoway voice communication. Bush pilots today are seldom out of touch with their bases and most airplanes are now equipped with all the latest aids to safe flying. The rough-ice hazard will likely remain; time and again it has caused the metal surface on the bottom of the skis to be torn, or the ski itself to be broken, and shock absorbers and propellers have come in for their share of damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through the years of bush flying, men and machines have accomplished one of the world’s greatest transportation jobs. Thousands of passengers were carried into the new mining fields of Great Bear Lake and Yellowknife and other areas across Canada’s north country. Thousands of tons of freight were moved, including every conceivable type of mining equipment, ore concentrates, gold bricks, dynamite, coal, oil-well drilling equipment, furs, foodstuffs and other things found necessary to make living in northern regions comfortable. It was through bush flying that the world’s longest and most northerly airmail route up to that time was inaugurated in December, 1929, with a shipment of five tons of mail, including 125,000 letters destined for fur posts along the Mackenzie River and down to the Arctic Ocean. Delivery was accomplished by an armada of four aircraft, which left Fort McMurray early in December and finally all returned by early January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Most bush fliers of that time were quiet and reserved individuals. Even though newspapers often praised them in glowing words for daring and spectacular flights, yet these men would pass the whole matter off by saying: “We were just doing our job. It was all in the day’s work.” Most of the time they would give the credit to the mechanics who flew with them and faced up to emergencies with courage, determination and co-operation. Such loyalty on the part of the mechanics, who were often referred to as “the black gang,” was greatly responsible for making northern bush flying so free from fatal accidents in those years.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Emergency Repairs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Repairing planes on northern lakes and rivers or on the barren stretches of the Arctic coast was no easy job in summer or in winter. There were no machine shops or well-equipped hangars in those out-of-the-way places. In summer mechanics would often have to make engine or aircraft body or float repairs while fighting off myriads of mosquitoes, black flies and the famous northern “bulldog” (larger than a horsefly and twice as bloodthirsty). In winter he would make repairs while contending with biting Arctic winds and with temperatures as low as 70 degrees below zero. It was not possible to make intricate repairs with gloves on, so most of the work had to be done with bare hands, stopping at times to heat the handles of wrenches in order to alleviate the cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An example of mechanical resourcefulness was demonstrated during the search for the lost MacAIpine party in 1929. A plane came down on the rough ice of Bathurst Inlet and wiped off its undercarriage. Repairs were made to the point where only one steel bolt was necessary to make it airworthy again. Undaunted, the mechanics went to work and made one from the handle of a wrench, using just a hammer and a file to fashion it from one of the toughest pieces of steel known. The bolt fit, the plane took off and made the trip back to civilization successfully. During this same vast search a plane broke a short strut; a serviceable replacement was made from the handle of a frying pan! A magneto was repaired with a piece of wire from an old radio set, and compression struts for seaplane floats were repaired by cutting off the top of a steel wireless mast!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the best-known repair jobs in the annals of bush flying was accomplished in 1921, the year that bush flying in Canada was bom. Two all-metal Junkers aircraft were on their way to Fort Norman, the center of a rich oil strike the previous summer. At Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie River the machines cracked up. The fliers were anxious to get back “outside” before the spring breakup came, so it was decided to repair the plane that was least damaged. All repairs were made successfully except for the most important part— the propeller! What to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An old cabinetmaker at the Hudson Bay Post came to the rescue with the suggestion that they make one! Oaken sleigh runners were selected, rubbed smooth, glued with glue made from moose hides and hoofs and then clamped together with old ship’s clamps. Painstakingly the blades were fashioned, using as a pattern the unbroken end of one of the original propellers. The hub was drilled out, holes for the propeller boss were drilled and then it was balanced on the edge of a hunting knife after being finished and dressed with oil. Now for the final test.' Would it pull a two-ton plane through the air at a hundred miles an hour a.distance of eight hundred miles to Edmonton? Would it do its work without vibration at 1,500 rpm while being turned by a 175-horsepower engine? The answer to all these questions came exactly nineteen days after the crack-up. The machine took to the air and flew to Edmonton without a mishap! Later the propeller was tested and found equal to any factory-made job!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What made men take up this occupation of bush flying? Perhaps some would call it “the lure of the north.” But some of these bush fliers might tell you that they had the same vision as a poet of earlier times who wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales.” </span><span class="font0">Others enjoyed the adventure of these flying operations and the element of danger that went with them. Still others went into it to satisfy an urge to find out what kind of country existed where the maps showed the large white spots marked “Unexplored area.” So with these urges satisfied, and the job of opening Canada’s north accomplished, many of these veterans of bush flying turned the controls over to younger hands and became top executives of Canada’s leading airlines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even though giant liners now roar across polar skies, making scheduled trips to other continents, and Canada’s Northwest Territories have regularly scheduled flights down the Mackenzie River and into Yellowknife and other places, bush flying still has its place. Men still want to be transported to lonely trap lines, and others to out-of-the-way mineral strikes. People still get sick in far-off trading posts and need to be flown to a hospital. Supplies must be flown to mining camps off the beaten track. So while all these things have to be done, a younger generation of bush fliers will carry on, without doubt benefiting much from the experience gained by veterans of former years.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN BEARS GO FISHING</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Writing in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The National Geographic Magazine,</span><span class="font17"> Cecil E. Rhode describes how the huge brown bears of Alaska fish for salmon: “Like humans, these bears had their own individual theories about the best way to catch fish. Some sat on the dry bedrock close to swirling waters and waited. When a salmon darted in close, out shot a paw and pinned it down for sharp teeth to seize. Others stood in the stream closer to their quarry. One old male would walk slowly into the river, turn, and sit down with his back to the current, letting it boil up over his shoulders. There is no doubt m my mind that salmon took him for a natural obstruction in the white water and found refuge, fleeting as it was, in the eddy formed by his huge body. An almost effortless nod of his big head produced a meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“There were two fancy divers in the crowd. These fellows ran from the shore or shallows in a burst of speed, took a long, gliding plunge, and submerged. Though they often came up with fish, their purpose seemed more to be fun than food. There was, Fm sorry to report, another kind of fisherman. Having tried various methods and failed in all, he would sneak around and make off with his neighbor’s catch. One fishing practice common to all was silence.

<p><span class="font17">“I remember once feeding an electric eel that lived in a large tank in a zoo,” says naturalist Gerald Durrell in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Encounters with Animals,</span><span class="font17"> “and it was quite fascinating to watch his method of dealing with his prey. He was about five feet long and could cope adequately with a fish of about eight or ten inches in length. These had to be fed to him alive, and as their death was instantaneous, f had no qualms about this. The eel seemed to know when it was feeding-time and he would be patrolling his tank with the mo-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">’ notonous regularity of a sentry outside Buckingham Palace, As soon as a fish was dropped into his tank he would freeze instantly and apparently watch it as it swam closer and closer. When it was within range, which was about a foot or so, he would suddenly appear to quiver all over as if a dynamo had started within his long dark length. The fish would be, as it were, frozen in its tracks; it was dead before you realised that anything was happening, and then very slowly it would tilt over and start floating belly uppermost. The eel would move a little closer, open his mouth and suck violently, and, as though he were an elongated vacuum-cleaner, the fish would disappear into him.”</span></p>

As careful of her complexion as are beauty-conscious women all over the world, the Guajira paints her face with a red or black substance applied on a sheepfat base on a line just below the eyes down to the point of the chin. The unmarried girl decorates her face with designs of circles and swirls in various colors, serving the threefold purpose of protecting her skin against the burning sunrays reflected from the hot sands, adorning her face and supplying a very graceful adornment. The hand-woven purses, again in bold design and bright materials, that the men love to swing from their belts are also the product of the skilled hands of their women.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Family Traditions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">An outstanding characteristic of these Indians is that each family is a tightly knit group, wherein all successes and failures are shared. If one commits an offense against another, the whole family of the guilty one feels responsible and helps to right the wrong. This is understandable in the light of the tradition that an offended family can take revenge against any member of an offender’s family. Families are divided into twenty-five or thirty clans, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">castas,</span><span class="font0"> and all foreigners are considered as belonging to one clan. For this reason, some years ago, white men did not dare enter Guajiro territory for fear they would be killed for the crime of another white man. Among Guajiros, blood is paid for with blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The head of the Guajiro household is the maternal uncle. The husband always belongs to his mother’s family and plays an active role in it, but he does not count in the family of his wife. Even the children bear their mother’s family name. A husband is allowed several wives, if he can afford them, but the bride price ranges up to 12,000 Bolivars (approximately $3,000), or forty steers or ten cows with their calves. If the bride price is very high the prospective husband’s family will contribute toward it too. Marriage is indissoluble except for adultery on the part of the wife; in this event the bride price is repaid to the husband, who also has charge of the children of the marriage, and the wife is divorced. If it is thought her adultery was in part due to her husband’s cruel treatment of her, only one child goes to the father and a proportion of the bride price originally paid. In this case her family can collect the price again, this time from her seducer, and demand that he marry her.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Climatic Conditions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, these were an agricultural people who loved to hunt their meat; but with the introduction of domestic cattle, stock raising has become their principal occupation, and their herds now comprise over 150,000 animals and include goats, sheep, horses and burros. Living in a land that can boast of only one constantly flowing river, the Guajiros are for the most part a nomadic people and prove themselves to be tireless walkers and expert horsemen. For a permanent dwelling in good pastures, a simple thatched hut is soon made, but when roaming with their flocks, they are content to have a clump of bushes for a roof. Stakes are driven for their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chinchorros,</span><span class="font0"> or open-weave hammocks, a cactus fence is set up around the cook fire and then after two or three days stakes are pulled again for the trek to the next pasture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Have you ever eaten boiled cactus? The chances are that you will never have to do so, but for the Guajiros in times of drought this may become a necessity. In normal circumstances, the food of these Indians will differ very little from the usual Venezuelan menu of bananas, sweet potatoes, various roots and animal flesh, including that of wild animals when available. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chicha,</span><span class="font0"> a fermented drink of com or cactus leaves, is a common drink, and a great amount of beer and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aguardiente,</span><span class="font0"> or cane liquor, is consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Normally the months of drought alternate with short periods of flood, but the dry seasons have been so severe during the past few years that thousands of these people have been forced to migrate to Maracaibo, the colorful second city of Venezuela, in order to get enough to eat. It has been a tragically common sight to see a Guajira woman, maybe with a child by her side, begging from car to car, bar to bar or house to house for food or money. It is encouraging to know that wells and watering places are now being developed under the direction of the Venezuelan authorities, as there is no doubt that good husbandry with modern methods of water conservation and agriculture will do much in the immediate future to alleviate the hardships brought upon the Guajiros by the unpredictable natural elements.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Religious Influence</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">It is to be expected that the traditional religion of the land would express itself in a god who would manifest himself in rain and sun. This is so, and the deity called Mareigua is worshiped as an invisible supreme being and creator of everything visible. The history of a great flood covering the whole earth is also embodied in their religious teachings, and their beliefs include that of an undying soul, which, it is claimed, lives outside the body and at death goes far away. It is therefore not difficult for some to embrace the so-called Christian religions holding a similar belief, as has in fact happened. Interestingly enough, however, in their primitive worship the Guajiros are not idol worshipers, and images have never been found in examination of their relics from before the advent of Roman Catholicism to their land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although the Bible book of Mark is the only part of the Holy Bible at present available in the Guajiro language, many are being helped to study it. During the dry season when some ten to twelve thousand Guajiros migrate to the suburbs of Maracaibo, ministers from one of the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses in the city take the opportunity to visit them frequently, before they return to their own land, and to conduct Bible studies with them with the aid of Spanish-language Bible helps. As the Guajiros themselves take back to their own people the good news of God’s kingdom that they have heard, this preaching work expands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Good progress is also being made in increasing literacy, with schools staffed by bilingual Guajiro teachers, operating under the care of the Venezuelan government. Although the Guajiro language is difficult to master, it has been proved that it is best to teach reading and writing first in this native tongue and later in Spanish. Large-print illustrated primers have been prepared by the Indigene Commission, with a Guajiro-Spanish dictionary in course of preparation for future use. The Guajiros are certainly beginning to feel the effects of their closer association with all those who are endeavoring to help them and they look confidently to continued progress in the future, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">T</span><span class="font0">HE afternoon sun was sinking low in the western sky on what had been a spring day of unusual beauty. Even the guns on the front lines near Ypres, Belgium, had been relatively quiet that afternoon of April 22, 1915. Then, suddenly, about five o'clock, the peaceful calm was shattered by an appalling outburst of cannon fire from the German lines. It was soon followed by something unprecedented in warfare. As the Allied troops watched unsuspectingly from their trenches, an ominous bank of vapor emerged from the direction of the German lines and, driven along by a gentle breeze, moved swiftly toward them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sir Arthur C. Doyle in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Great</span><span class="font0"> War described what followed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“The French troops, staring over the top of their parapet at this curious screen which ensured them a temporary relief from fire, were observed suddenly to throw up their hands, to clutch at their throats, and to fall to the ground in the agonies of asphyxiation. Many lay where they had fallen, while their comrades, absolutely helpless against this diabolical agency, rushed madly out of the mephitic mist and made for the rear, over-running the lines of trenches behind them. Many of them never halted until they had reached Ypres, while others rushed westwards and put the canal between themselves and the enemy. The Germans, meanwhile, advanced, and took possession of the successive lines of trenches, tenanted only by the dead garrisons, whose blackened faces, contorted figures, and lips fringed with the blood and foam from their bursting lungs, showed the agonies in which they had died.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19610922_files/g_E_19610922-9.png" alt="" style="width:269pt;height:273pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">Surprised and unprepared, the troops were terrorized by this sinister vapor of death. As a result the casualties numbered some 15,000, of which 5,000 died. To the few chemists on the battlefield the gas was not something new or mystical—they immediately recognized it as chlorine, a gas familiar to any chemistry student. Soon troops were equipped with gas masks that afforded full protection against chlorine as well as against the other much more toxic lung-irritants that eventually came into use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was on the night of July 12, 1917, on the same Flanders field near Ypres, that a new type of gas again took the Allies completely by surprise and struck terror into their hearts. Exploding shells sprinkled and sprayed them with a liquid having a mustard or horse-radish smell. Since there was no immediate pain to the eyes or skin, the troops did not at first recognize it as dangerous. Suspicious of the smell, many put on their masks, yet never thinking to protect their eyes or other parts of their bodies. Within seven hours many were blind, some never recovering their sight. Others were severely burned, several layers of their skin being eaten away. Since mustard gas does not attack the sensory nerves, irreparable damage was done before the men realized what was happening. Completely unprepared to meet such an attack, the Allies were terrorized and suffered heavy casualties.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Still Unprepared</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Down till today people throughout the world have a particular aversion to chemical warfare—it terrifies them. Major General Marshall Stubbs, chief of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, said that reports regarding the gas attacks are largely responsible: “We were horrified—and we made sure the rest of the world was properly horrified—when the Germans introduced mustard gas in World War I.” Again during the Korean war the Communists utilized public opinion to launch a successful propaganda program, to the effect that the United States was using germ weapons. No doubt to avoid giving credence to these Soviet accusations, as well as fear that people might be too frightened if they learned of their potency, the public has not been informed on the recent developments in chemical, biological and radiological weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But one might ask, Why pursue the development of such terrorizing weapons of death? General Stubbs explained the viewpoint apparently held by many of the military leaders: “The surest way to deter anyone from using them on us is to develop a CB arsenal so strong no one will dare force retaliation.” Russia is known to be far ahead of the United States in stockpiling these weapons, and some time ago Khrushchev indicated that they would be used in event of war. Under such circumstances the only alternative is to match the Soviet Union in the development and production of these weapons, so it is argued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some will point to what happened during World War II. When the Allied forces invaded Germany they found stored in warehouses tons of newly developed nerve gases. Hitler considered using them, but decided against it. Why? Although it is a matter still debated by military historians, it is argued that a major reason was fear of retaliation. He did not realize that the Allies did not have a comparable lethal weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore many military leaders call for increased activity in preparing these weapons and for educating the people concerning their use. Richard Morse, U.S. Army director of research and development, said that “there is an urgent need for public awareness of chemical and biological warfare,” and that “some kind of an educational program, both for the public and for service personnel,” is needed. Brigadier General Fred J. Delmore, Chemical Corps research and development chief, also urged such a program, for he pointed out “that if chemical and biological weapons are used, there is no possibility of the civilian population being spared.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Today’s Weapons of Terror</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The public hears much concerning nuclear bombs but knows little about chemical and biological weapons. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font0"> of April 16, 1960, compared their destructive potential: “The latest chemical or biological warfare agents, carried in a single bomber, could kill more people than an H-bomb. At this moment the U.S. population has virtually no means of protecting itself in the initial stages of the attack,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What are chemical and biological weapons? What is meant by CB or CBR warfare, which we frequently hear about today? Are these weapons really as potent as some people say? Can they be effectively employed in warfare? Is there any protection against them ? In view of the unrest in the world and the increasing possibility of war, it is only proper that we should want to know about such weapons and how we might best be protected against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CBR warfare stands for chemical, biological and radiological warfare. Chemical warfare involves the using of toxic chemical agents, such as the poisonous gases that were used in the first world war. Biological refers to life or living things; biological warfare is the applying of living organisms such as germs, bacteria and toxic substances produced by them for use in war. Sometimes it is referred to as germ or bacteriological warfare. Radiological warfare is the using of radioactive substances in war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tremendous strides have been made in the development of these silent, sinister weapons of death. During the second world war the German scientists were able to design nerve gases that would cause the muscles of the body, including those affecting the lungs and heart, to tighten up in rigid paralysis. Death followed in a matter of minutes. At the end of the war the German factories, which were turning out tons of these gases, were taken over by the Allies and Russians. Since then both sides have continued research and manufacture of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Today nerve gases can be delivered by ocean-traversing missiles to be dispersed over a distant population in the form of vapor or as an aerosol. Gas masks would be needed for protection, as well as special clothing, since the aerosol mist would penetrate ordinary clothing and be absorbed through the skin. Atropine, apparently still the most effective antidote, would have to be injected almost immediately in order to overcome the fatal effects of the poison. Science </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">News Letter</span><span class="font0"> of March 16, 1957, commented that “if a nerve gas attack ever hit this country, two to three minutes are all the time you will have to save your life from something you cannot see, feel, or smell . . . military and civil defense experts know all too well that we are virtually defenseless against it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The field of chemical warfare now includes psychochemicals that do not kill but merely cause irrational behavior. Other chemicals referred to as “incapacitants&quot; are capable of causing temporary blindness, paralysis, loss of equilibrium, and in other ways interfere with a person’s ability to fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some respects biological weapons present a more terrifying prospect than chemicals. Germs that can infect a population with typhoid fever, bubonic plague, tuberculosis, smallpox, yellow fever and many other diseases can be spread over thousands of miles of enemy territory. They could be delivered to location by missiles, causing epidemics that would spread terror among the people. According to LeRoy D. Fothergill, special adviser to the U.S. Army Biological Laboratory: “The overt means of dissemination is aerosol spray in a biological cloud that is invisible, odorless and tasteless. . . . The infection of an entire continent by biological clouds is possible under proper meteorological conditions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Just a small package can carry incredibly dangerous amounts of these germs. Brigadier General J. H. Rothschild, retired as Commanding General of the Chemical Corps Research and Development Command, gave an example: “A single ounce of the toxic agent which causes the disease called ‘Q fever’ would be sufficient to infect </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">28 billion</span><span class="font0"> people.” A report claims that British scientists have developed botulinum toxin to the point where a pound would be enough to “unpeople the world, destroy all animal life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The terrorizing effect of radiation was dramatically drawn to public notice when, in 1954, Japanese fishermen were sprinkled With radioactive ashes of death originating from a nuclear explosion many miles away. Radiological war would employ such radioactive materials, which can easily be produced in other ways besides a nuclear explosion. Radioactive cobalt is one of the deadliest of materials and can be produced in huge quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the greatest of secrecy the contending powers are working on the neutron bomb. Theoretically this bomb, instead of producing heat and blast, would create a burst of neutrons that would spray down on a population, penetrate buildings, and when reaching humans would kill by deforming and destroying body cells. This is why it is referred to as the “death ray” bomb. Some suggest that Russia may already have this terrorizing radiological weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Military leaders praise CBR warfare as ''practical,” for it would kill or incapacitate a population and yet leave property standing and intact. But how practical is warfare capable of destroying every living thing on the face of the earth? What kind of logic is it to prepare for war if you want peace? Preparation for war has always meant war! For the first time in history the nations are feverishly preparing for a war that nobody can hope to win; it would be mutual suicide. Knowledgeable leaders and people throughout the world realize this, and quake with fear.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Disarmament Is Man’s Only Hope</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">What is the solution? Disarmament is recognized, advocated, talked about for untold hours at conference tables, but never heeded by the nations of this world. Why? Fear. Fear that other nations will not keep the agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Proposed inspections to control armaments become meaningless with the advent of CBR warfare. The testing of neutron bombs would be almost as hard to detect as the explosion of a few sticks of dynamite. All bacteriological laboratories would have to be closed down, for it would be next to impossible to keep a check on whether they were making biological weapons or not. The chemical industry would also have to go, for how could a foreign nation know for sure that a fiendish weapon was not being slipped into the production schedule of some chemical plant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What, then, is needed? There must be a willing rejection of the idea of war. For people to disarm, there must be an atmosphere of mutual trust and love. This has been attained among hundreds of thousands of people who have come out of all nations and become a part of the New World society of Jehovah's witnesses. In obedience to God’s command they have beaten their swords into plowshares and have completely rejected the idea of lifting up weapons against their fellow man. The nations will never willingly do this. However, soon, at the fast-approaching war of Armageddon, Jehovah will forceably disarm the nations by destroying them along with their weapons. So rejoice, all you peace-loving people of the earth, for total disarmament is close at hand! A new world of righteousness will follow, where weapons that terrorize will be a thing of the past.—Mic. 4:3, 4; Ps. 46:8, 9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">C</span><span class="font0">AN you imagine spending all your time, day by day, month by month, for the duration of your life, desperately trying to sweep away and dispose of an everincreasing accumulation of the countless millions of tons of leaves, grass and other forms of dead plant life that fall to the earth each year? Such a monotonous, persistent drudgery is a very dismal prospect, you will agree, but can you further envisage the grim possibility of the suffocation of all forms of earthly life? Is this fiction? No, because all forms of life on this planet would conceivably be smothered out of existence if it were not for the unrelenting and unceasing activities of fungi and their working companions, bacteria. Such would be a world without fungi. Consider the reasons why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First of all, do you think of fungi as plants? Probably not, because fungi are completely devoid of the green color that is commonly associated with plants, but in many other ways there are basic similarities and so they are accurately described as such. But what is this green pigment that is missing from fungi plants? Do you know what part it plays in the wealth of other vegetation that beautifies our earth and how fungi exist without it? In the anform carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide, the latter being readily absorbed from the atmosphere. This complex process, called photosynthesis, is accomplished by the action of the very substance that gives plants their green color—chlorophyll. By means of this these plants are able to build up organic compounds that are essential for their own growth. Due to a total lack of chlorophyll, fungi face the prodigious task of obtaining the same foods, which are just as necessary for their own existence, by some other means. Since they are unable to photosynthesize, they must rely on their being able to consume organic matter that is already in existence. This they are ideally suited to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fungi can be divided into two groups, the majority being classed as saprophytes. These feed exclusively on dead organic matter, whereas the minority, called parasites, get their food from living organisms, including animals and man, as well as from plants. There are some species that can exist by feeding on either dead or living organisms and others that grow on fellow fungi, but these are less common. In any of these ways the fungus can assimilate the food that it needs, and when this is exhausted it dies. As each fungoid growth does so, it leaves behind a depleted and therefore decaying food source that is attacked time and again by different forms of fungi, each able to feed on remaining substances, until eventually the original organic debris is broken down beyond recognition. The disposal work is thus accomplished!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this way vital supplies of mineral wealth that would otherwise be trapped and lie dormant indefinitely in the dead organic structures are quickly broken down and either assimilated by the fungi or released directly for the benefit of other plant life, the remaining valuable matter, called humus, being left to build up the fertility of the soil. Additionally, carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere to be used again in the process of photosynthesis. A constant supply of this gas is essential, not only for plant life, but also for use in animal and human respiration, and it is generally acknowledged that the organic breakdown provided by fungi and bacteria keeps this essential process in balance, providing the greater part of the carbon dioxide needed. With these facts in mind, we can see that fungi make no small contribution to the continued existence of earthly life.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Fungi Fruits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Did you know that a mushroom is not a plant itself, but rather the fruit of a fungus plant and that its existence marks the end of the life cycle of the fungus? The plant actually consists of a series of very fine threads that grow and intertwine and mat in or on whatever substance is supporting its growth. This is called a mycelium or spawn by mushroom growers. After a period of time, small balls, or growths, begin to appear upon various parts of it and these eventually develop into cases to bear the seeds, called spores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The so-called fairy rings, so commonly seen in fields, are really the outward evidence of the existence of mycelia in the soil. As the spawn grows, it does so equally from the spot where the spore fell and, as the mushrooms are usually produced at the extremity of the growth, a ring is formed. This process continues to take place outside the ring, the inside area being depleted of the food necessary to sustain its growth, and thus the strange fairy ring continues to grow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the case of mushrooms, these quickly push above the ground on stalks to form the umbrella-shaped structures that are so well known, the spores being contained in the underside gill-like formations. Puffballs, on the other hand, develop from ground level, sometimes to enormous proportions, and the spores are ejected in dustlike clouds from their apex; hence their name. In complete contrast, the numerous molds and slime fungi, some of which can cause so much damage to crops and foods, as well as to wooden buildings m the form of dry rot, often have fruiting bodies that cannot be seen clearly by the naked eye but that operate in similar ways. With thousands of known species and probably an equal number as yet unclassified, there is certainly no lack of variety in this strange creation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Food for All</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">For many people, mushrooms as a food are an exquisite delight, but for others, perhaps the majority, the fear of being poisoned overshadows any attempt to step beyond the realm of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agaricus campestris, </span><span class="font0">the well-known common field mushroom. However, in the British Isles alone it has been estimated that there are in fact hundreds of edible kinds of mushrooms and really only a handful of highly poisonous ones, mainly of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amanita</span><span class="font0"> family, and the same is also true of other parts of the world. Before ever thinking of eating any of the unknown varieties, however, it is essential that one of the many good books available on mushroom identification be consulted. There is positively no alternative to proper identification. The inflexible rule is: If in doubt, do not touch, let alone eat! Mushroom poisoning is serious and by the deadly </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amanita</span><span class="font0"> species is quite often fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bread, wine, beer and various cheeses depend upon different actions of fungi to bring about the desired results, and it is an established fact that the use of yeast and other molds has been known to man since the earliest records of history. Over 400 years before the Israelites left Egypt in 1513 B.C. carrying “their flour dough before it was leavened” the Bible tells us that Lot “baked unfermented cakes,” which is a clear indication that fermentation was practiced then.—Ex. 12:34; Gen. 19:3.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Penicillin</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Since such ancient times, men are also on record as having made numerous attempts to use fungi for medicinal purposes, and rye ergot is a drug still used for obstetric purposes. In our own times a major breakthrough in the combating of infection was made in the year 1928. Then it' was that Dr. Alexander Fleming began his famous experiments with a green fungus mold that had grown on a bacteria culture from a spore blown in by chance through the window of his laboratory in St Margaret’s Hospital, London. The fact that the bacteria were inhibited in the immediate presence of the mold caused him to conduct tests and experiments, resulting in the identifying of the mold as of the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Penicillium.</span><span class="font0"> The powerful antibiotic produced, together with others subsequently developed, have been understandably termed “wonder drugs.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much has been written on the activities of different fungi species and there is much more to be learned and fully understood. Whatever modem research may yet discover, enough is now known to establish beyond any doubt the great and lasting value of fungi in the pattern of earthly creation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&quot;By smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, a pregnant woman may double her chances of having a smaller, or premature, baby,” reported the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">.Medical World News</span><span class="font17"> magazine of March 31, 1961. “The finding comes from the first large-scale ‘prospective’ survey on the subject, directed by Todd Frazier, head of the bureau of biostatistics of the Baltimore City Health Department. He enlisted the cooperation of 2,735 Negro women at the Baltimore Health Department prenatal clinic; to eliminate possible bias, he interviewed them during, rather than after, pregnancy. . . . Results of the study . . . showed that the rate of ‘prematurity’ for 1,563 nonsmokers was 11.2 per cent, compared to 18.6 per cent for 960 smokers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The incidence of prematurity, says Frazier, shows an increase proportional to the amount smoked—from the low of 11 per cent among non smokers, to a high of 22.9 for women who smoked more than a pack a day. . . .

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Jj </span><span class="font0">graven images of her gods he has broken to the earth!&quot; &quot;Babylon, the decoration of kingdoms, the beauty of the pride of the Chaldeans, must become as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. She will never be inhabited, nor will she reside for generation after generation.” So prophesied Isaiah nearly two hundred years before Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians and a hundred years before she became a mighty world power. —Isa. 21:9; 13:19, 20..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prophet Jeremiah also spoke of Jehovah’s judgments against Babylon. He declared: “This is what Jehovah has said: *... I will dry up her sea, and I will make her wells dry. And Babylon must become piles of stones, the lair of jackals, an object of astonishment and something to whistle at, without an inhabitant.’ ”—Jer. 51:36,37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It must have required a deep conviction of God’s absolute foreknowledge on the part of the Hebrew prophets to publish Babylon’s downfall abroad, for Babylon was &quot;the beauty of the pride of the Chaldeans,” “Mistress of Kingdoms,” who kept saying: “To time indefinite I shall prove to be Mistress, forever.’’—Isa. 13:19; 47: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Despite her boasts, ancient Babylon is no more. It is worth while to consider the principal points of these prophecies concerning Babylon’s fate, that we might have our faith upbuilt by the sure word of prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prophecies show (1) that Babylon’s lofty walls were to be torn down (Jer. 50: 15; 51:44, 58); (2) that Babylon was not to present an appearance merely of a ruined city, but to “become piles of stones” (Jer. 51:37); (3) that there was to be an absolute loss of inhabitants (Isa. 13:20); (4) that she was to become &quot;a waterless land and a desert plain,” yet “a possession of porcupines and reedy pools of water” (Jer. 51:43; Isa. 14:23); (5) and that “there the haunters of waterless regions will certainly lie down, and their houses must be filled with eagle owls. . . . And jackals must howl in her dwelling towers, and the big snake will be in the palaces of exquisite delight.”—Isa. 13:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As in the past so today travelers are always astonished at the complete ruin of Babylon. Babylon’s walls are torn down and the city is nothing but heaps of stones. Sir Austen Layard, excavator of Nineveh, in his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nineveh and Babylon</span><span class="font0"> refers to Babylon as a site of unsightly mounds, some smaller, some larger—“shapeless heaps of rubbish.” Sir Robert Ker Porter, painter and traveler, in his book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Travels </span><span class="font0">says the ancient ruins resemble “natural hills in appearance.” The walls that, according to Herodotus, once towered some 344 feet high and 86 feet wide have been destroyed. Sir Layard writes: “It is more difficult to explain the total absence of all traces of the external wall and ditch so fully and minutely described by Herodotus and other ancient writers, and, according to their concurrent accounts, of such enormous dimensions. ... it is scarcely to be believed that no part whatever of it should now remain.” How true the prophetic declarations!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prophets stated that Babylon would be without inhabitant. Babylon’s location was well chosen; for that feason it would seem only reasonable that people would cling to it. But Babylon was to be emptied of her inhabitants, said the prophets. “There the Arab will not pitch his tent, and no shepherds will let their flocks lie down there.” (Isa. 13:20) Strabo, the Greek geographer, writes: “The great city had become a great solitude.” Modern travelers marvel at the emptiness and solitude of Babylon. Not a single modern building can be seen on the ancient site. Babylon remains as a tomb, empty and silent. George Rawlinson, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Egypt and Babylon,</span><span class="font0"> says: “On the actual ruins of Babylon the Arabian neither pitches his tent nor pastures his flocks—in the first place, because the nitrous soil produces no pasture to tempt him; and secondly, because an evil reputation attaches to the entire site, which is thought to be the haunt of evil spirits.” The point is that God’s Word has proved true: the Arab neither pitches his tent nor feeds his flock there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At first glance Jeremiah and Isaiah appear to have made conflicting statements about Babylon. Jeremiah said that Babylon was to become “a waterless land and a desert plain.” On the other hand, Isaiah said it would become “a possession of porcupines and reedy pools of water.” However, this paradox is exactly in keeping with what took place. Various historians are of the opinion that Babylon’s enemies destroyed the artificial lakes and reservoirs that King Nebuchadnezzar had built and allowed the water to sweep over Babylon like a sea. Even the course of the Euphrates River was changed. Survivors deserted the city. The neglected canals soon deteriorated into pools and marshes. The city, without water, soon crumbled to dust. Ker Porter says his eyes could see nothing but “vast irregular hills of earth,” that “every spot of ground in sight was totally barren.” Sir Layard says of Babylon, it has become “a naked and hideous waste.” But west of Babylon, says Ker Porter, the land is “very low and swampy. . . . large deposits of the waters are left stagnant in the hollows between the ruins.” “From the summit of the Bins Nimroud,&quot; Layard observes, “I gazed over a vast marsh, for Babylon is made ‘a possession for the bittern and pools of water.’ ” So there are waterless desert wastes as well as reedy pools of water, as the prophets declared. How keen the foresight of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prophecies also stated that Babylon’s houses “must be filled with eagle owls. . . . And jackals must howl in her dwelling towers, and the big snake will be in the palaces of exquisite delight.” (Isa. 13:21, 22) An observant traveler, the late Mr. Rich, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">First Memoir,</span><span class="font0"> writes: “In most of the cavities of the Babil mound, there are numbers of bats and owls.” Sir Layard declares; “A large gray owl is found in great numbers—frequently in flocks of nearly a hundred—in the low shrubs among the ruins of Babylon,” As for wild beasts, Rich states: “There are many dens of wild beasts in various parts.” Ker Porter reports that the place has become “the refuge of jackals and other savage animals.” Jehan de Mandeville, compiler of a singular book of travels, tells us that in his day (1322) the site of Babylon was ‘full of dragons and great serpents.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Anyone visiting Babylon today is compelled to admit that the prophetic declarations have been accomplished even in minute particulars. Babylon’s desolation stands as testimony that God’s Word is truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">On August 9, speaking at a Kremlin reception honoring the second Soviet astronaut, Major Titov, Khrushchev warned that any nation attacking the Soviet Union would be committing suicide. He said that Russia had the capability of building a rocket with an explosive warhead equivalent to 100,000,000 tons of TNT, and that in the event of war they would utilize all weapons at their disposal. Such a 100-megaton weapon would be 5,000 times more powerful than the one that wiped out some 75,000 lives at Hiroshima.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">&lt;§&gt; The electrical heat of lightning causes the nitrogen of the air to combine with oxygen, forming nitrogen oxide. This comes down with the rain and reacts with minerals in the soil to form plant-nourishing nitrates. Researchers estimate that each year some 100 million tons of nitrates are thus formed. Figuring their value at $300 a ton, that means lightning is worth $30 billion a year.</span></p>

Metal crowns shaped like a cow's teeth are filled with a cement mixture, and by thus capping the teeth bossy can eat properly again. Veterinarians at the University of Illinois are going to study the idea in detail during a five-year experimental program. Under certain conditions mature cows become worthless within three years, for sand in sandy pastures or acid from beet-pulp diets ean wear their teeth away.</span></p>

We are a democracy and we are at the moment committed (in the last extremity) to order a clean-cut young American to kill 10,000,000 people in 15 minutes—-the load of one Polaris.”</span></p>
