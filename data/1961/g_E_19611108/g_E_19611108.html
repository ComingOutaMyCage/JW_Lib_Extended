<p><span class="font23">I</span><span class="font16">T IS natural for one to love him</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font16">self. In fact, there</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">would be something wrong with him if he did not. But at times this love of self causes one to err. It accounts for one’s resorting to shallow but apparently plausible reasons for what he did or wants to do. A modern name for this kind of self-deception is “rationalizing.” While this term has many technical meanings, its most common meaning is: “to devise superficially rational, or plausible, explanations or excuses (for one’s acts, beliefs, desires, etc.,) usually without being aware that they are not the real motives.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The lower animals do not rationalize, for they have neither the capacity for reason nor a conscience whose prickings cause one to rationalize. But men, even men without knowledge of God’s law, indulge in it— they make excuses for themselves—as the apostle Paul shows; They “demonstrate the matter of the law to be written in their hearts, while their conscience is bearing witness with them and, between their own thoughts, they are being accused or even excused.”—Rom. 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How prone human nature is to rationalize can be seen by the plausible excuses</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">that children invent for wanting to do or not to do something. To their little minds these reasons are sound enough, but not so to mature minds. Rationalizing may therefore be said to be a sign of immaturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A clear-cut example of rationalizing is that furnished by subjects acting out posthypnotic suggestions. As is well known, a subject may be placed in a deep hypnotic trance and while in it be told that upon coming out of it he will do a certain thing, say, put on his overcoat when he sees the hypnotist rub his nose. The subject is </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ak</span><span class="font16">n assured that he will not remember having received this command, and then he is awakened. After a while the hypnotist rubs his nose and, sure enough, the subject finds himself distressed and can get no relief until he gets his overcoat and puts it on. But the room is warm and so there obviously is no reason for his putting on his overcoat. So he begins to rationalize. Asked why he did it, he will say that it was because he felt a chill, or he wanted to see how it fit, oft he wanted to attract attention—all plausible excuses to him, all apparently made in good faith, but all ra-tionalizings because he himself is not aware of the real reason, the posthypnotic suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Bible shows that Eve indulged in rationalization when presented with the temptation to eat of the forbidden fruit. She thought of reasons for doing what she wanted to do in spite of the prickings of her conscience: &quot;Consequently the woman saw that the tree’s fruit was good for food and that it was something to be longed for to the eyes, yes, the tree was desirable to look upon. So she began taking of its fruit and eating it.’’ The serpent having persuaded her, she thought of reasons for doing what she wanted to do.—Gen. 3:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">God’s Word also tells us how the lazy man rationalizes: &quot;The lazy one has said: 'There is a lion outside! In the midst of the public squares I shall be murdered.’ ” Yes, too lazy to leave his bed to go out to work, so he invents </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">excuses to</span><span class="font16"> remain inside.—Prov. 22:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Today there are many persons who do not want to obey the principles found in the Bible and so they rationalize. They say that they do not believe the Bible accounts of creation and the Flood; so they can give no weight to Bible principles. Or they rationalize that the Bible was written when people used oxcarts and so it cannot be applied in this jet or space age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Rationalizing takes on many forms. When we cannot get what we want and we use the proverbial excuse, “Sour grapes,” like the fox who could not reach certain grapes (that is, we did not really want it after all), then we are rationalizing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Or, if we have acted upon impulse we may then try to justify our course by plausible reasons. A salesman may flatter us, causing us to purchase s«nething that we did not need or could not afford. When questioned as to why we bought it, we give plausible reasons: it was a bargain, we needed something to bolster our ego, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another form of rationalization that is common involves deeds of chivalry. A man may flatter himself upon being courteous or chivalrous, but his wife may know that her husband would not have been so attentive had the recipient been a plain old woman!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On this subject a textbook discerningly states: “Rationalization is so prevalent a reaction to situations involving conflict that it cannot be regarded as abnormal. It is something excused on the ground that it reduces qualms of conscience or misgivings which all of us suffer from time to time. Some assert that ‘if we did not rationalize, we’d go crazy.’ There is at least a grain of truth in such assertions, but they are themselves largely rationalizations. There is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">no good substitute for </span><span class="font16">facing life squarely and meeting difficulties realistically.”—</span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Psychology,</span><span class="font16"> L. N. Munn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Helping us to face life realistically is the Bible, the Word of God. It shows human nature just as it is: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate, Who can know it? I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys [the deepest emotions], even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.&quot;—Jer. 17:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And that Guide also sets before us the ideal standard, the life of Jesus Christ, and gives us right governing principles. It helps us to avoid </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">rationalizing by teaching us to </span><span class="font16">reason. Pointing out its penetrating capacity and helping us to guard against selfdeception or rationalization, the apostle Paul wrote: “The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit [between what appear to be the motives, between what appears on the outside, and that which we actually are], and of joints and their marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.”—Heb. 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">W</span><span class="font16">HETHER your prayers are effective or useless depends to a great extent upon the things for which you pray. Perhaps you have discovered this without fully realizing it. It may be that you have prayed </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">to</span><span class="font16"> win when prizes have been given away at raffles or in contests, but despite , your prayers you lost Or you may have placed a wager on a horse, bought a lottery ticket or played bingo and prayed to win, only to end up losing. Possibly the one who did win was not as religious or respectable as you are. Has this puzzled you?</span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">THINGS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">Prayer is a means by which man can express worship and love for his Creator. The purpose of prayer is to communicate what is in your heart to the heavenly Father, humbly manifesting your dependence upon him and your interest in his purposes. “Trust in him at all times, O people. Before him pour out your heart.” (Ps. 62:8) When doing so you can properly ask for a number of things that are in harmony with his will.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

Do open your eyes and see our desolated conditions and the city that has been called by your name; for not according to our righteous acts are we letting our entreaties fall before you, but according to your many mercies. O Jehovah, do hear. O Jehovah, do forgive. O Jehovah, do pay attention and act. Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.”—Dan. 9:5, 8, 18, 19.</span></p>

In such competitions why should God favor one person above another? When a ball team prays before a game and wins, can it be said that God gave them the victory? What about the times when they pray and do not win?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Pointing out that many people have a wrong view of prayer, the Bible wj’it£iLjIam^-JSXQi£l. “You (jo ask, and ye</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">t ye receive not, be</span><span class="font16">cause you are aski</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">nsLfor.a wr</span><span class="font16">ong purpose, that, </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font16"> may expend it upon your cravin</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">gs for sensual pleasu</span><span class="font16">re.” (Jas. 4:3) The great Creator is not a god of chance. He is not the servant of man. He is not like the fabled jinni of Aladdin’s lamp, waiting to do man’s bidding. Persons who pray as if they think he is miss the entire purpose of prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Jerusalem, while the Israelites were still in captivity in Babylon, Daniel used prayer properly, making an effective request for right things. He poured out his heart to the heavenly Father, confessing the wrong the Israelites had done, acknowledging God’s righteousness, asking his forgiveness and requesting that his favor might shine once again upon the city of Jerusalem, where his sanctuary had been located. By desiring to see the rebuilding of that sanctuary Daniel had the honoring of Jehovah’s name and the advancement of his worship foremost in mind. His was not a selfish prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In heartfelt repentance Daniel confessed in prayer; “We have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly and rebelled; and there has been a turning aside from your commandments and from your judicial decisions. Jehovah, to us belongs the shame of face,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">This sincere prayer was answered by the release of the Israelites from captivity, by the rebuilding of Jehovah’s sanctuary at Jerusalem and by the reestablishing of his worship there. Daniel manifested the right attitude by expressing concern over the reproach that was coming upon Jehovah’s name. His effective prayer shows that God’s interests should predominate in a prayer and not the selfish interests of the one praying. Jesus made this evident in the model prayer he gave his followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When Jesus taught his followers the proper way to pray, he opened the prayer by putting the sanctifying of Jehovah’s name first. Like Daniel, he knew that effective prayer should show concern for the vindicating of God’s name against the reproach heaped upon it by the world. He said: “You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.’ ” What he placed a</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">s next i</span><span class="font16">n importance are things concerning God’s purposes. “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” In the remainder of the prayer personal things are asked for, such as daily bread, f</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">orgiveness of debts to God</span><span class="font16">, no</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">t beingTed into temptatio</span><span class="font16">n, and deliverance from the wicked one. These are right things for which to pray.—Matt. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Personal Needs</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Not all personal needs for which a person may pray make his prayer selfish and ineffective. In the model prayer Jesus showed that it is </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">proper to pray for t</span><span class="font16">he </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">daily food we need to</span><span class="font16"> keep alive. Asking for essential food, not luxuries or more than is needed, is a suitable prayer. In harmony with such prayers Jehovah’s blessing can be expected on sincere and honest efforts to obtain basic needs. But the request for such things should be made with the expressed desire to be of service to God. Aside from praying for basic material needs a person must continually </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">pray fo</span><span class="font16">r f</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">orgiveness of his</span><span class="font16"> sins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As Daniel confessed the sins of the Israelites to God in prayer, so we should confess our sins to God. It is important to seek his forgiveness for the sins we commit because of our imperfections and foolishness. “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9) Along with our prayer for forgiveness we can pr</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">operly, ask f</span><span class="font16">or str</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">ength to maint</span><span class="font16">ain integ</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">rity t</span><span class="font16">o God. It is not easy to hold fast to true^ worship and divine laws while living in an unrighteous world. Praying for stren</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">gth is</span><span class="font16"> praying for a right thing. “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that is readily to be found during distress</span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">es.” (Ps. 46:1)</span><span class="font16"> The same can be said of wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When Solomon prayed for wisdom it was granted to him. God was pleased that he asked for that rather than selfishly requesting material things. It is not the wisdom of the world that God gives to those asking for wisdom but the wisdom from above. He provides it through his written Word and through his theocratic organization. This is wisdom that satisfies a person’s spiritual need, guiding him along a path of life that is best for him in every way.—Prov. 2:1-9; Jas. 1:5; 3:17.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Praying for Others</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Repeated expressions by Bible writers point out the propriety of praying for other persons. The object is not to pray for the material prosperity of others or for miraculous cures but for them to be spiritually benefited and strengthened. In his letter to the Colossians, Paul said that he prayed for them to “be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment.” (Col. 1:9) To the Corinthians he said: “We pray to God that you may do nothing wrong.&quot; (2 Cor, 13:7) In his second letter to the</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Thessalonians he requested them to pray for him and his traveling companions. “Finally, brothers, carry on prayer for us, that the word of Jehovah may keep moving speedily and being glorified just as it is in fact with you.” (2 Thess. 3:1) Note that he requested them to pray for him and his companions to be successful in spreading the Word of truth. Praying for others to be spiritually fruitful, strengthened, united and instructed is praying for right things. Jesus himself did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the stirring prayer Jesus gave in the presence of his apostles at the evening meal just before his death, he prayed for them and for others who were not as yet his followers. “I make request, not concerning these only, but also concerning those putting faith in me through their word; in order that they may ail be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, in order that the world may believe that you sent me forth.” (John 17: 20, 21) When we pray for persons of goodwill toward God as he did, it helps to bind us close to them in loving unity no matter where they may live on earth. This interest in others who are in the faith contributes to the peace of the worldwide Christian congregation. How much more acceptable to God are these prayers than those that petition him to bless efforts to destroy one’s fellowmen because of political wars between worldly governments!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">When praying for others it is proper to pray for their welfare, their spiritual health, their growth in Scriptural wisdom and knowledge, their spiritual strength, their Christian unity, their prosperity in serving God and for other things that contribute to a peaceful and spiritually fruitful life. It is even proper to pray for worldly rulers, that they may be discreet and just when dealing with God’s servants. Paul said: “I therefore exhort, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, offerings of thanks, be made concerning all sorts of men, concerning kings and all those who are in high station; in order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.” (1 Tim. 2:1, 2) Your prayers for the spiritual welfare of others are expressions of neighbor love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Love is the basis for effective prayers —love for God and love for neighbor. Out of love for God our prayers should center on things that pertain to him and his purposes. Out of love for neighbor our prayers should manifest concern for the spiritual welfare of others. The reason “a righteous man’s supplication, when it is at work, has much force” is that he has faith and that he prays for right things.—Jas. 5:16.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23">T</span><span class="font16">IE swift invasion of the Portuguese territories of Goa, Damao and Diu by the armed forces of India in December, 1961, brought a sudden change in the appearance of India on world maps. It threw all existing world maps out of date. This surprising annexation of these enclaves on the west coast of India served as a reminder of the many changes map makers have had to make since the turn of the century. Through wars and the rising tide of nationalism the appearance of world maps today is radically different from what it was then. To improve our awareness of the historical happenings of this turbulent century, let us see how the present world map has changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The twentieth century began with the principal powers of the world maintaining far-flung colonial empires. In Africa, Asia, the islands of the Pacific and the Americas their flags waved over their territories, and millions upon millions of people lived in subjection to their authority. In Europe the boundaries of many of the present countries took in more territory than they do today. Some countries existing today were' not existing then and some that were existing then do not exist today. This can be seen by comparing a recent world map with one that was printed before World War I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A map of 1910, for example, will show Germany stretching unbroken from France to Russia. On her southern border appeared the Hapsburg Empire of Austria-Hungary that reached from Switzerland to the border of Russia. South of Austria-</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Hungary were the tiny countries of Montenegro and Serbia, which no longer exist. Romania formed the southeastern border. To the south of Romania lay the country of Bulgaria. These small countries to the south of Austria-Hungary came out of the Turkish Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the beginning of the twentieth century Turkey still held some territory in Europe. It came to the southern borders of Montenegro, Serbia and Bulgaria, reached as far as the Adriatic Sea on the west, took in Macedonia on the south and bordered the Black Sea on the east. The main body of the Turkish Empire sprawled over the Middle East, taking in Asia Minor, stretching south to Arabia and then swinging as a wide strip down the entire length of the west coast of Arabia. On the eastern side of Arabia it reached, as a narrow strip, halfway down the coast. Today the appearance of Turkey is radically changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To the north of Turkey the vast Russian Empire came to the border of Sweden and followed the shore of the Baltic Sea to the eastern boundary of Germany. The remainder of its western border was next to</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Austria-Hungary and Romania. The countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland were nonexistent at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Their territories were part of the Russian Empire. It was war that brought a sweeping change to the world map as it appeared at the turn of the century.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Effect of World War /</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">At the conclusion of the first world war, the representatives of the principal victorious nations began carving up the vanquished. Germany lost her many colonies to various members of the Allied nations, and her home territory was cut up. A slice off the western part consisting of Alsace-Lorraine was given to France, and bits were given to Belgium and Denmark. It was on Germany’s eastern border that the largest section was carved out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A generous piece of Germany was joined with a portion of Russia to form the new state of Poland, which had not existed since it was divided up by Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary in the eighteenth century. In the process East Prussia was severed from the main body of German territory by a territorial corridor that gave Poland access to the Baltic Sea. Hie southern part of Poland was formed by a chunk of territory from what had belonged to Austria-Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Under the territorial knives of the Allies, Austria-Hungary was thoroughly carved up. Out of this former Hapsburg Empire the countries of Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were formed, and, as we have noted, a portion in the north went to Poland. In the south a large portion was joined with Montenegro, Serbia and small pieces of Bulgaria to form the new state of Yugoslavia. In the east, a big slice known as Transylvania went to Romania, which also acquired a portion of territory from Russia known as Bessarabia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Besides losing Bessarabia and the large portion that went toward the formation of Poland, Russia lost the territory that went to form the new country of Finland. Along the coast of the Baltic Sea she lost still more territory when the tiny Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania joined Finland in declaring their independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After World War I the Allies changed the map of the'Middle East by cutting up the Turkish Empire. Turkey had lost practically everything she held In Europe before the war started, and now she was due to lose the major portion of her territory in the Middle East. What was south of Asia Minor was partitioned into a number of sections. The northern part was called Syria and was made a mandated territory of France until its independence in 1944. The same was true of Lebanon, Palestine became a mandated territory of Great Britain as well as the territory east of it to the border of Persia, now called Iran. This territory and Palestine are now divided into the three independent states— Israel, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Iraq.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>After World War II</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">The second world war saw many changes in the world map. The alterations in territorial boundaries that Hitler made were only temporary, being changed when the war ended. The Soviet Union expanded its territory in Europe by annexing Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It also took northern Bukovina and Bessarabia from Romania. In addition to this it added parts of Finland, Poland and East Prussia to its territory. Besides making these additions to its territory it extended its sphere of influence over the countries of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. It was Soviet influence in East Germany that resulted in Germany’s being divided, causing maps to show a divided Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The total territory of East and West Germany is now considerably smaller than what Germany possessed following her defeat in World War I. This is due mainly to the annexing by Poland of a portion of East Prussia as well as a generous piece of eastern Germany. In the Far East the world map was experiencing </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">additional </span><span class="font16">changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Prior to the war Japan had possession of Formosa, Korea and Manchuria and was attempting to swallow China. During the war she had extended her sphere of influence over three million square miles of the Far East. This aggressive expansion brought temporary changes in the world map until Japan was stripped of her territories at the end of the war. Manchuria, which was called Manchukuo while held by the Japanese, was taken over by China after Soviet troops were withdrawn. Korea was occupied jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font16"> in </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Germany,</span><span class="font16"> this joint occupation resulted in a divided Korea with the formation of separate independent governments.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Nationalism Brings Changes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">A considerable change in world maps during this twentieth century can be attributed to the rising </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">tide of nationalism. The cry</span><span class="font16"> of subject people for independence has caused the great colonial empires that girdled the earth at the beginning of the century to crumble into a myriad inde- ■ pendent pieces held together by a loose union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At the present time world attention is focused on Africa, where the struggle for independence has resulted In frequent eruptions of bloody violence. One by one the territorial holdings of European powers have been breaking the grip of colonial rule and have been setting up independent states. How strikingly this has changed the appearance of Africa is best seen by comparing the most recent map of Africa with one published prior to World War I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On a map of 1910, for example, a great strip of territory that began with Egypt and ran south to Lake Victoria, near the center of Africa, and east to the Indian Ocean was indicated as a British possession. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Today this strip has a very different </span><span class="font16">appearance. Egypt was cut out of it when she obtained independence in 1922. What Was then called the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan gained independence in 1956 and is now called the Sudan. British East Africa appeared on a piece of territory bordering the Indian Ocean. Today, although it is still held by Great Britain, it is called Kenya. It and Uganda to the west of it are the remnants that Britain still holds of that huge strip of territory that was once hers. These also expect early independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To the south of Kenya is the newly independent, once British-administered trusteeship of Tanganyika that appeared on the map of 1910 as German East Africa. It was one of the German colonies given to Great Britain as a mandated territory following World War I. To the southwest of Tanganyika there is another British territory called Rhodesia on the old maps but now labeled, since 1953, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font16"> consists of the British protectorates of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland along with the independent territory of Southern Rhodesia. To the north of this federation lies a large section of central Africa that recently has undergone a change resulting in a painful sore </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">for the</span><span class="font16"> world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Bloody strife has torn at the vitals of the Republic of the Congo ever since it received its independence from Belgium on June 30, 1960. It is a large area, equal in size to the land area that lies east of the Mississippi in the United States. On the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">map of 1910 it was called the Kongo. Kaier </span><span class="font16">maps labeled it the Belgian Congo. To its west this old map showed a wide section of territory that ran from the Atlantic Ocean deep into the heart of Africa, swinging north into the Sahara desert and expanding north to the Mediterranean Sea and west to the Atlantic Ocean. This huge chunk of Africa was held*by the French. Today it is divided up into many independent states that are loosely united in what is called the French Community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">What was the French Kongo on a map of 1910 is now the two independent states of the Republic of Congo, a name similar to its strife-tom neighbor, and Gabon. The French and British mandated territory of Cameroun (a former German colony) on the northern border of Gabon is also an independent country now. The remainder of the once-giant French African holding is partitioned into the independent states of the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger, Mali, Upper Volta, Dahomey, Togo, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, Tunisia and Morocco. Now Algeria is on the verge of independence. Another French possession, the island of Madagascar, off the east coast of Africa, became an independent country in 1958. Since then map makers have had to change their maps for this territory from Madagascar to Malagasy Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A British territory on the west coast of Africa is shown on a map of 1910 as the Gold Coast, but this name no longer appears on up-to-date maps. Since it became self-governing in 1957 the Gold Coast has been known as Ghana. Near to Ghana is another former British possession, the Federation of Nigeria. This new state, which received its independence in 1960, consists of three distinct autonomous regions. On the opposite side of Africa an old map showed the British and Italian colonies of the British Somali Coast and Italian Somaliland. These are now joined to form the Republic of Somalia, which was born in 1960. In north Africa the former Italian possession of Tripoli was enlarged to form the constitutional monarchy of Libya. Thus the persistent forces of nationalism have been changing the face of Africa, particularly since World War II; but not only Africa. They have made changes in other parts of the world as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Under the pressure of nationalism India was granted independence in 1947, but that same pressure caused it to become divided into the separate states of India and Pakistan. Its appearance today is very different from what it was on a map of 1910. At that time India and neighboring Burma were shown as one country because both were held by Great Britain. Today they are separated, with the territory divided still more by the formation of Pakistan. A somewhat similar fate came to French Indochina. On old maps it was shown as one French possession, but now it is partitioned into four independent states— Cambodia, Laos, South Vietnam and North Vietnam. The force of nationalism has also brought a change to what were the Netherlands East Indies, a group of islands lying to the south of former French Indochina. They now form the independent state of Indonesia. Thus the pressure of nationalism has been instrumental in changing the old picture of vast colonial empires to one of numerous selfdetermining states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The recent action by India to annex Portuguese territories is only a small incident in the many map-changing happenings caused by nationalism and war. Comparing our world map today with what it was before World War I can help to increase our awareness of the significant changes in this exceptional period of human history.</span></p>

According to lifeinsurance records, for every ten lean persons who live to be eighty, only one fat person makes it. In the 20-29 age bracket, obese adult males have an 80-percent higher death rate than the nonobese males of the same age group. If you are thirty years</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">of age or older and you weigh twenty pounds above average, your likelihood of dying soon is 10 percent higher than for others your age. If you are twenty-five pounds above average, your chances of dying soon are 25 percent higher; if fifty pounds above, your odds are 50 to 75 percent higher. However, among stout people who reduce and stay that way for ten years, the death rates drop to normal. Obviously, the desire to stay alive is one good reason to watch your weight, but it is not the only reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Fat can cause other harm besides killing you outright. Not only are fat people poor surgical risks, but they are more likely to suffer from heart and kidney diseases, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, gallstones, spinal deformities, bronchitis, asthma, circulatory complications and flat feet. Obesity can also interfere with conception, cause complicated pregnancies and result in fewer healthy infants. Interestingly, Dr. Harry J. Johnson, president of the Life Extension Foundation, expressed the belief that “overweight is the outstanding health hazard today.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>A Threat to You?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">A quick survey of yourself may convey a false sense of security in this matter. Even if your present weight is “perfect,” it is wisdom on your part to keep it that way as far as possible. Doctors suspect that </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">growing</span><span class="font16"> fat may be more dangerous than </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font16"> fat. There is evidence to show that in the process of putting on excessive weight, damage is done to the blood vessels, particularly the blood vessels of your heart. If this is really so, there is ample reason for people who are prone to gain weight to watch their weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But how can you determine whether your present weight is satisfactory or not? Checking the scale and chart at the local drugstore may not be the answer. The “average” weight usually shown on such charts is not necessarily your most desirable weight. For example, it is known that many persons thirty years of age and up are, on the average, twenty pounds above their most desirable weight—the weight that would mean longest life expectancy. Yet, by ordinary standards,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">they might consider themselves of average weight. Then, too, very muscular people tend to be overweight, by usual standards, for their height. Yet their bodies may contain very little fat. The problem is not so much your body weight, but the amount of excess fat in the body. This is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You can get a general idea of your own situation by pinching the flesh below your ribs with your thumb and index finger. If your thumb and finger are mpre than an inch apart you may suspect that unnecessary fat is present. Another simple test is to lie on your back and observe if your midsection is higher than your chest. If weight reduction seems advisable in your case, it is a good idea to verify your conclusion with your physician before undertaking a weight-reduction program. If you are inclined toward heart disease, diabetes or a kidney ailment, a reducing program could cause complications.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Drugs and Fat Profits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">The growing public interest in weight control has tempted manufacturers to flood the field with a great variety of drugs and gadgets that promise wonders. Every year hundreds of millions of dollars are exchanged for pills, pads, pillows, pastes, creams, bath <sub>s</sub> salts, candy, gum, automatic rollers, couches, reducing belts, girdles, drugs that stimulate metabolism and drugs that depress the appetite. So far, medical science has not come up with a simple, safe drug, food or device that will bring about weight loss. At best, drugs are sometimes helpful as temporary aids in a weight-reducing program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many reducing agents are actually food supplements that have no effect on food intake. Purgatives and diuretics provide only temporary weight loss through dehydration. Some products base their claims on the substitution of water or air for nutrients, according to Dr. H. Amphlett Williams of London. Doctors say that some “pep pills” are actually habit-forming; others may cause vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, heartburn, depression, excitement or restlessness. Any drug that increases your body’s chemical activity may also increase your appetite. Many appetite curbers are simply powdered milk, sugars and pleasant flavoring that raise your level of blood sugar. You can get the same result for less money by eating a piece of cheese or hard candy. Of course, there are other competitors for the public’s attention, such as diet fads and formula foods. These bear watching too.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Diet Fads</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Through the years many diet fads have been tried. Recently some teen-agers have been endangering their health by the lack-of-sleep diet, the starvation diet and the cigarette-and-coffee diet. Weight-conscious youths even have revived the disgusting ancient Roman custom of forced regurgitation—a practice that may cause exhaustion, nervousness and anemia. The diet fads adopted by many adults are not satisfactory either, because the very word “diet&quot; implies a new, short-term eating program that will end. When the diet is over, the weight returns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In the last two years over a hundred liquid and ready-mix reducing aids have hit the market, along with reducing soups, candies, cookies and frozen desserts in 300-calorie portions. These formula diets unquestionably are convenient because they eliminate the bother of planning a calorie-measured meal. However, an outstanding weakness of these formula foods is their monotony. You could not expect to get the enjoyment out of a liquid meal that you would from a regular meal of equal caloric value. Staying on a monotonous diet is difficult. It is reported that some formula faddists even have believed that they could eat as much as they wanted to and still lose weight, so long as they were loyal to the formula diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Dr. Philip L. White, secretary of the American Medical Association’s Council on Foods and Nutrition, pointed out another serious objection to the formula foods. He warned: “If the user of a formula diet consumed no other fluids, dehydration of his body could result.” A big drawback to formula diets and crash diets of any kind is their failure to change the consumer’s basic eating habits on a permanent basis. As Dr. Stanley A. Tauber, of Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, pointed out: “It is unlikely that a patient who loses weight on a liquid diet will then . . . suddenly and miraculously begin to eat a normal, wholesome, well-balanced diet and maintain the weight loss.” Frequent losing and regaining of weight is not desirable either if it is true that the process of gaining excessive weight can have harmful effects on the blood vessels. It is not difficult to understand why many doctors say the only satisfactory program of weight control is one that results </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font16"> permanent weight loss and lifetime control of weight. But where can weight-watchers find such a program?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Calories or Carbohydrates?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Current medical opinion seems to offer you a choice of the low-calorie or the low-carbohydrate approach to -weight control. If one method does not help you, the other may give the desired results. It seems that for most people the problem is basically one of food supply, energy demand and self-control. (Heredity or glandular problems are factors in less than 10 percent of all cases of overweight.) </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The low-calorie </span><span class="font16">method is based on the knowledge that a pound of body fat burned as energy equals about 3,500 calories. A calorie is the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of energy produced by the food you eat. When you are past twenty-five your body does not burn up calories as rapidly as </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">it used to and, consequently, you </span><span class="font16">require less food. If you eat just a little more than your body requires—as many people do—that surplus will be stored in your body as fat. However, if you reduce your weekly food intake by 3,500 calories you may expect to lose a pound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many doctors recommend the low-calorie program. Said Dr. Herbert Pollack, of the American Diabetes Association: “The whole point ought to be to re-educate people’s eating habits—to eat two pancakes instead of six.” England's Dr. Hugh M. Sinclair, director of Oxford University’s Laboratory of Human Nutrition, likewise declared that “a sincere change in habits is needed.” Dr. Fredrick J. Stare, director of Harvard University’s Department of Nutrition, put it this way: “Probably the biggest change in our dietary habits is the development of this concept that the important thing in a diet is to cut down on the intake of all foods, with the possible </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">exception of proteins, rather than to cut </span><span class="font16">things out. . . . The main principle of good nutrition, whether we’re talking about diets for weight reduction or weight gain, is to eat a variety of foods—a variety of vegetables, a variety of fruits. Now, if you want to try to lose weight, the thing to do </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">is to eat less but still have the variety.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">While moderation is the rule in the low-calorie method, it does not mean that snacks between meals are completely out. If snacks are used in moderation to decrease the size of regular meals by making you less hungry at mealtime, then snacks </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">may not</span><span class="font16"> be </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">objectionable.</span><span class="font16"> Likewise, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">going </span><span class="font16">above the desirable intake of food on any particular day can be adjusted by eating that much less the next day. Increased walking, standing or other physical activity each day is also beneficial because it helps you bum up calories. Be careful, however, that too much activity does not stimulate your appetite!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In a number of cases where the low-calorie program has failed, the low-carbohydrate method is' said to have brought happy results. This alternate approach allows free intake of protein and fat whenever and in whatever quantity desired, but it strictly limits your intake of sugars and starches. This means you can eat a wide variety of meats, but you must avoid bread, cake, rolls, pies, crackers, doughnuts, sweets and certain fruits and vegetables with high carbohydrate content. Advocates of this program believe that some people get fat, not because of overeating, but simply because their bodies cannot handle sugars and starches. Even advocates of the low-calorie approach urge weight-watchers to “get enough fats.” Fat contains more than twice as many calories as other foods of equal weight, but it has the desirable effect of delaying hunger because the body absorbs it slowly.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Self-Examination</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">The health hazard alone is sufficient reason why you should watch your weight, but there are other very desirable motives as well. Weight-reduction can mean new energy, a more youthful appearance, smaller grocery bills, freedom from unnecessary embarrassments and a real sense of accomplishment. If you overeat because of unhappiness, boredom, nervousness, insecurity or similar reason, take steps to improve your spiritual outlook on life and the future. Then eat well, but wisely, as you watch your weight. And remember: the food that can kill your happiness—and you—is not worth eating.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">“The Handwriting Foundation in Washington,’’ reports the magazine </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Medical World News,</span><span class="font15"> “has set out to establish a program to cure medical cacography, which is reaching epidemic levels.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Mouche</span><span class="font15"> syndrome because the affected handwriting presents a striking resemblance to tracks left on paper by a fly that has dipped its legs in ink.)

<p><span class="font16">the reason. Perhaps new slip covers for the furniture are needed, or the kitchen curtains are faded and require replacing. A dozen more ideas can stimulate one to reach for the thimble and thread. But are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font16"> considering sewing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">First, consider the reasons, and there are many. Some enjoy it as a hobby; they find it relaxing and get satisfaction from doing something creative. Then there are many who sew simply to save money; and if you have growing children and an average income, you can see the practicalness of this. Also, it is a matter of necessity in those countries where ready-made clothes are not generally available. For those who are hard to fit, the answer often is for them to make their own clothes. Some who want or need to supplement the family income find it a good part-time job; they can be at home and work when they have the time convenient. Neither should it be overlooked as full-time employment. The reason for sewing affects the work involved</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By 'Awake!' correspondent in the Bahamas</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">and the results wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Sewing in this modern age clearly has advantages. Compared with grandmother’s problems of sewing, we have an easy time. With the wash-and-wear and crease-resistant fabrics and the wide range of designs to choose from, we may take some time to decide just what we want. Grandmother was more apt to get her cloth from a flour sack or from a small selection of materials at the general store. Now there are many good patterns available, and some of these are especially marked and designed for the beginner. Sewing machines are practical and within the reach of averageincome families in many countries; if not electric machines, at least hand-turning or foot-treadle ones. Often classes are available at convenient times so that you can learn under the guidance of an experienced teacher. If you want instructions, it will be no trouble to get a book or save articles of instruction found in magazines.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>A Few Tips</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">But how should you personally decide whether to sew at home? It would be wise to consider the country in which you live, from the viewpoint of what is available in the way of material and equipment. In some areas it is just as economical to buy clothing as to make it yourself, so there is no financial advantage. However, if you are choosing it for a hobby, the money spent may be justified. But it is wise to consider how involved in terms of time and money you can afford to become. Remember, just because modern, efficient, do-everything machines are available, that does not mean you cannot do good work on the older types, especially if you already have one. Make your investment fit your circumstances. If you are thinking of sewing to help the budget, then you might defeat your purpose if you spend too much for the most modem machine. However, if you plan to engage in it steadily, you may feel the investment worthwhile. How much time do you have to spend? If you have a full-time job, you may not have sufficient time. What are the results </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">you </span><span class="font16">want?—a relaxing hobby? keeping the family tidy on a limited income? employment? or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">You may benefit from a few hints if you are new at sewing. Most of these are just good sense, time-tested ideas that will make sewing more enjoyable for you. If an average woman wants the satisfaction of a well-finished garment, she will probably have to use a pattern. Of course, this is not always the case; some do well without a pattern, but they are usually those with an aptitude to foresee the finished product. You may be in tears after your first dress if you try this and do not have a knack, for it. For most, shortcuts cause disappointments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If you have done sewing before and felt the necklines and shoulders were gaping or big, it may be you should switch to a pattern a size smaller. You can more easily adjust the bust, waist and hips a little to compensate, and it is not as discouraging as trying to adjust necklines that are too large or armholes that are too deep. Sleeves and collars are especially discouraging if you try to take a shortcut from the instructions. You must baste (hand sew with long stitches to keep temporarily in place) the collar and sleeves into place before machine sewing if you want them to ease in properly. Clip the curved neckline and sleeve curving by cutting out small “v” shapes of material so that they will flatten without looking twisted. Trim the three layers of material around the neckline in graduated widths and then it won’t be bulky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is wise to buy strong, long scissors for cutting out the fabric, and you may want to use pinking or scalloping shears to keep the edges from raveling. These should be used after the seams are sewn together and before you press them open. Ironing as you go is one of the secrets of good dressmakers. Press underarm darts down and seams open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To stretch wardrobe dollars, make a simple, basic pattern and suppress the urge to dress it up too much. Then a change of scarf, belt, beads, or collar and cuffs and you have a new dress. If you do decide to add trimming, a word of caution—check the price of materials for these finishing touches before purchasing or you may spend more for trimming than for fabric for the entire garment. However, trimming wisely chosen can give you a smart garment with the flourish that just suits you. If you make fewer outfits that are better finished, then change of styles will not cause so much waste. Avoid impulse selection of fabric or style of pattern or you may have a closet full of dresses you don’t wear often because you are not really pleased with them. If you sew as a hobby and money is not of too much concern to you, then you may enjoy trying all the new styles. Otherwise, the basic proportions of keeping the waistline at the waist and following other natural body lines will keep you looking nice on a budget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Most seamstresses suggest that, to begin sewing, you pick a floral print in a cotton fabric, as that material is easier to handle for inexperienced hands, and the floral print will not expose your first minor errors for all the world to see. If your pocketbook is the reason for sewing, don’t be afraid to attempt altering a wrong size or style that has been given to you. A little ingenuity and courage and you will have a dress that looks as though it were made just for you. In lowering hems for children or letting out seams, you can add a little inexpensive trim to cover a faded line; put some to match on the collar, yoke or sleeves and a child will get joy out of the added wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many women dislike making something over, and would rather sew a garment from the beginning. I suppose we all prefer that, but if it is either do over a hand-me-down garment or have none at all, you will soon develop a special satisfaction in meeting the challenge.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Experienced Hands</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Here in the Bahamas, as in countless other places, many women have set up small places of business, some even in a corner of their own house. In many cases, these women </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">work without the help of </span><span class="font16">electric machines, yes, even without a pattern. The customer may simply describe the style of dress she wants or point out a pretty design in a magazine. After taking the needed measurements, the seamstress is ready </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">to cut and stitch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The result is far from plain, often including insets of lace or other fancy trim. The loyalty of customers to their seamstresses testifies to the fact that the work is good and the service prompt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Of course, you cannot expect to sew like that when you first begin. Skill comes with experience. The first question is, Do you want to sew?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Your husband might really appreciate your making clothes for the children, and in this way helping with expenses, but the advantages in this regard depend much on where you live. On the other hand, you may be looking for a job that allows you to make your own schedule so you will have time free for other interests. Sewing may be the answer. Or you may simply find that it is a constructive, satisfying hobby, but be careful that it does not encroach on time that you need for more important things.</span></p>

He sped out to the airport and was delighted to secure a seat on a jet bound for San Francisco that had a stopover in Chicago. He was almost there, and congratulating himself that the jet had saved him almost an hour in time, when word came back from the pilot that, due to fog conditions in Chicago, the plane was proceeding directly to San Francisco. Shortly afterward (these jets are swift), he found himself at the airport in San Francisco. After making a series of loud, intemperate remarks . . . , he struck up an acquaintance with a number of airline executives, who were </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">distressed—nay, distrait—to </span><span class="font15">discover his predicament, . . . Red tape disappeared as though by magic, as the management went into action. Within an hour, they had bundled him onto the last precious seat of a jet bound for New York with a stopover in Chicago.

<p><span class="font15">While visiting a business school in Texas, a Witness observed an </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font15"> magazine lying on the desk in the main office.

A teacher had obtained the magazine and had discovered the article &quot;Mathematical Short Cuts.” She took it to the school officials, who were delighted with this unique method. The school official went on to explain how they were going to teach the students this method.

<p><span class="font23">A</span><span class="font16">UTO care, like gray hair and taxes, is something most people prefer not to think about until they really have to. According to one report, only 25 percent of the car owners in America take reasonably good care of their cars, 25 percent do not have the money or the inclination, and the remaining 50 percent have the money, could if they wanted to, but they simply do not care. Most of these are of the opinion that car care does not pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Well, does it or doesn’t it pay to carp for your car? It most certainly does pay— primarily in two ways: in cold cash and in operating efficiency. For example, a five-year-old used car that has been well cared for will bring as much as $300 more from a buyer. As for operating efficiency, most of the car troubles that leave tens of thousands of car owners stranded along the road in all parts of the world could easily be avoided if these people cared a little more for their cars; because most of these troubles are caused by little things, such as an empty gas tank, a broken fan belt, tire troubles or an overheated engine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">pensive and easier to service. Cars loaded down with automatic equipment may be nice to own, but those extras can in time run up huge repair bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If you plan to keep a new car more than a year, it will pay you to get acquainted with the engine and to learn how to make minor adjustments. Washing, greasing, changing oil, servicing the filters and caring for the fan belt are items that a person without any previous mechanical knowledge can learn to do. For example, the fan-belt tension needs checking every 5,000 miles, for in that time it will have traveled over 60,000,000 miles, and it may be slipping a little. As a precautionary measure, it may be wise to carry a spare fan belt in the trunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Also, learn to keep the engine clean. A heavy layer of oil dirt acts like a blanket. It may be responsible for boil-overs and vapor locks. Auto-supply stores have degreasing solutions. Simply brush on to emulsify the mess, then flush off with hot water. It is as easy as that to keep your engine clean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">If the engine overheats, the thing to do is slip the car into neutral and race the motor a bit when you stop for a light. That will cool it. If it vapor-locks, simply lift the hood and pour cold water on the fuel line, the fuel pump and the carburetor. It will start the next time you turn the switch. To prevent vapor-locking, wrap the fuel line nearest the exhaust manifold with glass fiber or asbestos tape. You will save yourself money, delay and embarrassment if you always follow closely the directions in the car owner’s “Operating Manual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Bear in mind that an automobile is not a plaything. It is a powerhouse on wheels and it needs care. The average car, for example, has more than 30,000 parts. More than 680 operations are performed before a low-priced-car carburetor is assembled. Traveling 3,000 miles, a car will waste enough heat to warm a seven-room house for months, generate enough electricity to keep a television set going for weeks and pump enough water to bathe a large family daily for a half year. It takes care to keep such equipment in good order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But how much service work can one do on his own car? Very little without special tools and mechanical know-how. Nearly every unit seems hard to get at anymore and repairs appear to require more and more precise workmanship, for on any car today there are a number of adjustments that must be measured by the repairman to the thousandth of an inch. Nevertheless, there are dozens of things a car owner can do to prolong the life, beauty and operational efficiency of his car. What are some of these?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Driving, Gas and OU</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">About the first thing a car owner should do is learn to drive properly. This is a great money saver in itself. Fast starting and quick stopping not only waste gas but also cause greater wear on the engine, tires and brakes. When starting out with a cold engine a great deal of wear can be avoided by driving slowly until the engine is warm. Do not race the engine when parked, hoping to heat it up in a hurry in that way. That will only ruin the engine and waste gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Stick to regular gas unless your owner’s manual tells you to use premium high-octane fuel. High-octane gas will add little if any more mileage. If your car knocks or pings a little as a result of using regular gas, get a mechanic to make a simple ignition adjustment that will allow your engine to operate smoothly on regular fuel. Almost any engine can be adjusted to go just fine on regular. There may be a slight loss of power, but not enough to matter. Think of the savings on every gallon you buy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Save by not throwing your money away on gas additives. They may dirty up your engine. And, too, keep the gas tank always more than half full, because running low increases the chance of dirt, water or sediment to be drawn through the fuel system to the carburetor, where it can cause no end of trouble. And remember that your car engine is a real gas hog at high speeds or when the car is idling. So slow down to save and, when parked, turn the ignition switch off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Many car owners ask, “How often must the oil be changed?” If you ask a service station attendant that question, he probably will say, “Every 500 to 1,000 miles,” because it is his business to sell oil. If your car is an oil burner, then add a quart every 500 miles or so and that is all the change it needs. If it does not burn oil, then a change every 3- to 4,000 miles will do. When taking a straight long trip, you may be able to go 5- to 6,000 miles before changing oil. However, check your car owner’s manual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">High speed is the greatest single cause for high oil consumption. So to save, slow down. You can save, too, by buying your oil wholesale and in large quantities, such as in 5-gaIlon cans or by the case. Some companies wholesale oil and many large department stores offer good buys on bulk oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The time for greasing your car varies with the conditions and the miles driven. Every 3- to 5,000 miles or six to eight weeks the car should be greased. Some new-model cars, manufacturers say, can go 30,000 miles.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Tire Care</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">The Rubber Manufacturers Association’s researchers said that a careful car driver can double the life of his tires by slowing down and by being just a little more careful. Speed increases tire wear tremendously. Tires bum up twice as fast at 60 miles an hour as they do at 30 miles an hour. According to a study by the B. F. Goodrich Company, a tire that would give 15,000 miles of service on a car driven at an average speed of 30 miles an hour will last less than 9,000 miles at 50 miles an hour. Cut your speed to save rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The effect of hot weather on tire wear is also startling. For example, at 80° F. a tire will wear out more than three times as fast as at 40° F. If possible, drive when it is cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another thing, check tire pressure at least once a week and always when tires are cold. Under-inflated tires cost more in wear and gas consumption; over-inflation increases center wear and multiplies the danger of impact breaks. But two to four pounds over-inflation is better than any under-inflation. Additional air pressure reduces drag, increases gas mileage and improves car handling too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A question often asked is, “How often should tires be rotated?” Rotate all tires, including the spare, at least once every 5,000 miles. Any regular rotation pattern will do. Always keep your best tires on the front wheels. Blowout of rear tires is less hazardous than one on a front tire. It is best to buy new tires in the fall, because winter driving is less hazardous if the tread on all tires is in good condition. And it may be wise to paint your name, address and telephone number on the inside of the hub caps. You never can tell, it may be returned to you if you happen to lose one.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Tune-ups and Mufflers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Auto mechanics generally agree that your car should be tuned up every 5,000 miles. However, there are small-car manufacturers that say their vehicles can go 10,000 miles without a tune-up. And, too, managers who own large fleets of cars emphasize that tune-ups are not preventive but corrective maintenance. They recommend not having a tune-up until the car is hard to start, stalls frequently, or burns too much gas. If it does not have these ailments, they say, your car does not need a tune-up. Even when your car acts up, they recommend that you tell the mechanic precisely what is wrong, rather than order a tune-up. Why pay for a whole package deal, say garagemen, when only one or two services are all that may be required?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">During the first few minutes after you start the engine of your car, rust-causing moisture condenses on the inside of the cold muffler and tail pipe. A ten-mile trip will heat these parts and dry up the moisture, but a short trip will allow the moisture to stay and rust the exhaust pipe. As for short trips, a report prepared for the Society of Automotive Engineers by a General Motors Research Laboratories team pointed out that 50 percent of all motor trips today are of four miles or fewer—the type of driving that is hardest on your car. Therefore, have your muffler and tail pipe inspected every time you have your car lubricated. Although aluminum, stainless steel and ceramic-coated mufflers and tail pipes cost more, they offer complete protection against rusting.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Battery and Generator</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Another part of the car that needs attention is the battery. It is the heart of the automobile’s electrical system. It furnishes the power necessary to start the engine and to operate all the electrical equipment when the car is stopped. But it takes approximately ten miles of driving just to put back the charge used in starting the engine. When the trips are shorter than ten miles, the battery never gets fully restored. Thus it becomes weaker and weaker. Therefore, have the battery checked (not just watered) every month, especially if you do a lot of city driving. Have the battery cables and terminals cleaned every 10,000 miles or about once a year. Tighten the clamps well. Cover the posts and clamps with vaseline or heavy grease to prevent corrosion. In freezing weather, after adding distilled or mineral-free water to the battery, drive your car around for about fifteen minutes. This will allow the water to mix thoroughly with the fluid in the battery and prevent freezing and damage. Another wise thing for many is to give the battery a slow charge once a month. The cost is small, but it assures a quick start no matter how cold the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Generators so often go neglected. They work faithfully until a brush wears out or a short circuit develops. A few drops of oil in the little capped receptacle or a dab of grease on the pad that greases the shaft will lengthen the life of the generator. A casual look at its brushes every 5,000 miles may prevent ruining an armature. To replace the brushes and to wipe off the contact area of the armature with a gasoline-soaked cloth requires no great skill, but it does wonders for the generator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Spark plugs should be cleaned and gapped every 3,000 miles; some new-car manuals say every 10,000 miles. And when you buy plugs be sure the ones you get are new and not rebuilt spark plugs.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>What and How to Wash</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">If you own a convertible, it will pay to take care of the top. Do not lower a damp top into the storage compartment. Keep it raised and in place until it is fully dry. At least once every two months the top should be washed. Before washing, remove all loose dirt from the fabric with a whisk broom or a vacuum cleaner. Then wash with cold water and a mild liquid soap. Rinse the top well with clean water. After the top is dry, then brush it lightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Windshields need attention too. They cost over $100, so take care that you drive a safe distance behind cars when on a dirt road. Never clean your windshield with a dry rag or remove ice with a metal scraper, Glass scratches easily. Clean all glass with warm or cold water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Likewise, do not try to scrape mud or dirt off the body of your car or you will scratch the finish. Use clear, cold water for the job. Never use a detergent unless the car is very dirty; even then, be sure to rinse immediately after you apply it. Some chemical cleaners have been found to be detrimental to car finishes. So be careful. Make sure the cleaner you buy can be used on your car. How often you wax or polish is, of course, up to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As for, the interior of the car, it can be cleaned with a vacuum cleaner, a whisk broom and a damp cloth. Vinyl-plastic surfaces can be wiped clean very easily. Do not be afraid to use warm water and a mild soap. A clean car is a recommendation for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Remember, nothing lessens the expense of auto maintenance as much as care itself. Auto care means money saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGIOUS RITES</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• Regarding patriotic ceremonies in Belgium, the New York </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font15">of May 12, 1959, stated: “The king is like the nation’s flag, and ceremonies connected with him are something like religious rites.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">the wharf at Honiara, Guadalcanal, because we were about to board a small ship to attend the first circuit assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses ever held in the Solomon Islands!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Cars and utilities arrived with passengers and an assortment of bags, suitcases and bedrolls. Many willing hands soon stowed the heavier baggage into the hold, while bedrolls were laid on the forward deck in preparation for the journey. It was only a few days earlier that we had at last been able to secure passage, but we were glad to have a way. A convention spirit prevailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Just before midnight the engines started up, ropes were cast off and we moved out to sea. Soon the lights of Honiara dropped astern and for a while we stayed awake to enjoy the beauty of the scene—a calm, shimmering ocean and in the background the rugged mountains of Guadalcanal rising seven and eight thousand feet. Then, fully dressed, we settled down on our mats to try to get a little sleep.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>A Warm Welcome</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Many were up at dawn to see the coastline of Malaita in the distance. The sky was overcast and the water calm as we moved up along the coast toward Auki, Flying fish rose from the water and skimmed along in front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As we drew in beside the jetty and some of the native brothers recognized us their bags, baskets, umbrellas—everything!—as all were anxious to carry some article, no matter what size it was. Guided by our Solomon Island brothers and people of goodwill, we set out to walk the two miles along a rough road and through a small river to Magi village, where we were to stay for the weekend. What love and thoughtfulness were exhibited by our hosts!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One family moved out of their house to make it available for the European brothers and sisters. This was sufficient to accommodate most of the group. Two other couples stayed with a native brother and his wife, sharing their home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The houses were simple—built up on posts and constructed of round poles covered with palm leaves. And as for bathing facilities, these were in a small stream nearby, where water cascaded over the rocks and a bamboo trough to form a delightful shower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Almost all the inhabitants of Magi are Jehovah’s witnesses and persons of goodwill.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Our Assembly</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">On Friday evening we walked to the assembly site for the opening session of the circuit assembly. We soon learned that it is not easy to walk along these ridges with the slippery, rain-soaked mud underfoot. However, always close by was someone eager to offer a hand over a difficult spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The meeting was attended by two hundred and ninety-one. Some of us had come from Honiara on Guadalcanal. Others had walked across the island, which means two days’ trudging up and down steep and slippery paths. But all were glad to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">After the program a long procession with torches and lanterns set out along the track leading to Magi, and all the way happy voices could be heard expressing their appreciation for the Bible counsel they had received that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Rising early the next morning, we set off through the village to the assembly site. As we passed by the other leaf houses cheery greetings were called out and some would hurry out to join us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It was interesting to listen as the district servant told us that morning of the expansion of the preaching work in the Solomons, from the arrival of the first of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1955 to the present four congregations totaling one hundred and eighty-six publishers along with hundreds of interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At midday we lined up at the cafeteria for our meal. Brothers moved along the line presenting each person with a large green leaf, and then as we filed past the cooking pots the food was ladled into the carefully folded leaves. Off in a shady spot we enjoyed the meal—using our fingers, in most cases. There was also water to drink—from a bamboo section fitted with an ingenious leaf spout. What a sensible arrangement! No piles of dirty dishes to wash. No tables to be erected and cleaned. All that remained was to put the leaves in a pile and dispose of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">In the afternoon we heard the discourse “Dedication and Baptism.” At the conclusion, fifteen candidates rose to their feet and, after the meeting was dismissed, we all moved down the track to the nearby Kwaipala River for the baptism. One by one the candidates, including a European youth, moved out into the water to be baptized by one of the mature Solomon Islanders. What a demonstration of the love and unity that exist among the people who worship Jehovah, irrespective of race or skin color!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Back at the leaf shelter we listened to further upbuilding counsel. This was followed by a quick meal, and then all walked into Auki to the local theater to view the picture “The New World Society in Action.” To our great joy, a total of three hundred and ninety-four persons, the peak for the assembly, viewed the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">On Sunday we took our seats under the leaf shelter to hear more beneficial talks, including the district servant’s talk, “Uniting Men in a Split-up World.” The points were driven home with the aid of an illustrated chart and two coconuts, one whole and one broken, to demonstrate the difference between being “united” and being “split up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How pleasant it was to sit under the shade, surrounded by both native and European brothers and sisters, listening to and seeing evidence that there is a united people in this split-up world! On one side of the assembly site was the village of Kwainaketto and on the other side were trees and climbing plants in profusion. Occasionally large butterflies could be seen flitting about, rivaling the birds in their beauty. As one brother remarked, “How safe it feels on this onetime cannibal island!”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">The film “Divine Will International Assembly” was to be shown in Auki that night, but as we gathered up our Bibles and bags to go the rain began to fall. Not a blustery, driving rain, but torrents of it falling straight down. We ' decided to wait for a while. Darkness fell and still the rain continued. Someone suggested a song, which was readily agreed to, and there we were singing in the dark, rain drumming on the leaf roof overhead, water running through on the ground; but all were quite happy. That night many viewed the film and tramped home afterward, still in their wet clothes, but happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The assembly over, those of us from Honiara had to start thinking about getting home again. Some of the brothers walked into Auki to make inquiries. Sure enough, transport was available. A small vessel, the “Mary,” was to sail at 3 a.m. Tuesday. That made it possible for us to attend the dedication program in the Magi Kingdom Hall on Monday night, and for that we were glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">We heard experiences from brothers regarding the problems met in earlier stages of the preaching work in these islands. One aged brother, leaning on his staff, expressed his thankfulness to Jehovah both for his loving-kindness in providing the assembly and for the brothers who had come in from other lands to serve with them. It all helped us to realize just how much the assembly and the dedication of the Kingdom Hall must mean to them, and it made us very happy to be serving along with them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Reluctant Parting</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">Later that night a long line of figures could be seen moving into Auki by the light of torches and lanterns. Down to the small ship with our baggage we went to spread out blankets on the deck in readiness for the departure at 3 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">About midnight our brothers and sisters of Malaita, with their goodwill companions, very reluctantly shook our hands and slowly departed for their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Our journey home was through the beautiful Utaha or Mboli Passage, as it is known locally. It provides magnificent scenery. After spending several hours in Tulagi, the prewar capital, while our ship underwent some repairs, we again set off, this time across Iron Bottom Sound, the graveyard of many ships and men of the navies that struggled for supremacy in World War II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As we headed for Honiara we felt that we had indeed enjoyed a wonderful privilege to be able to attend this unique assembly and taste of the great love shown by Jehovah and by the humble people who serve him. What a glorious prospect to look forward to the time when all those living will be united by that bond of love for Jehovah and for their fellowman!</span></p><img src="g_E_19611108_files/g_E_19611108-21.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:118pt;">
<p><span class="font23">F</span><span class="font16">OR ever so long there has been much confusion in Christendom on the subject of hell. There was a time when most of its clergy preached that a fiery, eternal hell awaited sinners at death. Today the trend is to speak little about hell and to picture it as a condition of conscious separation from God rather than a place of fiery torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, when we consider what the Scriptures have to say about the words usually translated hell, in particular the Hebrew word </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font16"> and the Greek word </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Hades,</span><span class="font16"> we find no basis for either idea. Giving us a clue as to the meaning is the fact that in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized</span><span class="font16"> or </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font16"> the Hebrew word </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font16"> is translated “grave” as often as it is translated &quot;hell.” It appears that there is no English word that gives the precise meaning of Sheol (Hades), for which reason modern translators have seen fit to transliterate the word into English rather than try to translate it. See </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">An American Translation, </span><span class="font16">the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font16"> and the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Standard Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">According to Strong’s </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Hebrew Lexicon, Sheol</span><span class="font16"> comes from a root meaning “to inquire, request or demand” and it is the “Hades or the world of the dead (as if a subterranean retreat) including its accessories and inmates.” And concerning it the Hebrew authority Gesenius states: “I think I have lighted on the true etymology of the word. For I have no doubt that is for a hollow, a hollow and subterranean place, just as the German </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">HoUe</span><span class="font16"> is of the same origin as </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Hohle,. , </span><span class="font16">. hohl, hollow. It is commonly derived from the idea of asking for, from its asking for, demanding all, without distinction”—in other words, the common grave of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">And what is the condition of those in Sheol (Hades) ? Ecclesiastes 9:10 answers: “All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.” Wherever in the Scriptures consciousness is associated with Sheol (Hades) we may be certain that either highly symbolical or figurative speech is being used or a parable is involved, as at Isaiah 14:9-11; Ezekiel 32:21 and Luke 16:19-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Note that Sheol (Hades) is the common grave of mankind, that is, all the graves put together, as it were, not a certain grave or a specific one. In Hebrew the words for a grave and a burial place are </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">qebUrdh</span><span class="font16"> and </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">qeber,</span><span class="font16"> both coming from a root meaning “to inter.” When Sarah died Abraham sought a “burial place” </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">(qeber) </span><span class="font16">for her body from the sons of Heth. And after Jacob had interred his beloved wife Rachel he “stationed a pillar over her grave </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">[qeburah].”</span><span class="font16"> It would not be possible to put a pillar on top of Sheol (Hades), for it has no specific location except the entire earth itself.—Gen. 23:4; 35:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The fact that Sheol (Hades) is a general place rather than a specific location, however, does not mean that it refers to a condition rather than a place. It is a place. That is why chapter 8 of the book </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font16"> is entitled “Hell, a Place of Rest in Hope.” But death is a state or condition, even as life is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since Sheol (Hades) represents a place rather than the death condition, it would not be proper to say that when Jesus died he was at once in Sheol (Hades). It was not until he made “his burial place even with the wicked” that he entered Sheol (Hades). From this place he was resurrected on the third day. So it cannot be said that a person is in hell (Sheol, Hades) from the moment of death, unless he is buried alive in the earth and then dies. —Isa. 53:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Because Sheol (Hades) represents a place, a low place, it is contrasted with another place, heaven, a high place: “If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; and if I should spread out my couch in Sheol, look! you would be there.” “And you, Capernaum, will you perhaps be exalted to heaven? Down to Hades you will come.&quot;—Ps. 139:8; Matt. 11:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then how are we to understand Revelation 20:13, which distinguishes between the sea and Hades? It says: “The sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up those dead in them.” This shows that, strictly speaking, Sheol (Hades) refers to the common </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">earthen</span><span class="font16"> grave of mankind. Bearing this out are the words of Moses regarding the rebels under the leadership of Korah: “The ground has to open its mouth and swallow up them and everything that belongs to them and they have to go down alive </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">into Sheol.”—</span><span class="font16">Num. 16:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">At Revelation 20:13 this common earthen grave is made to parallel the sea, which at times serves as a watery grave for some, for the purpose of stressing inclusiveness of all the dead. And what about “death” in this verse? Can that also be viewed as parallel rather than duplicating? Yes, in that death is said to have hold of all those in a dying condition. Those dead in Hades and in the sea are those actually dead, while those alive on earth but in the power of death are said to be in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">This parallel construction of the sea and Sheol (Hades) is also found at Amos 9: 2, 3. There Jehovah is quoted as saying that, not only if his enemies “dig down into Sheol” or if they “go up to the heavens,” will he apprehend them, but also if they should conceal themselves “on the floor of the sea, down there I shall command the serpent, and it must bite them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But what about Jonah’s words? Do they not contradict the foregoing? No, they do not. How so? In that Jonah was not in a watery grave, he was not in the midst of the sea itself but inside the huge fish; so he could say: “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help.”—Jonah 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">However, generally Sheol (Hades) is made to represent the place of all the dead, since in the land of Palestine, where most of the Bible was written, the earth was the common resting-place of the dead. This would be true even though their bodies were consumed by flames or wild beasts. —Gen. 37:33-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It might be said that there is a slight difference between Sheol and Hades, because in the Hebrew Scriptures Sheol at times is depicted as the destiny of the wicked, whereas in the Christian Greek Scriptures, Gehenna rather than Hades is shown to be their destiny. Thus Psalm 9: 17 reads: “Wicked people will turn back to Sheol, even all the nations forgetting God.” And Matthew 23:33 reads: “Serpents, offspring of vipers, how are you to flee from the judgment of [not Hades, but) Gehenna?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Therefore, we see from the Scriptures that hell, Sheol (Hades), is a place, the common grave of mankind in which the dead are unconscious; that the Scriptures distinguish between individual graves and this common grave as well as between it and the death condition. And we see that Sheol (Hades) and the sea can be given parallel construction and that at times Sheol is a more inclusive term than Hades, since it includes the destiny of the incorrigibly wicked.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Moon-Hit</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; On April 23 the United States launched the Ranger IV spacecraft, and sixty-four hours later, after a 231,486-mile journey, the 730-pound craft crashed into the far side of the moon. Even though most of the major scientific experiments involved were unsuccessful, scientists were jubilant, since it was the first U.S. moonhit, after nine previous failures. The Soviet Union made the first moon-landing on September 14, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S. Resumes Testing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">On April 24 President Kennedy gave the word to resume nuclear testing in the atmosphere, and the following day the first in a series of explosions was set off near Christmas Island in the Pacific. It was described as in ‘'the intermediate-yield range,” or somewhat less than a megaton (a mil]ion tons of TNT) of explosive power. Protests were registered the world around, but the United States defended her position by contending that Russia’s testing of last fall forced the new series of tests in order to keep up in the arms race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Armaments Threat</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In a speech at Harvard University, Nobel Prizewinning scientist Szent-Gyorgyi asserted that, as nuclear bombs become cheaper and cheaper to make, everybody will have them. He warned that &quot;the statistical chances that somewhere someone will fire one, or one will go off by mistake, are gradually increasing to certainty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Cholera Epidemic</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;$&gt; A</span><span class="font15"> cholera epidemic has spread from Indonesia, where the disease has long been confined, and is now raging in China, the Philippines, Sarawak, Borneo and Pakistan. The Philippines has been the hardest hit, with 15,000 cases and 2,000 deaths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Churches’ Position on War</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; In a speech in New York city recently Martin Nie-moeller, German church leader, said that in Germany today there are “thousands of church member atheists,&quot; and that there are fewer attending church now than in the days of Hitler. He criticized the churches for always making a distinction between “the just and the unjust war,&quot; for he asserted that “the church has never known an unjust war but has always justified the war of her own sovereign and state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Light Beam Cuts Diamond*</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">® On April 17 the General Electric Company announced that a new light-beam device called a laser had been developed to the point where it could cut diamonds, one of the toughest substances known. The instrument produces a very narrow, powerful beam by sharpening relatively weak light waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase In Philanthropy</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">•$&gt; During 1961 Americans gave an estimated $8,700,000,000 toward philanthropic causes, an increase of $500,000,000 over I960, Some $7,000,000,000 was contributed by individuals and the remaining amount came from foundations, business corporations and charitable bequests from deceased persons. An estimated 51 percent of the money went to religious institutions. N. R. Caine, certified public accountant, in an article “Rich Taxpayer Saves by Giving It Away” gives an insight as to what prompts much of today's giving. He wrote: “Every taxpayer of means who seeks the maximum tax economies in his property distribution arrangements should understand the savings which planned gifts will make available to himself, his family, and his estate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Crime Ring Kidnaps Boys</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Recently East Pakistan authorities uncovered a crime ring of 400 members who had been kidnapping young boys from </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">kvct,</span><span class="font15"> to twelve of age and training them as pickpockets, thieves and beggars. After their training the young apprentice criminals were sold to crime organizers for prices ranging from $40 to $200. The arms and legs of some of the boys were broken in order to increase their value as beggars. Officials are reported to have recovered sixty-four boys and restored them to their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Traffic Accidents</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">According to a report by The Travelers Insurance Companies the total casualties from motor vehicle accidents in the United States decreased slightly in 1961 for the first time in seven years. Deaths and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">injuries both</span><span class="font15"> dropped about one percent, to 37,600 and 3,057,000 respectively. &quot;We realize a one percent drop may seem like a small figure to many people,&quot; The Travelers spokesman said, &quot;but it represents 400 persons alive today who would have died and 21,000 less injuries than would have been the case had last year’s ratio held even.” Excessive speed is still the main killer, accounting for 33.3 percent of the deaths, the report revealed. European countries are plagued by the same problem, as indicated by the fact that more than 14,000 persons died in traffic accidents on West German roads, while nearly 500,000 suffered injuries In 1960.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Cost for Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; On April 13 the U.S. House Appropriations Committee approved a bill that will provide $47,839,491,000 to meet military expenses for the fiscal year beginning July 1. That is the equivalent of $258 for every man, woman and child in the United States, setting a peacetime record. The bill includes $16,500,000,000 for all types of weapons, $12,900,000,000 to pay military personnel, $11,500,000,000 for operations and maintenance and $6,900,000,000 for research and development. It does not include the costs for military base construction, civil defense and foreign aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Safety first</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"># An Associated Press dispatch from London reports that when production fell off at the Deri engineering works because the men were distracted every time a pretty girl swished by the window, the management solved the problem by whitewashing the window. The workers, however, objected and walked off the job in protest. But, reports factory works manager Geoffrey Batchelor: &quot;When it was </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font15">plained to the men that this had been done for their own safety they agreed to resume work. We felt it dangerous, as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font15">are operating highspeed machinery and could easily lose a finger or </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font15">hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Reading Urged</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Roman Catholic priest Francia </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">X Duffy,</span><span class="font15"> of </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">St. Patrick’s </span><span class="font15">Cathedral in New York city, sharply criticized Catholics who fail to read the Bible regularly. He told the congregation that &quot;to be ignorant of the Scriptures is not to know Christ,” and that &quot;this lack of knowledge of Christ has brought individuals and nations to the brink of disaster frequently.” He said that “we ought to compose ourselves and sit down again daily to hear the Sermon on the Mount; to digest the parables on the Kingdom; to analyze the response of our Lord to Pilate on authority and truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Helicopter Speed Record</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One day during the middle of April a United States Army pilot flew an Iroquois helicopter 133.9 miles per hour over a closed course at Fort Worth, Texas, to set a new record. </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font15">broke the previous record of 88 miles per hour, set by a pussian iq </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">1900; ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Cost for Hearing Aids'</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; A </span><span class="font15">A Senate Antitrust Subcommittee has revealed that mark ups, by dealers on hearing aids manufactured by eleven leading companies may range from 100 to over 300 percent. One type of hearing aid was cited as an example: the average manufacturing cost was $46.57, the average price the dealer paid was $93.75 and the suggested retail price jumped to $275. Such information will be of particular interest to the 1,500,000 Americans who wear hearing aids and the six to eighteen million who are hard of hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Sonic-Boom Damage</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">On April 2 when a jet fighter plane blasted through the sound barrier the resulting crash resounded through the French countryside in the heart of the Burgundy wine region. Another crash quickly followed in the cellar of a local wine dealer </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">when his</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> j-acks </span><span class="font15">collapsed and 4,000 bottles of select wines tumbled to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The U.S. Air Force reports that from 1956 through 1961 there were 3,389 complaints of sonic-boom damage in the United States and that 1,539 of the claims were approved. Damages claimed amounted to $1,500,000, and $159,000 was paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">What Goes Into Missiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The U.S. News </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;S&gt; World Report,</span><span class="font15"> in an article on United States missile power, reports that in an underground complex of three silos—containing three Titan missiles—there is enough concrete to build a sidewalk 150 miles long; enough steel to build 9,700 average-size automobiles; electric cable enough to string a lamp wire around the world; electrical wiring to equip 1,600 six-room houses; enough electronic parts to make 66,000 portable radios; air conditioning for 250 homes and enough diesel fuel to run 23 freight trains, round trip, from New York to Denver. The construction cost for such a three-missile complex is about $60,000,000. According to the report, 62 Atlas and Titan missiles are in place and are ready for virtually instant firing. Many more are in the course of construction, with the prospects of having hundreds of similar weapons ready for firing in the not too distant future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Bodies to Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">•$&gt; Scotland’s Ministry of Health reports that more people are leaving their bodies to science. in 1948-49 only two bequests were made, and in 1954-55 only tour, but in 1960-61 there were fifty-four Scottish bequests, A similar increase was reported for England and Wales. In 1936-37 there were only twenty bequests, but in 1960-61 some 442 of the English left their bodies for scientific use. The bodies are used in medical schools for research.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Cost of Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">On March 27 George McClelland, deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, told the Port Col-borne Chamber of Commerce that crime is costing Canada $200,000,000 a year. He added that there was another price for crime &quot;which cannot be valued in dollars and cents— the price we and our children pay in cynicism, lack of respect for law and order, and lack of belief in right for right’s sake.” He said that &quot;thousands and thousands of dollars” are paid to officials for favors granted, and that &quot;these kickbacks come out of the taxpayer’s pocket.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Safe Landing</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;*&gt; On the night of April 23 as a party was breaking up in Burk’s Falls, Ontario, the guests heard a plane above. “It was raining like mad and it didn’t take us long to realize that if it was a plane, the pilot was in trouble,&quot; reported Glen May. May signaled the pilot with a flashlight and the pilot signaled back. He then jumped into his car and sped at ninety miles an hour toward an emergency landing strip at nearby Ems dale, blinking his headlights on the way to direct the pilot. A safe landing was made at the airstrip by the light from the automobile headlights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Man Strangles Wildcat</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;*&gt; The Belgrade, Yugoslavia, newspaper </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Politka</span><span class="font15"> reported that when a twenty-two-pound wildcat recently attacked a peasant in a forest near Dobru-jevac in eastern Serbia, he strangled the cat with his bare hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Narcotics Deaths</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; On April 14 New York city mayor Wagnpr blamed the increase in narcotics deaths to the fact that &quot;hoodlums involved in the narcotics traffic” may be diluting heroin with poison. The dilutants, he explained, &quot;are used not only to ‘cut’ the drug, but to give it a bitter taste, a characteristic of heroin.” Narcotics deaths have increased in New York city each year, from 99 in 1957 up to 311 in 1961.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Responsibilities Neglected</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; On April 1 A. Gordon Baker, the editor of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Churchman,</span><span class="font15"> official organ of the Anglican Church of Canada, charged that churches have been sidestepping their responsibilities for centuries. He accused them of “too often drinking tea in the governor’s mansion,” instead of caring for their obligations. &quot;Christianity has become as vacuum-packed as the coffee on the shelves of today’s supermarkets,” he asserted. &quot;Surely Jesus Christ did not endow a church with His presence in order to establish a comfortable and secure private club.”</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>
