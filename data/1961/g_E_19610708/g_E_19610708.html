<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">GIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">that, through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font14">HE natural tendency is to think in terms of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">needing</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;"> </span><span class="font14">encoura g em e n t. It is better to think in terms of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">giving</span><span class="font14"> encouragement. This is the happier way. “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,” declared the Lord Jesus Christ. (Acts 20:35) Do you enjoy the happiness of giving encouragement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But is the giving of encouragement for all persons? Is it not the main obligation of the employer, the teacher and the person in position of oversight? The fact is: Everyone has the obligation to give encouragement, and certainly all Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah God sets the example in encouragement. He encourages all his servants to faithfulness. He gives encouragement by his Holy Word, the Bible. In this Book are numerous examples of faithful men, and their fine examples inspire the Christian to similar faithfulness. Realizing the need for encouragement, the Most High God once told the overseer Moses: “Commission Joshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because he is the one to pass over before this people.”—Deut. 3:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah caused the various Bible writers to give encouragement. Wrote Peter, for instance: </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font14"> am writing you in few words, to give encouragement.” (1 Pet. 5: 12) The writer of the book of Hebrews states: “God . . . stepped in with an oath, in order</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">may have</span><span class="font14"> strong encnnraga. </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">ment to lay hold on the hope</span><span class="font14"> set before us  ” (Heb. 6:17, 18) So Jehovah is the Great Encourager.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ, was always encouraging. Concerning Paul and Barnabas, the disciple Luke wrote: “They returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to remain in the faith.”—Acts 14:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The giving of encouragement is appreciated. How the early Christians appreciated the encouraging letter sent to the Christian congregations by the governing body! “After reading it,” says the Bible account, “they rejoiced over the encouragement.” —Acts 15:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When we encourage someone we give him courage, increase his hope and confidence or urge him on in a good work. So giving encouragement is something for all Christians, as the apostle Paul showed when he exhorted the brothers to attend congregational meetings: “Not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.”—Heb. 10: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How evident that no Christian has the right to be discouraging! </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Discouragement saps vitality</span><span class="font14">. Discouragement is spiritual chloroform that stifles activity. If one is given a strong enough dose of discouragement, he tends to give up and say, ‘What’s the use of even trying?<sup>1</sup> Encouragement, on the other hand, has a powerfully stimulating effect, spurring one on to do one’s best. Each Christian should consider his obligation regarding “encouraging one another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">Those in positions of oversight must especially be alert to the giving of encouragement</span><span class="font14">. The Chief Overseer, Jesus Christ, sets the example for Christian overseers. When he found it necessary to give reproof and counsel to certain congregations, he was not discouraging. The Chief Overseer is always encouraging. When he reproved the congregation in Ephesus, he said: “I hold this against you, that you have left the love you had at first.” Yet the Chief Overseer encouraged them: “I know your deeds, and your hard work and endurance, and that you cannot bear evil men.” To the congregation at Pergamum he said: “I have a few things against you.” Yet before this reproof, fine encouragement was given: “I know where you are dwelling, that is, where the throne of Satan is, and yet you keep on holding fast my name, and you did not deny your faith in me.” The congregation at Thyatira was counseled for wrong influence by women, but there was also encouragement: “I know your deeds, and your love and faith and ministry and endurance, and that your deeds of late are more than those formerly.” Other congregations were reproved, yet this was done in an encouraging way, to stimulate the spiritually weak ones to wake up and “become watchful.”—Rev. 2:4, 2, 14, 13, 20, 19; 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Seeing that the Chief Overseer gives encouragement, all those in positions of oversight in God’s organization will want to be like their Universal Servant, the Lord Jesus Christ. True, it may be that another person is not working for one, since he is a servant of God, but words of commendation and encouragement are very much appreciated. Usually there is something about which to give encouragement. It may be a good service report for the month, although sometimes it may be good only in one special feature. There is a time for commendation and encouragement regarding meeting attendance, commenting at meetings and caring for Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But let us always remember that encouragement should </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">flow the other way too; </span><span class="font14">that is, toward the overseer. There are many opportunities for those in the Christian congregation to encourage those in positions of oversight. Expressions of appreciation are encouraging. Yes, “encouraging one another” means that no one is excluded from receiving encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Encouragement should also flow both ways </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">between employers and employees, </span><span class="font14">teachers and students, husbands and wives. Though the employer, teacher and husband have special responsibilities regarding encouragement, yet every employee, student and wife can give more thought to giving encouragement, since encouragement should flow in both directions. “Let each of us,” declares the apostle Paul, “please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.”—Rom. 15:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Let Christians, then, be “encouraging one another.” Give thought as to how you can be encouraging. Keep always in mind the example of every Christian’s Universal Servant, Jesus Christ, and the Great </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">En</span><span class="font14">-courager, Jehovah God. Ask yourself: Do I give encouragement?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19610708_files/g_E_19610708-4.png" alt="" style="width:414pt;height:168pt;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If so, how great would be the destruction? What hope would there be for the future?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font14">3E world has been likened to a powder keg with the burning fuse quickly nearing its end. The danger is real and it is growing. It must be faced, for it affects everyone. Indicating that people are not really awake to the danger of today’s situation, columnist David Lawrence wrote recently: “Today a balance of power has been augmented by a balance of terror. Any minute a mistake can be made, and a war started. The danger faced by mankind today is incredible. It defies description. But the paradox is that peoples have not really been awakened to it.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The very existence of civilization is threatened, and voices now call for the awakening of the peoples to this fact. Earlier this year a group associated with the National Planning Association urged the American president to “tell the country the stark, the unvarnished truth about the national emergency.” United States Senator Thomas J. Dodd criticized the government for the “hush-hush that surrounds the neutron bomb.” He said that “to keep the facts of life on the nuclear age from the American people is foolish and potentially dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Under the present circumstances it Is only natural and right that a person be concerned about the future. What are the chances that a war might begin? Could it start by accident? What would it mean to you and your family? Would there be a possibility for survival? How great would be the destruction? Is there any solid hope for the future in view of the world’s present instability?</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Arms Race Creates Danger</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">The nations today are feverishly engaged in a frantic arms race. In order to assure their ability to annihilate totally they spend an estimated $14 million an hour, well over $100 billion a year in creating and producing fiendish weapons of destruction almost too frightful to describe. As a result, former United States president Dwight D. Eisenhower said that “weapons have now come upon the scene that make war as we have understood it in the past a complete absurdity and really impossible and preposterous. They mean, in short—if used in the profusion that prophets sometimes predict—really the destruction of civilization as we know it.” Under these circumstances no one wants war. According to Russian Premier Nikita</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Khrushchev, &quot;Only madmen and maniacs launch calls for a new world war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Just how dangerous are weapons? Is it an exaggeration to say that they can wipe out civilization? Hydrogen bombs now range in explosive power up to more than twenty megatons, with talk of having thermonuclear weapons up to many times that power. A megaton is a term referring to explosive power equal to 1,000,000 tons of TNT. As of last year it was estimated that the United States and Russia possessed thermonuclear weapons equal to about 30 billion tons of TNT, or about ten tons of TNT for every person on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Such tremendous potential for destruction is ever increasing and. it causes many knowledgeable persons to quake with fear at the prospect of what could happen. In a speech last fall Dr. Hugh Keenleyside, former Canadian diplomat and United Nations administrator, warned of the terrible force of nuclear weapons. He said that, according to an estimate, seven properly placed bombs would completely destroy England, and that undenied reports say the United States has 75,000 bombs and is producing 20,000 more of them a year. Russia was assumed to have at least an equal number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Emphasizing the warning, Dr. Keenleyside said: &quot;If there are still any persons who doubt the danger of nuclear bombing perhaps we should recite again the old statistics. The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the equivalent in explosive force of 20,000 tons of TNT. A single 20-megaton hydrogen bomb, the same type of bomb which is produced now, is roughly equal to 1,000 Hiroshima bombs, or is greater in power than the total of explosive energy previously released in the whole history of mankind including that released in the First and Second World Wars. And we are now told that when we get the cobalt bomb we shall have a weapon that will make the hydrogen bomb seem like a firecracker. We are indeed a lovable species.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To appreciate the &quot;balance of terror” one must realize that the nations have the ability to deliver these bombs thousands of miles with great accuracy. Not only do they have the ability, but we are told they are ready for virtually instant firing. In his new book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Soviet Space Technology</span><span class="font14"> Alfred J. Zaehringer estimates that Russia has 100 to 200 international ballistic missiles implanted on bases and that they are “mostly aimed at America.” According to Premier Khrushchev, 250 of these weapons are being produced each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In view of the situation one can appreciate why Khrushchev would say that only a madman or maniac would deliberately embark upon an atomic war. “The danger of suicide is too great for any country to stake its existence upon the dubious results of such a war,” declared former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor. Thus it is hoped that the fear of devastating retaliation will eliminate the possibility of some nation starting a war. This brings us to the burning question of the day, which affects the lives of everyone on earth, and that is: Will this mutual deterrence in the form of devastating retaliatory power create a stable world where peace will flourish? Or will this arrangement prove to be basically unstable? “If it [does],” it was recently said, “and if we follow this path to its end, it is likely that we will perish.”—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Community</span><span class="font14"> o/ </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Fear </span><span class="font14">(1960).</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>The Foolishness of the Arms Race</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">It is becoming ever clearer that the way to preserve the peace is not by preparing for war. Why, if we were to copy the nations in attaining peace with our neighbor it would mean we would have to go out and buy a revolver, and then our neighbor would have to go out and buy a revolver. Then we would have to put our finger on the trigger and hold our revolver at our neighbor’s head, and he would have to put, his finger on the trigger and hold his revolver at our head—then we would have peace! At least that is what world leaders would have us believe by their course of action. How foolish this arms race that has created such a ridiculous, terrifying situation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Premier Khrushchev expressed the fear that in this nervous, tension-ridden world “even those who might not wish to touch off a war could press the wrong button out of sheer fright,” Chief of U.S. Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh A. Burke said that this stand off in nuclear striking power could continue “for generations,” and we would have to learn to live with the possibility “of some madman pressing the button” that would “wipe out the Northern Hemisphere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Paralyzing fear clutches at the hearts of many who come to realize that one mistake could mean a planetary disaster. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font14"> magazine of March 20, 1961, after a brief discussion of the perils of the arms race, concluded: “A world caught up in the nuclear race makes it clear that the search for security through armaments has been in vain. . . . The problem which has begun to haunt the world with increasing urgency is how to keep it from blowing up.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>A War Could Start by Accident</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Nobody wants war, but the pursuit of such a foolish course by the nations has created a situation where a war by accident is not only recognized as possible, but, by increasing numbers of persons, as probable. “These are ghastly speculations, but public opinion has no right to close its eyes to the increasing possibility that an alldestructive nuclear war can break out without anybody deciding to start it,” so summed up an article in the magazine BuZfetin of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">the Atomic Scientists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Charles Orlando Porter, former democratic congressman from Oregon, illustrated it this way: “If you place six chimpanzees in a small room with a couple of baskets of live hand grenades, a minor catastrophe is inevitable. If you place error-prone human beings in proximity to thousands of nuclear weapons, a major catastrophe is inevitable and the triggering of an all-out war is probable.”</span></p>

Barclay’s article, “Can World War III Start by Mistake?” Porter disagreed with the conclusion that “the real danger lies in the future when many countries may possess nuclear weapons.” Porter contended: “The cards are stacked now for vast destruction and death. The facts, simple and undisputed, add up, in my opinion, to World War III in the very near future as the result of an unauthorized or accidental nuclear explosion. This is the war nobody wants and everybody fears. The facts can be stated in a few words. First, thousands of nuclear weapons, many of unthinkable power, exist today. Second, almost all of them are ready for instant detonation. Third, their custodians are human beings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As Russia and the United States vie for territory and prestige, tensions build up, nerves become worn to a frazzle, and the chances increase that a faulty alarm signal or an accidental nuclear explosion will cause someone to press the button sending forth retaliatory missiles that would spark a nuclear war. Already planes loaded with hydrogen bombs have been flushed into the air because a flock of gulls, meteorites, and even the rising moon were mistaken on radar screens for approaching missiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Indicating the existing danger, the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font14"> of April 5, 1961, carried the front-page headlines “M’Namara Urges Steps to Prevent False-Alarm War.” The article pointed out the danger that an ambiguous warning signal might set off a false alarm that could lead to nuclear war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Last summer French president De Gaulle described the situation: “Two camps are set up, face to face, under conditions such that it depends solely on Moscow or Washington whether or not a large part of humanity is wiped out in a few hours.” Consider that in a few years many nations may have nuclear weapons, then instead of two camps having annihilatory power there will be many. An upstart dictator of a small country would then be able to threaten large nations with a missile attack. Like it or not, the chances are all too great that an unbalanced “madman” or “maniac” will get into control and precipitate a nuclear war. 'rhe pages of history indicate that such a possibility amounts to almost an inevitability.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>The Only Hope for the Future</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Some foresee that the selfish pursuit of men for power will drive mankind off the face of the earth. Such ones say our only hope for protection against nuclear war and future survival is to burrow deep within the earth. A report of last year on what the arms race may lead to said: “If the arms race continues, as it probably will, its future pattern seems clear in broad outline. . . . Eventually most human life will be underground, confronted by arsenals capable of destroying all life over the land areas of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, God meant for man to live </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">on </span><span class="font14">the earth, not </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font14"> it. He made earth as man’s home to be taken care of and cultivated to a state of paradisaic beauty, not to be ruined and burned to a cinder by hydrogen and cobalt bombs. Selfish, power-greedy men, if allowed to pursue their present course, would undoubtedly bring this earth to total ruin, annihilating every living creature on it. Be assured this will never happen. Almighty God’s faithful promise is that he will step in and interfere with man’s suicidal race. He will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” —Rev. 11:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The evidence should convince any reasoning person that mankind has reached a time of trouble unparalleled in human history. It is comparable with the days of Noah. Even Nikita Khrushchev’s mind was turned to that time when he spoke last summer concerning Noah’s ark. He said that the risk of total disaster from nuclear warfare could be compared with the flood of Noah’s day. Jesus Christ, who was not simply using picturesque language but who knew what he was talking about, clearly identified this time of unprecedented trouble, and also drew a parallel to Noah’s day. He said: As in the days of Noah, when “they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”—Matt. 24: 37, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Bible prophecy clearly identifies this generation as the one meant for a destruction comparable to the flood of Noah’s day. It will not be a destruction brought by man’s nuclear weapons but by Jehovah God, who will sweep from the earth all wickedness and preserve alive all those trusting in him. So place your hope in Jehovah and his promise of survival! Yes, “be in the fear of Jehovah all day long. For in that case there will exist a future and your hope will not be cut off.”—Prov. 23:17,18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">THE greatest challenge in the health</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font14"> field today is arthritis and rheumatism,&quot; we are told. It is said to affect from 15 to 20 percent of the world's population. It is “the No. 1 crippier” and “the most widespread chronic disease in the United States.&quot;<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">1</a></sup> It causes more disability than all types of accidents. Close to a hundred million workdays are lost yearly due to it, more than the toll taken by any other disease with the exception of mental illness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Each year arthritis claims some 300,000 new victims in the United States, and more than 200,000 are permanently disabled. More persons suffer from it than from cancer, heart disease, tuberculosis and diabetes combined. Farmers appear to be especially susceptible, 23 percent being afflicted. It is also estimated that from 90 to 97 percent of those above sixty years suffer from it, at least to some extent.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>History</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">It is claimed that arthritis is older than the human race, in view of the condition of the fossils of certain prehistoric animals. It is also said to be the oldest known disease of humans, and that it may well be, in view of its marks on so many mummies of the ancient Egyptians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The very term “arthritis,” meaning “inflammation of the joints,” was used in the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">ARTHRITIS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">fifth century before Christ, in the days of Hippocrates, “the father of</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ful joints. The more common name, rheumatism, was first used by one physician Galen in the second century of our Common Era. The root of the word meant a discharge</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19610708_files/g_E_19610708-7.png" alt="" style="width:97pt;height:88pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">or flux or “humor,&quot; which was believed to flow from the brain to various cavities of the body, causing pain. Because these fluids were believed to drop into these cavities the disease was also known as gout, from </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">gutta,</span><span class="font14"> meaning “to drop.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some four centuries after the noted Galen came Alexander of Tralles, who wrote at length on arthritis. Then a millennium later came Paracelsus, a veritable authority on the subject, according to some. Since then each century has seen outstanding physicians keenly interested in arthritis. About a century ago an Irish physician first used the combined form “rheumatic arthritis,” the most severe form today being known as “rheumatoid arthritis.” In modern times arthritis appears to have become more baffling and so we find one of the leading physicians of a previous generation, Sir William Osler, saying: “When an arthritic comes in the front door I want to go out the back door.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Description</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">According to some authorities there are fifty important forms of arthritis and a hundred variations of these. The three most common forms are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Among other forms of arthritis are bursitis, fibrositis and lumbago, while some also include neuralgia, neuritis and sciatica. Without a doubt there is much confusion as to diagnosing arthritis, especially as to what type, even specialists at times being hard put to identify it properly and often even what capable practitioners diagnose as arthritis is proved not to be so by a specialist in the field of diagnosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Osteoarthritis is the most common form and accounts for upward of 50 percent of all cases in the United States. The term is generally agreed to be a misnomer, as the prefix “osteo” means bone and it is not a disease of the bone. A more accurate term would be “degenerative joint disease.” Usually it comes on quite gradually, apparently a part of the aging process, and only in its later stages it becomes painful. It particularly affects the joints sustaining weight, such as the hips and the knees, and is comparatively rare in persons under forty years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Rheumatoid arthritis, about half as prevalent as the degenerative joint disease, represents the greatest challenge as regards arthritic ills. In it there are “abnormal changes of varying degrees in the connective tissues.” Joints, tendons and/or muscles become swollen, tender, hot, red, and, above all, very painful. So sensitive do these parts of the body become that at times the very weight of a bed sheet causes excruciating pain. It appears mostly between twenty-five and fifty years of age, and three out of four victims are women. After sixty years, however, the incidence in the two sexes is the same. Peculiarly, in the type that affects the spine, ten out of eleven victims are men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Characteristic lumps often appear, especially at the elbows. Often the knuckles swell up, whereas in other forms the end joints of the fingers are affected. In longstanding cases every joint in the body may become involved. Muscles gradually weaken and waste away and the skin becomes shiny and smooth. Loss of weight, fatigue and weakness generally go with it. In recent years it is becoming more common among young children, and it is known as Still’s disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Far less common than rheumatoid arthritis is gout. In it the kidneys are obviously involved or affected and nineteen out of every twenty suffering with it are men. It appears most commonly between the ages of thirty and fifty and makes itself felt by swelling of the joints, in particular the big toe.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Causes</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Among the most controversial aspects of arthritis is the question of causes. Says orthodox medicine: “At present, science knows neither the cause nor the cure for arthritis.” One of its researchers recently said: “Sometimes I feel I know everything about arthritis but its cause and cure.” One specialist put the problem like this: “Like the proverbial blind men, we comprehend only small portions of the elephant. It may be that when we know more about it, we shall discover that there is no elephant at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On one thing, however, there does seem to be general agreement, namely, that a predisposition to arthritis is inherited, for the incidence among the relatives of one having it is six times the average. Stress is also a factor to be considered, and among the local causes are “housemaid’s knee,” “tennis elbow” and “golfer’s arm.” In the most common form of arthritis age is a large factor, also obesity. Since three out of four having the more severe kind are women, sex must play an important role. Controversial is the part that metabolism plays as well as smoking tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some attach great importance to psychosomatic factors. But whether these are the cause or the result may be open to question. Thus one report tells that the person most likely to have the severe type of arthritis is likely to be stem, strict with himself and others, stoical, devoted to serving others and deeply concerned with high moral principles. “They seem to have an ever-present desire to do the right thing and a need to live by the Golden Rule. They are meticulous, perfectionistic and over-anticipatory.&quot; </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(Today’s Health,</span><span class="font14"> September, 1957) Interestingly, introverts seem more likely to get this type of arthritis, and, on the other hand, arthritis in general is practically unknown among the insane. There further seems to be considerable evidence that severe emotional stress, such as the loss of a mate, triggers rheumatoid arthritis.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Approaches to Cure</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">As prevalent as arthritis is and as incurable as it has been pronounced to be, it seems incredible that philanthropic foundations would quarrel over who should do the helping, yet that is exactly what happened in 1958 when the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis added arthritis to its list of diseases to combat and could not come to an agreement with the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation. Said a report: “U.S. medicine last week witnessed the strange spectacle of two large, wellmeaning foundations fighting over which has the franchise to help the sick in a large and serious disease field.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The allopathic approach, that of orthodox medicine, while insisting that neither cause nor cure are known, offers hope by means of rest, drugs, reduction of weight in obesity, physical therapy or exercise, proper application of heat and psychotherapy. Among the drugs used are aspirin, colchicine, gold salts and hormones. The latter, however, are being used less and less, as they do not cure and often have harmful side effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Another approach to arthritis is chiropractic, which tells of cures in well over 50 percent of the cases treated. According to its spokesmen, arthritis results from a disturbance of the assimilative and eliminative processes of the body and the best way to remove these disturbances is by adjustment of the spine so as to permit the nerves to function in the best possible manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The homeopathic view is that arthritis is caused by “too much food and/or unsuitable food,” among the latter being too much citrus fruit, especially in cold climates. It considers it adding insult to injury to load the body with toxic painkillers. Homeopathy also holds that each case has its own symptoms requiring its own approach and so prescribes for individual cases, not for diseases. Specific for arthritis are some eighty homeopathic remedies, among the leading ones being Byronia and Rhus tox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then there is the approach of the osteopaths, which may be said to lie halfway between the allopaths and the chiropractors. Osteopathic doctors who specialize in arthritis make use of drugs, diet, exercise, heat, and so forth. However, above all, they stress the need of restoring normal function by correcting postural imbalance through manipulation, by means of osteopathic treatments.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>“Common Sense" and Vitamins</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Common Sense and Arthritis</span><span class="font14"> is the name of a recent best seller in the United States. Written by a layman, its basic theory is that arthritis is caused by fat starvation and so the adding of fats to the diet, in particular taking cod-liver oil in orange juice, will cure arthritis. The author also holds that certain foods work against fats, such as strongly acid fruit juices and carbonated water, and that certain foods, such as sweets, absorb or bum up fats and therefore should be shunned. To aid the body in assimilating fats one should not drink cold water with meals, all drinks should at least be of room temperature, with milk instead of coffee being suggested. The order of eating one’s food is also held important: start the meal with bread and butter and only toward the end of the meal take liquids. Additionally, proper elimination is stressed, and the large sweet Bermuda onion is recommended as an aid in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Vitamins receive much stress by certain advocates of the nature method in dealing with arthritis. They in particular recommend vitamins C and P, and for certain types of arthritis vitamins B<sub>12</sub> and E. Certain raw foods and natural vitamins are therefore prescribed by these. In general “radical blood-purifying and vitalitybuilding measures” are urged, which includes avoiding artificial sweets and refined foods.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Combination Approach</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Perhaps the most unusual approach to arthritis is that of Dr. Bernard Aschner, world-famous rheumatologist, endocrinologist and gynecologist. Says he: “The most successful cures of arthritis [require a] combination of the earlier with the modern medical system.” A member of many leading medical societies, and in practice for some fifty years, he takes strong exception to the modern orthodox approach to arthritis, holds that one hundred years ago doctors did better in treating it than they do now and that much can be learned from primitive medicine men and from folk medicine and lay healers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Aschner holds that arthritis is caused by impurities in the blood, due to overeating, constipation, indigestion, obesity, heavy smoking, fullness of blood and, in the case of women, impure blood due to menstrual malfunction or premature menopause. Among the means he recommends to get rid of these impurities is sweating, raising rashes and blisters on the skin, vomiting and laxatives. Important also, according to him, are certain medicines, including herbs, proper diet (especially to combat obesity), exercise, rest and, in the case of women, normalizing menstrual function if at all possible,—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Arthritis Can Be Cured,</span><span class="font14"> Aschner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While there are more approaches to arthritis, the foregoing are the more' common and more representative. May they prove of some help to the arthritic reader until God’s new world arrives when, we are assured, there will be no more pain, no more arthritis.—Rev. 21:4.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awake!&quot; correspondent in Britain</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font14">F YOU are interested in seeing the past unfold before your very eyes, then visit the British Museum. Especially interesting are the many exhibits confirming or illuminating Bible events, giving us a better idea of its background, its reliability and its preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The museum itself is a great grime-encrusted building with a many-columned ■ facade, which was completed according to the design of Sir Robert Smirke in 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Come join me for a tour. Up the steps and through the revolving doors we go. Upon entering we turn left immediately and start in the Roman Gallery. At the far end, on the right, are the Caesars of Rome. The second one from the end is Augustus, who had the decree sent out for all people to register in their native city; thus Jesus came to be born in Bethlehem instead of Nazareth. Not far away is Titus, who led the Roman armies to the destruction of Jerusalem A.D. 70, an event foretold by Jesus decades earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">From here we go into the Assyrian Transept, easily recognized by the massive winged and human-headed bulls and lions from a palace near Nineveh. In the very center of the floor stands the famous “Black Obelisk.” On each of its four sides are five rows of sculpture depicting various scenes. The second panel from the top shows Jehu, king of Israel, paying over tribute to the Assyrian king. Another Bible character, Hazael of Damascus, is mentioned in the text around the base of the obelisk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Continuing on into the Southern Egyptian Gallery and passing severed large sarcophagi, the Rosetta</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Stone, prominently placed in the center, next attracts our attention. This was the key that unlocked the hieroglyphic writing of the Egyptian priests seen at the top. In the middle is the demotic writing of the common people and at the bottom is the Greek, which could be read quite easily and proved to be a repetition of each of the other two portions above. The inscription was drawn up in 195 B.C.E. in honor of Pharaoh Ptolemy Epiphanes. At the top a group of signs with a line drawn all around in oblongfashion can be seen. That is called a cartouche; it contained the name of the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Turn left near the massive head and shoulders of Rameses II into what is called the Nimrud Central Salon; it almost appears to be part of the Egyptian section. Nearby is a tall slab with a rounded top. It is described as the stele of Shalmaneser III. It mentions the names of both Ahab, king of Israel, and Ben-hadad, king of Syria. That these two kings were in league is evident from the Bible. (1 Ki. 20:31-34; 22:1) Passing between the two-winged human-headed colossi on our left into the Nimrud Gallery, we turn right through a small doorway into the Assyrian Salon and cross to the far right comer where the celebrated bas-relief of the siege of Lachish brings to mind another event recorded in God’s Word. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font14"> Chron. 32:9) The inscription in front of the king reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“Sennacherib, king of all, king of Assyria, sat in his armchair, and the spoil of La-chish passed before him.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Elgin Room</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Retracing our steps, we turn toward the Elgin Room. In the intervening anteroom we are drawn to an excellent model, on the right, of the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Upon this long mass of rock stood the Parthenon, a model of which stands opposite us. Look carefully in the far comer of the Acropolis model, away from the central hill itself, and you will see a little hump marked “Areopagus.” This is the place where the apostle Paul preached to the Athenians. What a view he had! You can just see him stretching out his hand toward all those pagan temples and saying: “The God that made the world and all the things in it . . . does not dwell in handmade temples.”—Acts 17:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Entering the Elgin Room, we note the frieze from the Parthenon running right round the wall. We move on to our left into the Ephesus Room. No directions are needed to find the great column drums, which are the main feature. They come from the Temple of Diana at Ephesus unearthed in 1869. One of the seven wonders of the ancient world, it had more than one hundred columns, each standing over fifty-five feet high. One of these drums alone, the sculptured one on the left, is six feet high and twenty feet in circumference. With its gleaming marble the temple formed a proud center of pagan worship and magnificence.—Acts 19:27.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>The Egyptian Rooms</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">We return once more, through the Elgin Room and anteroom to the large statue of Rameses n. Turning left, we proceed right down the Northern Egyptian Gallery, past a colossal arm from a statue of Thothmes UI, which reminds us of the words of Ezekiel 30:21: “Son of man, the arm of Pharaoh the king of Egypt I shall certainly break, and, look! it will not be bound up at all in order to give it healing.” At the end of the gallery we ascend the northwest staircase and enter the Second Egyptian Room on our left at the top.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What an unusual sight! Egyptian mummies everywhere. The last verse in Genesis tells us that Joseph died and was embalmed and put in a coffin. How accurate the Bible is in reflecting the right background of local life for each land and period! Passing through the Third Egyptian Room filled with many papyri, including the famous Book of the Dead, we enter the Fourth Room. Immediately to our left, in the first wall-case, are some Egyptian bricks in one of which the straw can clearly be seen. (Ex. 5:7, 10-12) A little farther on, wall-cases 141 and 142, are several wooden models of granaries, one with seven compartments, another with three, complete with sliding doors. In making provision for the seven years of famine Joseph must have become very familiar with granaries like these. Not far away is a case of Egyptian metal mirrors. That central one has been polished to show us how effective they could be. “Effective” is the right word. Imagine the women servants making a pile of these for melting down so that the basin and stand could be made for the tabernacle!—Ex. 38:8, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">footnote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Turn to the right into the Sixth Egyptian Room and right again, stopping at the third wall-case. Examine the signet rings displayed in the lower section and inscribed with the names of various Pharaohs. It was a ring similar to these that Pharaoh placed upon Joseph’s hand when he promoted him. (Gen. 41:41, 42) Returning to the Fourth Room, we pass through into the Fifth, to the right. Along one entire side are arrayed many statuettes of Egyptian gods. The ten plagues humiliated several of those included here, for they were proved completely powerless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the next room, the Babylonian, are exhibited many of the finds from the royal tombs at Ur of the Chaldees, once the home of Abraham. The high degree of workmanship impresses us with the realization that here was a civilization of great brilliance.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The Room of Writing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">From the Maya landing we walk through the Prehistoric Room into the Room of Writing. The first wall-case traces the development of the alphabet from the picto-graphic scripts. Note especially the sherd of pottery near the top-left center of the case. This is one of the eighteen Lachish Letters discovered in 1935. These ostraca confirm the Bible record mentioning fire signals (Jer. 6:1) and Lachish’s neighboring town of Azekah (Jer. 34:7), and, above all, they use the four Hebrew letters mb’ (YHWH) of the name of God, Yahweh or Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The second case shows the development of the cuneiform script, and in the following cases many clay tablets, barrels and prisms are on view. In case four, at the top right, is the Taylor prism recording the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib, king of Assyria.—2 Kings 19:1-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the fifth case are some of the famous creation and deluge tablets. The sixth case, at bottom left, contains a model clay liver used for purposes of divination. (Ezek. 21:21) Case eight exhibits a clay tablet in its original clay envelope, and just below you can see several of the Tell el ‘Amama tablets that give evidence of the Israelite invasion of Canaan under Joshua. The last case contains a clay cylinder mentioning Belshazzar, the king that Bible critics for many years said was a myth. It is the third exhibit from the left, on the bottom row. It is interesting to note that oaths were taken in the joint names of Nabonidus and Belshazzar, emphasizing the latter’s authority in the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Crossing the room we have our eye taken by an unusual wall in the corner built entirely of bricks stamped with inscriptions of various Assyrian and Babylonian kings, including Nebuchadnezzar. Next to them is a cast of the famous black stele of Hammurabi, containing one of the most detailed sets of ancient laws known. Though some scholars have argued that the Mosaic law was derived from this code, a comparison shows it is purely civil but that the Mosaic law is morally higher, more humane and with the will of God seen everywhere behind its decrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Next we examine the many cylinder seals in two wall-cases. Each cylinder has a little scene round it; when a clay tablet had been completed the writer would roll his seal over the soft surface, leaving the scene imprinted as his signature. Notice in the first case near the center of the second row that very large Maltese cross. Yes, the cross was frequently used by pagans. In the next case look at the third row, the fourth seal along from the left. You can see at the top the emblem of the god Ashur with three heads on one body. This representation of an Assyrian trinity on a seal was found by A. H. Layard in the ruins of an Assyrian palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the last corner of the Room of Writing is a cast of the Siloam inscription, which reminds us of the tunnel from which it came, made by Hezekiah to bring water up into Jerusalem. (2 Ki. 20:20) Close by is a cast of the Moabite stone, which mentions the name Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">From here we descend to the long and handsome King’s Library. At the far end are two fine manuscripts. The large one in Hebrew, very clearly written in the tenth century A.D., has interesting marginal notes; those at the sides are called the Lesser Massorah, those at the top and bottom are the Greater Massorah, The smaller manuscript in Syriac contains the Pentateuch and is the most important witness for the Peshitta version.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Bible Room</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Entering the Manuscript Salon we notice a case against the wall on our left entitled “Alcuin Bible.&quot; This revision of the Latin </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Vulgate</span><span class="font14"> was made by one Alcuin of York, then Abbot of Tours, and has fine miniatures and illuminated initials. Continuing into the bay, on the left we notice in the far comer a rather indistinct sign reading “Bible Room.’’ In here we find copies of all the principal English versions, from the earlier Wycliffe version in the •center case through to the original edition of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized</span><span class="font14"> or </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">King James</span><span class="font14"> Version of 1611. Early Anglo-Saxon versions are displayed here too. Leaving this little room and following the wall right round to our left again, we next notice the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Lindisfarne Gospels,&quot;</span><span class="font14"> written about A.D. 700 in Northumbria. The whole manuscript, with its ornamentation of a very high artistic quality, is now thought to be the work of one man, Eadf rith of Lindisfarne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On through the door to the left we cross to the large central case. Here are the famous articles of Magna Charta and the Bulls of Pope Innocent in. Close to the Number 1 do you see the bold title? “King John becomes a vassal of the Pope, 1214.” The letters of John are given in the Bull whereby he surrendered his kingdoms to the Roman Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As we turn to leave look to your left. That strong burglar-proof steel cabinet arrests our gaze; it is so different from all the other wooden cases we have seen. Why so? Draw back the curtain over the glass. Yes, here they are! Two of the greatest extant Bible manuscripts right beneath our interested eye—Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Alexandrinus. A fitting conclusion to our tour indeed! Can you imagine the Si-naitic manuscript lying in a waste basket in lonely St. Catherine’s Monastery deep in the Sinai peninsula? That is where keen-eyed Constantine Tischendorf found it, only just in time to prevent one of the greatest Bible treasures from being destroyed. Years later, Tischendorf returned and found the greater part of the manuscript and here it is now, all the way from the fourth century A.D. The Alexandrine, next to it, is of the fifth century, and was presented to King Charles I of England in 1627, just too late to be of use in the preparation of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Leaving the Manuscript Salon by the only other door we have not yet used, we walk through the Grenville Library and emerge again in the Entrance Hall, We cross the Colonnade and pause at the top of the steps. Is it not amazing that we today can travel in two hours through all those dim, distant scenes? It helps us to visualize them better. It also gives us wonderful additional proof of the accuracy of the Bible. Our faith in God, of course, rests on things greater than the things the eye can see, for “all flesh is as vegetation, and all its glory is as a flower of the vegetation; the vegetation becomes withered, and the flower falls off, but the word spoken by Jehovah endures forever.”—1 Pet. 1: 24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">than a happy one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One hot summer day in 1959 mechanization played an unkind trick on 500,000 New Yorkers who will long remember it. In the sweltering heat crucial electric cables burned out, paralyzing five square miles of the city. Air conditioners and refrigerators stopped and television sets stood speechless. For twelve hours repair crews labored to mend the breaks. Dozens of extra police cars crisscrossed the darkened streets to discourage crime. As the power gradually began to return, half a million city folk breathed a sigh of relief. Willing to forgive, they nevertheless find it hard to forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then last January automation became the culprit. Harbor tugs sported highly efficient diesel engines that theoretically could get along with two less men per boat. When the railroads that own the tugs tried to put the theory into practice, 664 maritime workers went on strike. Picket lines appeared at strategic locations and some of the railroads had to shut down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">More than 100,000 annoyed commuters were forced to find another way home or stay in hotels. Food and cargo normally general. The public was distressed to see that a handful of the working force could tie up the City’s life and bring inconvenience and hardship to millions. Experts predict that automation will be doing more of this in the future. According to one report, in the next five years white-collar job losses due to automation will reach 4,000,000. To cope with these problems the American secretary of labor on April 20, 1961, set up the Office of Automation and Manpower.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Trapped</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Hardly was the tugboat strike over when the skies dropped an estimated 40,000,000 tons of snow on New York city. Strings of motorists sat trapped in their multihorsepowered cars. Doctors and ambulances were unable to reach the sick. Milk and fuel deliveries faltered. An emergency milk supply program had to be set up. Empty furnaces produced no heat Giant airplanes were grounded as airports closed. Retail sales dropped and railroads worried about staggering losses. Blocked roads and power failures virtually paralyzed the suburbs. As Operation Snow Shovel proceeded, 6,193 motorists received summonses for defying Mayor Wagner’s auto ban. In turn three car dealers later sued the Mayor and the City for $250,000 m losses resulting from the ban. All this resulted from a snowstorm that was heavy but not a record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The sedate New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font14"> lamented: “We are the slaves of machines: country life, like life in cities, is wedded to electric generators, telephone wires, delivery trucks, gas mains, far-hauled fuel.” In less convenient eras, milk was just a bam away, wood was handy to the stove and mother made her own homemade bread. The larder bulged with home-canned fruits and vegetables, not forgetting the smokehouse and root cellar. When summoned, the family doctor ventured out on snow-covered lanes confident of his one-horse-powered sleigh.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Strangulation by Auto</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Now that the horseless carriage has topped the one-million mark in vehicular murder it is taking on the strangulation of whole cities. London, Los Angeles and New York are among the alarmed. Businessmen know customers will come to town regardless of car fumes, smoke, fog and smog, but traffic-glutted streets are something else. Air commuters especially feel cheated. After fighting their own battle with ticket reservations and plane delays they manage to save precious time coming by jet. Unfortunately, much of the time gained is painfully forfeited on the ground in city traffic. It may be that science will come to the rescue, as Simeon Stylites suggested in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century:</span><span class="font14"> “We have entered a 'disposable era’: disposable dishes, disposable tablecloths, disposable cups. It has even been prophesied that we may in the future be able to unjam traffic jams by having disposable automobiles.” Small cars are becoming popular. Maybe that is a step in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But the hapless fact is that lawn mowers and can openers are getting bigger while autos are getting smaller. Now power mowers are cutting down operators along with the grass. According to Albert Maisel, in a year’s time hospitals in one city treated over 1,000 victims of power mowers. He adds: “As we install more and more appliances, overloaded wiring systems touch off increasing thousands of fires. In our kitchens, filled with electric stoves, broilers, dishwashers, food mixers, can openers and knife sharpeners, accidents now total more than three million a year. Do-it-yourself-ism, insurance men report, results in 600,000 injuries a year. We fall from roofs and ladders, mash and lacerate ourselves with power tools.” It seems our yen for gadgets has opened up a whole new field of “accident-inviting hazards.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With all the gadgets, what does the mechanized housewife do with all her “spare time”? Some say mother is no better off than before, as any time gained is absorbed by community projects. This means she is busier than ever. In her article “Nothing Works but Me,&quot; C. S. Jennison gives another answer: “I can honestly say that I have experienced no real problem in putting my leisure to good advantage. I simply spend the hours saved by half of the helpful gadgets coping with the other half that aren’t functioning. Now and then, I find myself wondering just who is working for whom, but I try not to brood about it.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>&quot;The Ghetto&quot;</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">You may have heard some of those unkind things people have said about housing projects resembling a ghetto. What they meant was that people of the same general income, background and experience are lumped together where they cannot conveniently draw on the varied experience and education of other citizens. What i&amp;more, many city apartments have &quot;cardboard” walls. At least it seems that way to people living next door to a thumping hi-fi set or a boisterous party. Many an urbanite has thought to himself: “How great it would be to move to the suburbs!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now what do you suppose people are saying about life in suburbia? “Too many cardboard walls and too much like a ghetto.” Youngsters trying to sleep have little insulation from the televiewing and entertaining going on in the living room. If that is overlooked, the “ghetto” label is not. Peter Wyden explained what is happening, writing in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Evening Post: </span><span class="font14">“As more parents quit cities, usually ‘for the children’s sake,’ more kids come to live in. neatly manicured, fumeless, pleasantly monotonous bedroom towns where there are almost no old people, no poor, no childless, no Negroes, either many Jewish families or none; no sidewalks, no places to explore except by mother-chauffeured car; no houses or incomes too much different from those of their parents ... In most of these green and gracious places everybody’s business is everybody else’s business, and attitudes are as contagious as flu.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Illustrating the problems of suburban living, the “absentee father,” who spends so much time at business and commuting, leaves the burden of child training to mother. This gives girls a warped view of what a woman’s role is and hinders boys from learning how to be men. For such and other valid reasons a noticeable migration is taking place from suburbia back to the city.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Motion Sickness</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Our love for mobility presents unusual problems. Business organizations like executives who can pull up roots and move at the drop of a new branch office. Thanks to this “executive mobility” whole families can trade in their old acquaintances for new ones every few years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then there is a similar phenomena called “social mobility.” Jhan and June Robbins referred to it recently in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest. </span><span class="font14">It seems that young couples are traveling in social circles far different from the conservative ways of their parents. Cocktail parties and barbecues are the thing today, but as Jhan and June said, “Social mobility also makes it hard to form lasting friendships that sustain social and moral values. When today’s young mothers were girls, their mothers had close friends and confidantes who would lend furniture, recipes or ‘spell you out’ in nursing a sick child. Today, in a society where people move around so much, enduring female friendships seem a thing of the past.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Last, but not least, marriage to machines is changing the very personality of the people. Edward Stein told readers of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century:</span><span class="font14"> “Ours is a time in which we have learned to make machines so much like man in their behavior that they seem almost human. They can calculate, respond, make decisions, run factories, pilot airplanes. . . . Another more subtle and more insidious fact of our day is that in many respects humans are beginning to act like machines. We are in critical ways tending to let ourselves become depersonalized—machine-like in our attitudes 'and behavior. Setting aside the possibility of atomic annihilation, the very real and equally devastating specter of a spiritual leukemia is before us—an inner attrition of man as man, as person . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“As our lives speed up, our very mobility serves to depersonalize us. The person in the car in the traffic lane next to us recedes into a mere wheeled obstacle. The pedestrian in the crosswalk represents nothing more than a frustrating pause on the road. Our relations with our families and neighbors are often fleeting and impersonal. Speed is overvalued. Time is equated with money. Soon people become things to us. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">thou</span><span class="font14"> becomes an it. A cashier becomes a hand-with-money, the clerk becomes a voice-with-answers, the wife a cook-with-sex, the child a nuisance-with-need. The parent acquires in the eyes of his child the dubious status of a disturbing break in the television routine.” Apparently modem man has a bad case of motion sickness. Now at last some are slowing down enough to ask where they are going and why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Recently a committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science warned fellow scientists that with each increase of power, “the problem of directing its use toward beneficial ends becomes more complex, the consequences of failure more disastrous, and the time for decision more brief.” The committee declared that “in the last few years the disparity between scientific progress and the resolution of the social issues which it has evoked has become even greater. What was once merely a gap now threatens to become a major discontinuity which may disrupt the history of man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, the marriage of convenience has come a long way, perhaps too far. Pushbutton missiles launched from the other side of the earth could excavate mankind’s grave within the hour. Machines that were supposed to lift burdens have helped to place a fearful one on mankind. A world that grasped any invention that would give a little more time to live at last has found one that they fear may give it no time at all.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Germ-killing Power of Wine</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">IEPORTS showing that wine has a penicillin-like action on bacteria have re-Icently appeared. What does wine possess that gives it death-dealing power over germs? Is the whole secret in Its alcoholic content? Apparently not, for Professor Salvatore P. Lucia of the University of California School of Medicine writes in Wine </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">as Food and Medicine:</span><span class="font13"> “In comparing the effects of wine with water containing the same amount of alcohol, it has been demonstrated that the bactericidal action of wine is three times greater than that of water containing a similar concentration of alcohol.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">1g </span><span class="font13">What else, then, gives wine its germkilling power? “The antiseptic properties of wine,” says Dr. Lucia, &quot;are in part due to its content of organic acids, particularly lactic acid which in weak concentration has been shown to inhibit the propagation of certain microorganisms. . . . Although it took more than six hours to kill </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">E. typhosus</span><span class="font13"> when the acids of the wine were neutralized, it died in natural wine within fifteen minutes.” Discussing other studies, the professor says; “Remlinger and Bailly acknowledge the bactericidal role of tannins and ethers but are unable, because of lack of data, to assign the mechanism of action which each exerts. Dietze, on the other hand, maintains that the organic acid of wine adds to the germicidal power of the alcohol. The distinct germicidal power exerted by wine of low alcoholic content is due, he contends, to the favorable cooperation of alcohol and acid.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'g? Man apparently has not yet learned the complete secret. “Recent investigations,” says Dr.  Lucia, “have demonstrated that wine possesses antibacterial activity beyond that which can be ascribed to its content of acids, alcohol, tannin or phenols. . . . Wine, next to milk the most complex biologic fluid outside of a blood vessel, with all of its manifold properties resists complete analysis as does the enigma of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Knowing of the antiseptic properties of wine, we can understand the action of the good Samaritan in the illustration given by the Lord Jesus Christ. The Samaritan saw a man who had been left half-dead by robbers; “so he approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine upon them.” —Luke 10; 34.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUTH AFRICA</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BY “AWAKE!&quot; CORRESPONDENT !N SOUTH I</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">C</span><span class="font14">AN South Africa go it alone? That is the question the world, and particularly South Africa, has been asking since Dr. Verwoerd took the Union of South Africa out of the Commonwealth at the London conference during March this year. In a world increasingly bent on signing pacts and agreements on a swim-or-sink-together basis, South Africa is unique in its determination to strike out alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although world opinion is dismayed over South Africa’s determined isolationist policy, which caused the Cape </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font14"> to describe this country as a “lonely little Republic,” Dr. Verwoerd sees South Africa in a happier light. On his return from the Prime Ministers’ Conference he described the Union’s withdrawal as a victory for South Africa. “A higher hand has led us,” he said. “We have done His will; we believe this is better. Let us try to govern our country, both black and white, wisely and well in the interests of all groups.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But Dr. Verwoerd’s optimism was not shared by all South Africans. Although he was given a hero’s welcome on his return from London, with an escort of jet aircraft and a twenty-one-gun salute, there were many deeply troubled South Africans who were not prepared to view the Union’s loss of Commonwealth ties as a major victory. Many South Africans felt that Dr. Verwoerd’s authority, based on a sectional domination of 80,000 votes in a community of 15 million people, hardly placed him in a position to speak for the South African nation. Harry Oppenheimer,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19610708_files/g_E_19610708-10.png" alt="" style="width:134pt;height:101pt;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AFRICA</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">South Africa’s mining magnate and chairman of the Anglo American Corporation, stated that the Union’s withdrawal was a grave, unmitigated misfortune—economically, politically and militarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Dr. Verwoerd’s description of South Africa’s withdrawal as a victory was based on the view that South Africa, like Eire, could become a republic outside the Commonwealth without losing the friendships and privileges of other friendly Commonwealth countries. “We have not lost the friendship of Britain,” said the prime minister, “but have freed ourselves from the pressure of the pro-Asia nations.” During the past few years this anti-South Africa pressure has been building up within the Commonwealth, and when it finally boiled over at the recent conference, Dr.  Verwoerd was convinced that the Union, although a foundation member, was no longer welcome in the Commonwealth. South Africa’s prime minister described the attitude of the Colored and Asian states at the debates as being extraordinarily hostile and vindictive. These states received strong backing from Canada’s Diefenbaker. Basking in the glow of Canada’s newly acquired Bill of Rights, he took a firm stand against South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although Dr. Verwoerd claimed that South Africa’s internal policies should not be a subject for discussion at a Commonwealth conference, the African and Asian states were determined to have the prime minister’s apartheid policy thrashed out at the debates. Kwame Nkrumah said: “If no one else raises the question, I think I shall have to.” In the end it was agreed not to press for a showdown on the Union’s racial laws, but to present South Africa with a communique stating the feelings of the Afro-Asian members. When it was presented, Dr. Verwoerd took exception to this communique and within a surprisingly short while had produced his answer: The Union of South Africa was withdrawing from the British Commonwealth, effective May 31, when it would become the independent Republic of South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Dr. Verwoerd gave his reasons for the Union’s withdrawal as being: First, certain members insisted that in the future South Africa’s color policy could not be regarded as a domestic issue. Secondly, these members wanted the right to move for South Africa’s expulsion at any time in the future. Thirdly, they wished to retain the right to reconsider their own membership if South Africa remained in. On the last point Dr. Verwoerd claimed that, by withdrawing from the Commonwealth, he performed a friendly act toward Britain by releasing her from the embarrassment of having to choose between South Africa and a fellow member.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, Afro-Asian members felt that Dr. Verwoerd’s friendly spirit could have been better demonstrated had he agreed to accept into South Africa diplomatic representatives from Colored Commonwealth states. His refusal, they claimed, was a major reason for their attack on South Africa. But since his return to the Union Dr. Verwoerd has denied that he gave an outright refusal to Colored diplomatic missions to South Africa. He had pointed out at the conference that there were already certain representatives of non-white countries in the Union; and that India, which was at one time represented in South Africa, had of its own accord withdrawn its representatives. What the proAsian states really wanted, continued Dr. Verwoerd, was to have South Africa taken away from the white man and from the Western nations.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Counting the Cost</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">To members of the “club” the Commonwealth bond is something of value. It means imperial preferences, trade agreements, financial aid, pooled ideas in the scientific, mining, industrial, educational, and agricultural fields; greater freedom of the individual to travel and settle in Commonwealth countries, a measure of support at the United Nations; and most important of all, membership brings military and defense pacts as well as the exchange of political and diplomatic information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The combination of such a diversity of people with such a variety of governments, from self-governing dominions, crown colonies and protectorates, to independent states and republics, has no parallel in the world’s political history. It has been reported that Commonwealth members totaled one quarter of the earth’s population, or 86 million whites and 600 million coloreds, their countries covering one quarter of the earth’s surface and handling one quarter of the world’s trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A quick look at South Africa’s former position in the Commonwealth trade picture shows that Britain has been the Union’s best customer, to the extent of £106 million yearly, with total British investment in the Union at £950 million. The Commonwealth market took 70 percent of South Africa’s fruit, and half its wine and brandy. South Africa’s sugar industry received an annual boost of £3 million through the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In an effort to balance the books, spokesmen for the Union government point to South Africa’s trump card, her gold and diamond mines. While the loss in the gold market since the Commonwealth break amounts to 20 percent in her gold shares, South Africa is still the world’s biggest gold producer, with an output of £262 million a 'year, and has a diamond industry valued at £15 million a year. They also point out that the Union’s economic progress is not based on foreign capital; less than one tenth of its exports depended on imperial preferences, and loss of trade with African states accounts for only one or two percent of her total production. Determined to expand her trade throughout the world and to offset the loss of any Afro-Asian customers, South Africa is busy exchanging trade delegates with Japan, Italy and West Germany. Even Russia has been mentioned as suitable trading ground.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>East versus West in Africa</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">The suggestion that trade with a Communist country would be acceptable seems to be at variance with South Africa’s strong anti-Communist policy. Dr. Verwoerd has claimed all along that his country’s lone white struggle at the foot of black Africa is not just a fight to keep the Union white, but a last-ditch stand to keep communism out of Africa. His objection is not so much to freedom for the black man or self-government for African states, but to the danger of communism in underdeveloped newly independent African territories. South Africa’s Suppression of Communism Act, her four-year-long Treason Trial, and her expulsion of Russian diplomats all speak of her deep-rooted fear of communism. In view of this, only time will show whether the Union can successfully open her back door to trade with Russia, while keeping her front door firmly closed against Russian political power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The irony of the Union’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth is highlighted by the firm belief of Dr. Verwoerd and his political followers that it was South Africa, that self-styled bulwark against communism, that was thought to be expendable in the East versus West struggle for power in Africa. The view was expressed by the French paper </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Parisienne Liberte </span><span class="font14">that by associating herself with the communique denouncing apartheid, Britain had made a choice and sacrificed the Union to her African and Asian partners. Putting it more bluntly, the Afrikaans paper </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Die Volksblad</span><span class="font14"> said: “If South Africa is kicked out of the Commonwealth she will be the victim of the race between East and West for the favour of the uncommitted non-white nations in Africa and elsewhere. We have already seen in Northern Rhodesia to what extremes even Britain is prepared to go in this race.” Pointing to Britain’s failure to support white supremacy in Rhodesia, the Afrikaans press further comments: “Britain came out of the second world war a second-rate power, increasingly dependent on blood drawn from the Commonwealth. In trying to appease Coloured members, Britain regarded Whites who have no other home but South Africa, as expendable, as has happened in Kenya and Rhodesia.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Wfto </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After South Africa’s breakaway, several uneasy, over-the-shoulder glances showed that a number of Conference delegates felt that an unhealthy precedent had been set for an annual witch hunt. Using this term, Sir Roy Welensky, the prime minister of the Rhodesian Federation, said he was gravely disturbed by the new tendency in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Conference to discuss one another’s internal affairs. He added that the Union’s departure threatened to put the rest of the Commonwealth in the “somewhat remarkable position” that the smaller countries of the Commonwealth might be in the position to dictate policy when they had neither the economic means nor the force to carry it out. He felt that there was hardly any part of the Commonwealth that did not have a skeleton of some kind in the cupboard. No question would now be excluded from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ conference table. “Now what is there to stop the Kashmir problem being discussed, or Australia’s no-Japanese policy?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Hinting at his own policy, Menzies of Australia said after the break: “I am not an apostle of apartheid—also I have my own immigration policy—but I am bound to say that I would not have left the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ Conference later than Dr. Verwoerd left it. Don’t let us have humbug. I would not tolerate being lectured by other people. There would not be any Commonwealth if it becomes a court with people on trial, because we shall expel each other. If people started telling me what Australia’s internal policy should be, I would tell them to jump into the Serpentine.’’ He further stated that the Commonwealth was not a subdivision of the United Nations, and that he thought it was “monstrous for members of the Commonwealth to sit in judgment upon one another.” After commenting on Dr. Verwoerd’s bearing, integrity and courtesy during the Conference, Menzies concluded: “We now have to adopt the rule that when we meet we are on trial. Next time it may be Australia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not only is the question being asked: Who will be next to face the inquisitor’s table? but, Who will be next to be shown the door? On his return from London Dr. Verwoerd expressed the opinion that South Africa’s departure ■ was the beginning of the Commonwealth breakup. Also suggesting that this might be the case, the League of Empire Loyalists said in a letter to Mr. Macmillan: “As a result of the present meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, the Cyprus of Archbishop Makarios has been admitted to membership while the South Africa of Dr. Verwoerd has been insulted and driven to resignation.” The letter also stated that it wished to draw attention to the slogan of “you and your Cabinet colleagues—‘The British Empire is not breaking up—it is growing up.’ &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Whether this junior edition of the United Nations breaks up or grows up, the only remedy for the distress of mankind lies, not in its political organizations, but in the righteous kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">accuracy in daily speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Stressing the importance of accuracy in daily speech for the public speaker, the letter writer and all others who must occasionally put down thoughts on paper, George Herbert Palmer says in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Self-Cultivation in English;</span><span class="font13"> “It is commonly supposed that when a man seeks literary power he goes to his room and plans an article for the press. But this is to begin literary culture at the wrong end. We speak a hundred times for every once we write. The busiest writer produces little more than a volume a year, not so much as his talk would amount to in a week. Consequently through speech it is usually decided whether a man is to have command of his language or not. If he is slovenly in ninety-nine cases of talking, he can seldom pull himself up to strength and exactitude in the hundredth case of writing. A person is made up in one piece, and the same being runs through a multitude of performances. Whether words are uttered on paper or to the air, the effect on the utterer is the same. Vigor or feebleness results as energy or slackness has been in command,”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INSECT WORLD "British" </span><span class="font14">of these beautiful insects has captured the imagination of men down through the ages. Ancient paintings of the Orient and very old New Mex-ican pottery, for instance, depict dragonflies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">land of nature is an insect that is trans-formcd into a thing of radiant brilliance only when its life is nearly over. At all stages of its life this insect is truly a “dragon” to other insects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, the dragonfly looks fierce even in flight, and fiercer still when viewed close up. Some people are a little wary of this agile and glistening creature, with its beautiful gauzy wings and brilliant colors. This fear no doubt explains why, in different localities, it is saddled with quaint names, such as devil’s darning needle, sewing needle, horse stinger, mosquito hawk, bee butcher, snake feeder and snake doctor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A lover of water, the dragonfly spends most of its life in larval and nymph stages under water. So wherever there is fresh water, in ponds, lakes, streams and swamps scattered around the world, dragonflies are found in due season according to their species, which number more than 2,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">If we could simultaneously glimpse one specimen of each species, letting our eyes absorb in one sweeping look the multiplicity of sizes and dazzling colors, we would be held spellbound. Here, for instance, are dragonflies with bright-red bodies and wings splashed with carmine or gold and black. There, a black-bodied creature striped with yellow and with wings touched with gold. We would note, with deepening interest, still others in which the thorax is grass green in color and the abdomen</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Life Under Water</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">Life for the dragonfly begins as an egg, deposited under water. From the egg emerges an active long-bo died creature, not unlike a caterpillar. Although it sheds its skin a dozen times or so as it matures, the nymph retains the large, hinged lower lip at the tip of which are two enlarged jointed hooks or jaws. It is this powerful and formidable apparatus that enables the nymph to eat to repletion, thus earning for itself the title of “the tyrant of the pool.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">How apt its title! As the nymph crawls over the floor of its native home it looks so innocent and harmless that other pool dwellers unsuspectingly allow its guileless approach, unaware that its “mask” (the hinged lower lip folded over its face) is really a formidable food-catching weapon. When the mask is whipped off, it is much too late to escape! Soft-bellied creatures such as tadpoles are its favorite food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We can imagine the nymph crawling among the debris at the bottom of a pond. True, its legs are not adapted for swimming, yet it can swim slowly or with darting motion when it wishes. This it does by expelling water through the openings at the tip of its abdomen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After one to three years in the nymph stage and after shedding skin after skin, the time comes when maturity is reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Instinctively the creature climbs out of the water up a plant stem. For the last time the skin cracks and slowly the dragonfly pulls itself free from its soft, damp body. This is the final breath-taking miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This final transformation is indeed an enthralling spectacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As its rapidly beating heart pumps fluid through its body, the abdomen gradually stiffens and dries while the weak and crumpled wings take on shape and strength and are displayed in all their delicate beauty.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>From the Realm of Fish to That of Birds</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">the dragonfly is now a mature adult— and ready for another meal! Well equipped indeed is this lovely creature for locating and eating an endless array of living victims—gnats, flies, midges, mosquitoes (in both their larval and adult stages), dayflying moths and only an occasional butterfly, since some butterflies possess an odor and taste highly offensive to the dragonfly’s palate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">An outstanding characteristic of the dragonfly, and a major weapon in its armament, is its huge and fierce-looking eyes that cover almost all its head. Comprising some 20,000 facets or sight units, the eyes are curved so as to allow the insect to see in all directions at once, enabling it to distinguish both prey and foe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And how delicately beautiful are the wings! Transparent, cellophane-thin and braced with a network of veins, they extend rigidly from the body while the dragonfly is at rest, becoming a blur of color </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font14">motion. While some species have a wingspread of six or seven inches, the average is around two to four inches.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Versatility and Superstitions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">the dragonfly resembles a streamlined racing plane. One timed with a stop watch was traveling down a valley at sixty miles an hour. It is also an outstanding longdistance traveler. Migrations of two hundred miles or so have been recorded, proving that the dragonfly is capable of powerful, sustained flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Versatile, the dragonfly is at times a racing plane, at other times a helicopter. It can twist and turn, shoot straight up, hover, even move backward on the wing. This Versatility is just fine for capturing prey. Its prey spotted, it swoops upon it with incredible speed, using its front legs as a basket to scoop up dinner in flight. Munching on its prey while airborne, the dragonfly works its stout jaws in sidewisefashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">No wonder this beautiful if hungry creature is a source of strange and false beliefs. Some of the foolish superstitions are that dragonflies kill mules, sew up children’s ears and sting people. Such beliefs have no foundation in fact, since dragonflies cannot sting. And they do not sew up the mouths and ears of children nor the toes of barefooted sleeping fishermen. the dragonfly is a harmless, beneficial insect, destroying so many pests in a half hour that it sometimes consumes its own bulk in captured prey. Flying ecstatically through a swarm of mosquitoes, the dragonfly’s mouth is sometimes so full it cannot close its jaws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Truly the insect that inspires such strange beliefs and that lives only a quarter of its life as an adult dragonfly is one of nature’s curiosities, a “dragon of the air.”</span></p><img src="g_E_19610708_files/g_E_19610708-12.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:120pt;">
<p><span class="font14">the dictionary defines “resurrection” as A “the rising again from the dead; the resumption of life by the dead.”—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">the teaching of the resurrection is unique with the Bible. the idea was so strange to the philosophers assembled on Mars’ Hill that Paul’s mention of it broke up his public lecture: “Well, when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to mock, while others said: ‘We will hear you about this even another time.’ Thus Paul left their midst.”—Acts 17:32, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But this teaching did not sound strange to Jewish ears, for the Hebrew Scripture writers, such as Moses, David, Isaiah and Hosea, plainly testify to a resurrection of the dead. And it is especially made prominent in the Christian Greek Scriptures by the teachings of Jesus and the writings of his apostle Paul.—Mark 12:18-27; Ps. 16: 10; Isa. 25:8; Hosea 13:14; John 6:54; ICor. 15:3-58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the dead at a time which will please the Creator, blessed be his name.” Thus Maimonides expressed the belief of most Jews until in modem times some succumbed to higher criticism and became known as Reform Jews. These dropped their belief in the resurrection and adopted the widespread belief in soul survival. Most sects of Christendom inconsistently profess to believe in both soul survival and the resurrection of the dead. However, if the human soul lives on, why a resurrection? the Reform Jews at least feel they have logic on their side, they appreciating that it is a matter of believing either in the soul’s survival after death or in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Is the Bible responsible for this contradiction? Does it, on the one hand, teach that at death man continues to live </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">on in </span><span class="font14">some other state and, on the other hand, assure us that there will be a resurrection of the dead? No, regardless of what men may believe and teach, the Bible does not contradict itself. Since it plainly tells of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font14">resurrection for the dead, it can not and does not teach that the dead continue to live on and only appear to die. On the contrary, it plainly tells us that the soul dies and that the dead are really dead: “For </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font14">death there is no mention of you; in Sheol who will laud you?” “What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheol?” “Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground, in that day his thoughts do perish.”—Ps. 6:5; 89:48; 146:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Clearly supporting the foregoing is the argument of the apostle Paul. In his chapter on the fact of the resurrection he, for example, makes this point: “If, indeed, there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised up. Further, if Christ has not been raised up, your faith is useless, you are yet in your sins. In fact, also, those who fell asleep in death in union with Christ perished. If in this life only </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font14">have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.” But if the soul lived on after death, and went to heaven, hell </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font14">purgatory, it would not matter whether there was a resurrection or not.—1 Cor. 15:13,17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Among the resurrections of the past that </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font14">Bible tells us about are one each by Elijah and Elisha; two by God directly, the man whose corpse touched the bones of Elisha and came to life, and Jesus Christ; three by Jesus Christ and one each by Peter and Paul. But no doubt many more were resurrected, at least during the time of Christ, for he sent the twelve forth to “raise up dead persons.” They must have raised up some, and since nothing is mentioned about specific instances we may safely conclude that not all those that Jesus himself raised from the dead were recorded.—Matt. 10:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">God's Word speaks of a “first resurrection,&quot; limited to but Jesus Christ and the 144,000 who are to be priests and kings with him. (Rev. 14:1; 20:5, 6) It is first in time and importance. After telling of the resurrection of such favored ones, Revelation, chapter twenty, tells of the sea, death and Hades giving up their dead. This is in keeping with Jesus’ words about all those in the memorial tombs, both those who did good things and those who practiced vile things, coming forth to a resurrection. the apostle Paul also told of the resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.—Rev. 20:12, 13; John 5:28, 29; Acts 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Coming now to the expression, “better resurrection.” It appears at Hebrews 11: 35, where we read: “Women received their dead by resurrection; but other men were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection.” Obviously here reference is made to the faithful men who lived before the time of Christ. They will receive a better resurrection than what those experienced who were mentioned in the earlier part of the same verse, those who were raised from the dead by the prophets. In what sense? In that those resurrected back there died again, but these faithful ones to be resurrected in the future will be resurrected by Jesus Christ without the unavoidable need to die again, because it will be under the rulership of the Son of God, and he is to rule until he has put all his enemies under his feet, the last enemy to be destroyed being death. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These faithful men are among those having done good things, as mentioned by Jesus Christ, and among the righteous ones receiving a resurrection, as mentioned by the apostle Paul. It is reasonable to conclude that these will receive an earlier resurrection than those unrighteous ones who did vile things. Especially so in view of the promise that some of these will be among the princes Jesus Christ will appoint in all the earth.—Ps. 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Comparing these faithful ones of old with those of the “body of Christ,” who will share in the first resurrection, the writer of Hebrews says: “Yet all these, although they had witness borne to them through their faith, did not get the fulfillment of the promise, as God foresaw something better for us, in order that they might not be made perfect apart from us.” In other words, these faithful men of old will be assisted to attain to perfection by those sharing in the first resurrection. So those who share in the first resurrection are recipients of something even better than what those faithful men of old will receive.—Heb. 11:39, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Thus we see from God’s Word that the dead are dead and their hope lies in a resurrection; that in times past an unknown number of persons were raised from the dead; that there is a first resurrection for those who receive the heavenly reward; that these, therefore, will have something better than will the faithful men of old, who, in turn, however, will experience a far better resurrection than did those who were resurrected In ancient times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Race Troubles</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Violence has erupted again among the colored and whites in the southern United States. Edward Fl. Murrow, director of the United States Information Agency, pointed out that such events are &quot;absorbed, debated and pondered on all shores of every ocean.” Murrow also pointed to the treatment of representatives of new African nations in Washington, D.C.: &quot;Landlords will not rent to them; schools refuse their children; stores will not let them try on clothes; beaches ban their families. Today there are some thirty African representatives in Washington without what is euphemistically called ‘satisfactory housing.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; According to a survey made by the Census Bureau, New York is the United States' largest city and is also its most crowded, with 24,697 persons per square mile. Chicago and Philadelphia follow, both having nearly 16,000 Inhabitants per square mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Delinquency’s Cause</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Broken homes, working mothers, mental retardation, lack of playgrounds and bad companions have all been listed as major causes for delinquency. However, according to psychologist and educator Dr. William Kvaraceus, discord and lack of love in the home is the primary cause. “the juvenile delinquent,&quot; he said, &quot;is a person who has no feeling of belonging.” Police inspector Ralph Boot said in agreement that he felt purposelessness is what most characterizes a delinquent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Death on the Highways</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Highway accidents killed 38,000 persons and injured 3,078,000 in the United States in 1960. Studies compiled by the Travelers Insurance Companies show that more than 30,000 of these deaths and 2,600,000 of the injuries could be blamed on traffic violations. Pedestrians crossing the street did not make it on more than 170,000 occasions during 1960. Dead after being struck down by a car were more than 5,000 persons, while more than 165,000 were injured.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On May 26, in commemoration of the thirty-fourth anniversary of Charles Lindbergh’s historic nonstop New York-to-Paris flight of May 20-21, 1927, a U.S. B-58 jet bomber made the same trip in a recordbreaking 3 hours 19 minutes and 41 seconds. It averaged about 1,050 miles an hour, Lindbergh took thirty-three and a half hours to cover the same distance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Church Indicted</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A survey in Huddersfield, England, which interviewed 1,273 people, showed that 25 percent of the men were definitely not interested in religion, compared to 14 percent of the women who professed no interest. However, of those interviewed 87 percent believed in God and 83 percent said they would call themselves Christian. Minister Frank Thewlis observed that of those not connected with the church, 57 percent had been to Sunday school as children and only 4.7 percent had never had any con- -nection with a church. “This is a stinging indictment of our church life,” Thewlis said “At one time or other we have had most people under pur wing, but we have lost them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Decency Popular</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Phillip B. Gilliam, Denver, Colorado, judge for the past twenty-five years, said that &quot;the biggest challenge to America is to make decency popular. We need some angry Americans, people who will get sore about wrongdoing. But who gets sore today?&quot; Judge Gilliam, who has 80 to 90 unwed mothers appear before him every month, half of them under 21 years of age, said that to prevent delinquency in children parents should give &quot;them a lot of discipline . . . Give them attention. Don't say, 'Get out of my life, I don't have time for you.’” He warned: “You’d better do something about making good Americans. the experts on the other side have got it all figured out how to make bad ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">New York’s Busy Harbor</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During 1960 more than seventy-three ocean-going ships entered and left the port of New York every day on the average. This amounted to a total of 26,977 ships, compared to 27,260 in 1959.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&lt;&amp; During 1960 some 22,000,000 pounds of bulk aspirin were produced in the U.S., which is twice the output of ten years ago. During these years consumption of pain-easing pills has increased four times as fast as the population growth. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">Federal Trade Commission, in a crackdown on false advertising claims, said that “there is no significant difference in the rate of speed with which these or any other analgesics relieve pain.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Social workers and psychiatrists in Britain are frequently confronted with the Joneses disease. “It’s the name we have given to the mental breakdowns caused by the race to keep up with the neighbours socially,” explained John Wilder, of the Institute for Group Society Development.</span></p>

One of them, Richard Fife, a fourth grader, was asked by the minister whether he understood what he was doing. &quot;Until now,” replied Richard, &quot;I have always been on the side of the robbers, but from now on, I’m on the side of the cops.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Religious Illiteracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">® On May 3 the president of the Princeton Theological Seminary, Dr. James I. McCord, told an assembly at Southern Methodist University that today’s preaching is “producing a generation of religious illiterates.” Regarding the failure of the “ministry of the laity,” he said: &quot;Too often ministers take the laymen, put them in the church and squeeze all the enthusiasm out of them, leaving mere ‘corpses’ along the way.” “If the church is to make a difference,&quot; said Dr. McCord, “it faces its most formidable education mission since the days when Constantine set out to educate the Graeco-Roman world regarding Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Early Bible Texts Studied</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$■ A study of early Bible texts is being conducted under the direction of Scholar Bonifatius Fischer at the Vetus Latina Institute of the Benedictine monastery of Beuron in southern Germany. Of particular interest are 400 boxes containing 1,000,000 quotations from ancient parchments, which were given to the monastery in 1927 by Catholic priest Joseph Denk. the object of the task is to compare these many early Scripture parchments with the Latin </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Vulgate</span><span class="font13"> produced by Jerome, from A.D. 382 to 404. “What we are doing here,” said Fischer, “is research into the basis of our spiritual world, to gather whatever has been left intact from the old Latin Bible texts that caused Christianity to sweep </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">like wildfire </span><span class="font13">through </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">an</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">tique world” </span><span class="font13">&quot;So far,” he said, “the real surprise is not how much </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font13">rather how little </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">essential difference there</span><span class="font13"> is between the basic spiritual content of all the versions, despite linguistic and local differences.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; On May 11 Purdue university students expressed themselves at the third quadrennial convocation of Methodist deaconesses at Purdue. They showed that the church has failed to meet the needs of today’s youth. </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font13">Purdue sophomore said that he did not like the attitude that people have of going to church on Sunday for prestige. N or did he appreciate the fact that his hometown church spent more on maintenance than it did on missions and benevolences. Anita Allison, a mathematics senior, pointed to the class distinctions among the churches and challenged the church’s practice of what she termed “lip service to race relations.&quot; Penny Morrison told the 400 deaconesses present that youth needs to be told about their religion in words that they can understand. She said she did not believe that the Bible was something to be read “like a biological textbook” or “to be thumped while making a point.” What “we want,” she said, is for “you to tell us intelligently about the love of God. We want answers, truth— not bedtime stories. We can’t believe the answers are in spoon-fed theology. She asked: “If the love of God is so wonderful, why are so many of you frowning so much of the time?” As an adult, are you meeting the needs of youth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting Hands Clean</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; According to Dr. Robert F. Cavitt of Kansas City, It </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font13">scrubbing and not the soap </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">that cleans the hands</span><span class="font13"> of transient microbes. He said that experiments revealed that simple washing with antiseptic soaps “is of little benefit in </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font13">moving these organisms” and may give physicians and </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">nurses </span><span class="font13">&quot;a false sense </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font13"> security.” ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Trujillo Assassinated</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;*&gt; On the night of </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">May 30 </span><span class="font13">Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo’s thirty-one-year dictatorship of the Dominican Republic came </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">to a bloody end</span><span class="font13"> as he was attacked and killed while en route between his home in San Cristobal and Ciudad Trujillo. An army general, seeking revenge, was reportedly responsible for the assassination.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>
