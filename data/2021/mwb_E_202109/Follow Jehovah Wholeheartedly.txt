TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
Follow Jehovah Wholeheartedly




Caleb followed Jehovah wholeheartedly early in life (Jos 14:7, 8)
Caleb later trusted in Jehovah to fulfill a difficult assignment (Jos 14:10-12; w04 12/1 12 ¶2)
Caleb was rewarded for his wholehearted service to Jehovah (Jos 14:13, 14; w06 10/1 18 ¶11)





Caleb grew in faith as he followed Jehovah’s direction and experienced His blessing. We too are strengthened to continue in Jehovah’s service as we receive answers to our prayers and see his guidance in other ways.​—1Jo 5:14, 15.
