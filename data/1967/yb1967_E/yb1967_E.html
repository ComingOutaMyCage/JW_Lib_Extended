<p><span class="font4">1967 YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There must have been something about this man walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee to make four hardworking fishermen leave their occupation and follow him. Had these fishermen ever seen or heard of this man before? Did they know who he was? Indeed they did! They were well prepared to go when the call came: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.” How was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This man, Jesus, had been baptized the preceding year (29 C.E.) by John the Baptist. At that time John saw the holy spirit coming down out of heaven and remaining on this Jesus. So later he told his hearers: “I have borne witness that this one is the Son of God.” (John 1:34) John spoke right, for the record tells us: “After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him. Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’ Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he felt hungry.” (Matt. 3:16^4:2) Now three temptations were cleverly put before Jesus by Satan. However, Jesus Christ remained true to his heavenly Father and finally said: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">to him alone you must render sacred service.’ ” —Matt. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now after this experience Jesus came walking toward John the Baptist, and it was quite natural for him to point to Jesus and say: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!” The next day two of these Galilean fishermen met Jesus. How? That day “John was standing with two of his disciples, and as he looked at Jesus walking he said: ‘See, the Lamb of God!’ And the two disciples [of John] heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.” Fisherman Andrew was one of the two that said to Jesus: “Rabbi, . . . where are you staying?” “And they stayed with him that day.” Andrew then “found his own brother, Simon, and said to him: ‘We have found the Messiah’ (which means, when translated, Christ). . . . When Jesus looked upon him he said: ‘You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Cephas’ (which is translated Peter).” The next day Jesus desired to depart for Galilee. “So Jesus found Philip.” He was from the same city as Andrew and Peter.—John 1:29, 35-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From this we see that John’s disciples wanted to get acquainted with Jesus and did. At least two of the fishermen to whom Jesus later said: “I will make you fishers of men,” met him first at the Jordan River. Many people knew what John had said about Jesus, that he was the Son of God, the Messiah. It was quite natural, then, foi’ them to want to hear what Jesus had to say. Let us travel a little while with Jesus and see what he does after first getting acquainted with Andrew and Peter and Philip and other disciples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus left the upper Jordan valley and came to Cana of Galilee, where a marriage feast took place. The mother of Jesus was there and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to this wedding celebration. It so happened the wine ran short, and here Jesus performed his first miracle, turning water into wine. This miracle was “the beginning of his signs, and he made his glory manifest; and his disciples put their faith in him.” (John 2:1-11) All these things had happened during the first six months since Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan River.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now it is Passover time in the spring of the year 30, and Jesus goes to Jerusalem. In this holy city he showed his indignation toward those who were turning the house of his God into a business place. “He found in the temple those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats. So, after making a whip of ropes, he drove all those with the sheep and cattle out of the temple, and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he said to those selling the doves: ‘Take these things away from here! Stop making the house of my Father a house of merchandise!’ His disciples called to mind that it is written: ‘The zeal for your house will eat me up.’”—John 2: 13-17; Ps. 69:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then one night Jesus received a visitor, Nicodemus, a Pharisee who was anxious to hear what this teacher from God had to say. Among other things, Jesus pointed out that “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. For God sent forth his Son into the world . . . for the world to be saved through him.” (John 3:16, 17) He further showed that faith in the true God is necessary and that the one “that does what is true comes to the light, in order that his works may be made manifest as having been worked in harmony with God.” (John 3:1-21) After this most interesting night meeting “Jesus and his disciples went into Judean country, and there he spent some time with them and did baptizing. But John also was baptizing in Aenon neai' Salim.” “When . . . the Lord became aware that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John—although, indeed, Jesus himself did no baptizing but his disciples did—he left Judea and departed again for Galilee.”—John 3:22, 23; 4:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people and religionists observed this great activity because now Jesus’ disciples were baptizing and John the Baptist was still baptizing. But they observed many more were now following Jesus. In fact, some of John’s disciples said ‘all were going to Jesus.’ John very carefully explained that he was not the Christ but that he was sent forth in advance of the Christ. Then John made a very significant statement, which showed his real, true love for Jesus, the Christ or Anointed One: “He that has the bride is the bridegroom. However, the friend of the bridegroom, when he stands and hears him, has a great deal of joy on account of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore this joy of mine has been made full. That one must go on increasing, but I must go on decreasing.”—John 3:25-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus did increase his disciples and many Jews were following him. “Now after John was put under arrest Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the good news of God and saying: ‘The appointed time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Be repentant, you people, and have faith in the good news.’” (Mark 1:14, 15) Matthew confirms this, for he says: “The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.’ From that time on Jesus commenced preaching and saying: ‘Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ ”—Matt. 4:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now John’s public work was done. He had announced the one who must go on increasing, and after John’s imprisonment Jesus immediately took up the message concerning God’s kingdom. Then he went to Nazareth and read his commission from Isaiah, the sixty-first chapter, to all in the synagogue on the sabbath day. “So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed him, and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written: ‘Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.’ With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed upon him. Then he started to say to them: ‘Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.’ ”—Luke 4:17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not being accepted in his own territory, he went down to Capernaum a city of Galilee. “And he was teaching them on the sabbath; and they were astounded at his way of teaching, because his speech was with authority.” (Luke 4:31, 32) By this time in Jesus Christ’s ministry there must have been many very attentive listening disciples, learners, but none as yet were called to do the work Jesus was doing. He was carrying on a real teaching program, instructing his disciples to be ready to take on responsibility. Now the time came to select and train certain ones for future work. Whom did Jesus choose first?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DID THEY KNOW WHO HE WAS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So Peter and Andrew and their companions had gone back to fishing. While Jesus was walking alone along the Sea of Galilee near Capernaum, well after Passover of 30 C.E., “he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, letting down a fishing net into the sea, for they were fishers. And he said to them: ‘Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.’ At once abandoning the nets, they followed him. Going on also from there he saw two others who were brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.” (Matt. 4:18-22) There was not the slightest hesitation to the call on the part of these four fishermen. Like the prophet Isaiah, centuries previously, in their hearts they said: “Here I am! Send me.” (Isa. 6:8) They were ready to go because they knew who Jesus was. This was not the first time they had seen him or heard his word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Remember, Andrew and a companion stayed with him one evening, almost a year before, and Peter met him when Andrew his brother said to Peter: “We have found the Messiah.” They could have been some of his disciples who were at the marriage feast in Cana. If not with him, surely they heard about Jesus’ cleaning out the money changers in the temple at Jerusalem the following Passover season (30 C.E.). The news about his reading Isaiah’s prophecy at Nazareth a little while before now and his being run out of town surely got to their ears. Without doubt they listened to his teaching with authority at Capernaum. These four disciples knew who he was and were ready to follow him. They did not go into this new work as ministers of God without knowing what Jesus was preaching and without believing the kingdom of the heavens was at hand! They were ready and anxious to get into the ministry, as every man and woman should be today who has heard the Word of God and believes in the kingdom of God as the only hope for mankind. Do you have knowledge of God’s Word and faith that qualifies you to be a minister? Have you responded to the call to service? You should if you have studied God’s Word and associated with Jehovah’s witnesses for a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many men and women today have seen the light of God’s Word and, in effect, they have abandoned their nets and have followed him. Peter, Andrew, James and John stayed with Jesus in the full-time ministry because these men loved the truth and saw the great need to do the work Jesus was doing. They had listened with ears anxious to hear when John the Baptist told them to repent and be ready for Messiah’s coming. Now they had come to know the Messiah and believed that he was the one sent by God and was the Son of God. They had traveled with him from time to time, but now at the Sea of Galilee the big opportunity came. The question then was, Would they answer the call as Isaiah did and say: “Here I am! Send me”? They did, and we today are grateful for it because we have their fine example to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus was still looking for sincere men even though these four fishers definitely accepted the call to be his followers. While Jesus was in Capernaum he saw a man “named Levi sitting at the tax office, and he said to him: ‘Be my follower.’ And leaving everything behind he rose up and went following him.” (Luke 5:27, 28) Later Levi (or, Matthew) spread a big reception feast for Jesus, and reclining at the table with him were many other tax collectors. His disciples were there too and Jesus used this opportunity to give a fine witness to all present. He said: “I have come to call, not righteous persons, but sinners to repentance.”—Luke 5:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now, after </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> year and a half of preaching and teaching his disciples and after attending his second passover since his baptism, Jesus selected from his many disciples twelve to be his apostles. He made this matter of selecting men for such an important position a subject of prayer, and Luke tells us: “In the progress of these days he went out into the mountain to pray, and he continued the whole night in prayer to God. But when it became day he called his disciples to him and chose from among them twelve, whom he also named apostles: Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphae'us, and Simon who is called ‘the zealous one,’ and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who turned traitor.”—Luke 6:12-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How interesting all this information is! It took Jesus well over a year and a half to select these twelve men as his apostles. He had gathered many disciples around himself, many followed him, many put faith in him, but out of all of these, after a year and a half of work, he decided on twelve men that he taught, called and prepared for a special work. He did not appoint them to this work of apostleship on his first calling them to follow him, even though they at once left their fishing or tax collecting work. First the implanting of knowledge was necessary!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So it is today. Jehovah’s witnesses find many persons in their house-to-house work who become interested in the message of God’s kingdom. Studies in the Bible are often started and conducted in the homes of the people, sometimes for a year or much longer. A Christian teacher should not be discouraged because some do not make their minds up to walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus in a short period of time, say a year. Consider, if you are an active Christian, how long it took you to make up your mind to go from house to house in the ministry. If you are not an active Christian, ask yourself, ‘Am I a Christian?’ Maybe you are one in name only and, of course, then you do not even deserve the name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the case of the four fishermen, they already had a profession. It was fishing for fish in the Sea of Galilee. They probably were doing a very good business. James and John were working with their father Zebedee and they had hired men. So if they hired men to work along with them they must have had a big thriving business. But despite this fine, lucrative business, the two sons of Zebedee left their father and followed Christ. They wanted to be Christians! (Mark 1:19, 20) The fishing business is a very healthy, out-ofdoors occupation. As for pleasant surroundings, what could be better than the Sea of Galilee? But Jesus had something much better in mind. That is why he told Peter: “From now on you will be catching men alive.” (Luke 5:10) Jesus wanted live men, devoted men, to handle the message he had. They must truly love his Father in heaven, just as he did, and his followers must love one another.—John 13:34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus Christ was starting the Christian work, and these twelve men in their turn must make disciples of Jesus Christ, instructing them in Christ’s teaching. He was opening up the only way of everlasting life for all mankind. At his last Passover celebration, the one he kept with his disciples, and at which time he introduced the Memorial of his death, he said, in his final prayer: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) What a comprehensive statement! To get everlasting life for oneself it is necessary to take in knowledge, and get understanding of the works and purposes of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ. Where can you get such knowledge? In God’s written Word, the Holy Bible. It takes time to read the Bible, but much more time to study it. It even takes more time to be a teacher. That is why these men at once abandoned everything and followed Jesus so as to be his full-time disciples and learn about God and Christ Jesus and so prove to be better teachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now, after he had chosen the twelve apostles, Jesus continued to give them more knowledge of God and to show them the course of life that all men must faithfully follow if they would gain everlasting life. His twelve apostles along with great crowds of people who followed him heard his sermon on the mount, as recorded in the fifth to the seventh chapters of Matthew. This was sound teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAINING AS EVANGELIZERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The apostles always stayed close to Jesus Christ now as learners, taking in knowledge, asking questions, observing the miracles he performed, traveling from city to city with him, always listening with open hearts and minds so as to take in the good news. Jesus knew that the apostles needed special training for their future work and that the best way to give it to them was to send them out on a speaking tour. After their tour, all on their own, and preaching the good news to others, “the apostles gathered together before Jesus and reported to him all the things they had done and taught. And he said to them: ‘Come, you yourselves, privately into a lonely place and rest up a bit.’” (Mark 6:30, 31; Luke 9:10) While Jesus was primarily interested in the twelve apostles and getting them ready to handle the great work that lay ahead of them, still he kept on making disciples of many others and with good success. Continually great crowds of people were coming to him. At one time he spoke to and fed 5,000 people on the northeast side of the Sea of Galilee.—Matt. 14:14-24; Mark 6:30-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By the year 32 C.E., around the time of the festival of tabernacles in Jerusalem, people were truly amazed at this man, Jesus, because, “when by now the festival was half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began teaching. Therefore the Jews fell to wondering, saying: ‘How does this man have a knowledge of letters, when he has not studied at the schools?’ Jesus, in turn, answered them and said: ‘What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me. If anyone desires to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching whether it is from God or I speak of my own originality.’ ” (John 7:14-17) So those people listening had to make decisions either to accept the message as from God or reject it. The same is true today. Some hearers put faith in Jesus’ words and make progress and prepare themselves to preach the same message, namely, “The kingdom of the heavens is at hand.” The least one can do is tell others what one hears about God in one’s daily conversations with other persons. All of us can do that much, can we not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In two years’ time after Jesus began preaching, many more Jews had enough knowledge to go from house to house and preach. Luke tells us: “The Lord designated seventy others and sent them forth by twos in advance of him into every city and place to which he himself was going to come. Then he began to say to them: ‘The harvest, indeed, is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. Go forth. Look! I am sending you forth as lambs in among wolves.’ ” (Luke 10:1-3) His apostles and these seventy disciples, totaling eighty-two teachers, knew that for them to go out into the world and preach as they were now instructed to do would bring upon them many problems, persecution and trials, but they had faith in Jehovah and his Son, Christ Jesus, to take this forward step. These ministers sent to preach still had the time and opportunity of learning more from Jesus. The cry to Pontius Pilate to kill Christ would not be heard until the Passover of the year 33 C.E. By that time, though, there were at least 120 who had full faith in Christ Jesus, and forty days after his resurrection Jesus gave to them through the apostles the orders: “Do not withdraw from Jerusalem, but keep waiting for what the Father has promised, about which you heard from me; because John, indeed, baptized with water, but you will be baptized in holy spirit not many days after this.” (Acts 1:4, 5) Surely they would get further direction as to what they should do now that Jesus had died upon the torture stake and had been resurrected from the dead and had ascended to heaven. These 120 disciples, eleven of the original apostles and 109 other disciples, were awaiting in an upper room in Jerusalem for some sign from Christ Jesus. The sign came! “They all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance.” (Acts 2:4) These now spoke fearlessly about the things they learned in but a few years because they followed Jesus. As for Peter himself, he certainly would be made a fisher of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On that day of Pentecost Peter stood up and raised his voice and spoke to a great crowd of people, thousands. When he finished, 3,000 embraced the word heartily and were baptized. Undoubtedly many of these three thousand had listened to Jesus and had been taught by him. Jesus was well known throughout Jerusalem, Judea, Galilee and all the land of Palestine, for he was a great preacher of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The life Christ led brought results. His preaching produced ministers of God. What has your ministry for God produced? Have you been a good student of the Scriptures and a hearer of the Word and thus equipped yourself to be a good teacher? If you call yourself a Christian, you should be doing what Jesus did or the disciples did. The early Christian congregation showed zeal for God and his kingdom and walked in Jesus’ footsteps. How many men and women of the Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant faiths today believe like Christ Jesus’ followers? How many have ears even to hear? How many preach that the kingdom of God is at hand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In his zeal for the Jews’ religion Saul, a Jewish Pharisee, “breathing threat and murder against the disciples of the Lord,” opposed the work of the Christians. He was stopped by blindness on his way to Damascus by the heavenly resurrected Christ Jesus. Jesus chose this man, the worst persecutor of Christians, to be his follower and be used ‘to bear his name to the nations as well as to kings and the sons of Israel.’ Ananias, a Christian, was sent to the house where Saul was suffering blindness, and at Christ Jesus’ direction he laid his hands on Saul “in order that you [Saul] may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit.” Saul “recovered sight; and he rose and was baptized.” He spent some days with the disciples at Damascus and, when he learned the truth and understood what his work was to be, “immediately in the synagogues he began to preach Jesus, that this One is the Son of God.” He had the spirit of the prophet Isaiah, when he said: “Here I am! Send me.”—Acts 9:1-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once Saul appreciated the truth he started to preach and kept at it. It was not a spasmodic matter with him. One time when he was traveling with his missionary companion Silas, he ordered a demon to come out of a bothersome girl. He caused an uproar and both these Christians were jailed after being beaten. During the night they prayed and praised God with songs, and the prisoners heard them. Then suddenly a great earthquake occurred and the jailer feared that all his prisoners had escaped, but Paul assured him that such was not the case. Then Paul spoke to the jailer on what to do for the jailer to get saved. Here is what happened: “They spoke the word of Jehovah to him together with all those in his house. And he [the jailer] took them along in that hour of the night and bathed their stripes; and, one and all, he and his were baptized without delay.” (Acts 16:32-34) Any circumstance was a good occasion for Paul (the onetime Saul) to speak the word of Jehovah, and he got results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Please observe that the jailer and his family, after hearing the word of Jehovah, “without delay” took their stand for the truth. As far as one’s becoming a Christian is concerned, things are no different today. A person must dedicate himself to the service of Jehovah God as Paul did and as the jailer did; then become baptized and take up Christian activity, if he wants everlasting life. Just as Paul walked in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and as the eleven other apostles chosen by Jesus did, so we must prove ourselves faithful to God’s real worship. We cannot be like Judas Iscariot, who became a betrayer and put material gain first. We, today, must prove ourselves just as faithful as all the early disciples of Christ Jesus in taking up the ministry. This good news of the Kingdom would not have been spread throughout the world today if it had not been for Christians like these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MODERN UNWILLINGNESS TO HEAR GOD’S MESSAGE LEADS TO CALAMITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What an advantage the world of mankind has today with the Word of God printed in many languages and distributed to the ends of the earth! And, in addition, Jehovah’s Christian witnesses of today are anxious and willing to come into the homes of the people of all nations and help them study and understand their own Bibles. But by far those people in Christendom are just like the people in the prophet Isaiah’s day; the more you speak to them about the goodness of God and the gift he gave to mankind in his Son, Christ Jesus, the more they prefer not to understand. Even though they see and hear Jehovah’s witnesses again and again, they refuse to get any knowledge. They do not want to! So, like Isaiah, true Christians preaching the only worthwhile message, “The kingdom of the heavens is at hand,” will “make the heart of this people unre-ceptive, and make their very ears unresponsive, and paste their very eyes together, that they may not see with their eyes and with their ears they may not hear, and that their own heart may not understand and that they may not actually turn back and get healing for themselves.”—Isa. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Jesus was on earth preaching, he said the same thing about the people of his day: “The heart of this people has grown thick.” (Matt. 13:13-15) A few, like the apostles, listened and did something about it, and “they followed him.” The twelve apostles, the seventy evangelizers, and the 120 at Pentecost, and Paul and thousands of other Jews became active Christians in those early days of Christianity. These delighted to do the will of their God Jehovah and walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. But how about the millions upon millions of so-called Christians today? Are their ears and eyes shut?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christendom of this twentieth century says that it is the follower of Christ Jesus, but do you believe it is? Listen to, and read, if you will, about the so-called representatives of Christ Jesus. They certainly do not show the faith in the Word of God that Jesus showed. Today many of the leaders of Christendom want to speak of their own originality and are drawing the greater number of people away from the faith in true Christianity, the faith that Jehovah God lives and faith in God’s Son, Christ Jesus. They try to make the great message that Jesus taught concerning the kingdom of the heavens as of no account. And as for the Bible’s moral code, they would make it as no guide for man today. The Pensacola </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font10"> of Friday, December 3, 1965, reported: “The winds of change sweeping through the Roman Catholic Church are also buffeting the house of Protestantism. Frighteningly for many Protestants, the basic tenets of the Christian faith are being questioned—not by hard-core atheists but by theologians. For want of a better phrase, the new school of Christian humanism has become known as the ‘God is Dead’ movement.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We would like to ask: How can these theologians say that they are Christians, or even represent Christianity? Or, for that matter, how can there be a religion if there is no God or if God is dead? Some theologians think that by the flip of the tongue they can kill God, get rid of him, and wipe out the Bible, God’s Book, where we learn what men have said to God and what God has said to them. Christian men and women with faith in their Creator, God, will not agree with Thomas J. J. Altizer, associate professor of religion at Atlanta’s Emory University, a Methodist-owned school, who says, as also reported in the Pensacola </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font10"> of Friday, December 3, 1965: “We must recognize that the death of God is a historical event.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Such theologians strongly encourage men and women who at one time may have had faith in God and in his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, to discard the Bible and make up their own religion, develop their own belief and do this without a God. They had better call it something other than religion, because Webster’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New International Dictionary</span><span class="font10"> (1927 edition) says concerning religion: “The outward act or form by which men indicate their recognition of the existence of a god, or of gods having power over their destiny, to whom obedience, service and honor are due; the feeling or expression of human love, fear, or awe of some superhuman, overruling power, whether by profession of belief, by observance of rites and ceremonies, or by the conduct of life; a system of faith and worship; a manifestation of piety.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the heading, God, this same dictionary says: “The Supreme Being; the eternal and infinite Spirit, Creator and Sovereign of the universe; Jehovah. ‘God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. (John 4:24).’” It also says: “A being of more than human attributes and powers; especially, a superhuman person, conceived as dominating nature or some province of nature and to whom worship is due and acceptable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These theologians who think they have killed God by teaching their theory should admit they are no longer representing a religion and that they are trying to destroy the worship of all people toward the true God of the universe. They have nothing to worship except themselves, and they surely are no gods. So if there is nothing to worship, there is no religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If anyone is going to practice religion he must believe in God; otherwise it is not a religion. Why not close down all the churches that have ministers who believe God is dead, because they surely do not want their parishioners to believe in God? Maybe their parishioners will turn to ancestor worship or self-worship, or perhaps they are gradually turning their minds over to the Buddhist religion, where people hope eventually to gain nirvana, the great nothing which they believe is God. Webster’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New Collegiate Dictionary</span><span class="font10"> (1961 edition) defines “nirvana”: “The dying out in the heart of passion, hatred, and delusion. This emancipation involves a beatific spiritual condition and freedom from the necessity of future transmigration. Oblivion to care, pain, or external reality.” Are we to believe we came from nothing and go back to nothing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the leading religionists of Christendom are trying to destroy all faith in the Great God of the universe and in his written Word. One example of this is an Associated Press wire of February 13, 1961. It attributes this statement to the auxiliary Episcopal Bishop of California, the “Right Reverend” James A. Pike: “He spoke of the ‘myth of the Garden of Eden,’ which he said has value in explaining what he called the ‘complicated truth’ of the nature of man but added: ‘Yet I do not know a single member of the Anglican Communion—Bishop, Presbyter, Deacon or Layman—who believes this story literally.’ Continuing, in a pastoral letter which he ordered all rectors and vicars of his diocese to read today, he described the virgin birth as a myth which churchmen should be free to accept or reject.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If there was no creation of man and woman in the garden of Eden and the Great God of the universe, Jehovah, had nothing to do with putting man here, then there was no sin to be taken away by the second Adam, Jesus Christ. There was no need of a redeemer and the virgin birth of Jesus Christ. However, the apostle Paul did not agree with or teach this present-day skepticism. He was a great Christian evangelizer, a man of faith who said: “For, indeed, Christ, while we were yet weak, died for ungodly men at the appointed time.” (Rom. 5:6) He knew that mankind needed a redeemer to save them from sin and death. That is why he said: “Just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (Rom. 5:12) But he also preached: “I have hope toward God, which hope these men themselves also entertain, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">15) Do you believe these things? If you do, you will not agree with clergymen who say that they know which parts of the Bible are myth and which are not. If Paul were here today he would say: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.”—Rom. 3:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paul believed there was an Adam who violated God’s law in the garden of Eden, and he knew there was a need for a ransom sacrifice in order to take away the sin of the world, and he believed Christ Jesus was that one who did redeem man. So did all the apostles and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus back there 1,900 years ago. The question is, Do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What do some of your clergymen say? “A rector told the government of the Anglican church of southern England Thursday the Old Testament contains passages of ‘spiritual junk’ and ‘poison’ for the people. Reverend J. C. Wansey of Woodford, near London, called the attention of the Convocation of Canterbury to some of the lessons set down for reading in church for daily use and on Sundays.” (Reported from London by Reuters in the Ottawa </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font10"> of Friday, May 10, 1963.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Buffalo </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Courier Express</span><span class="font10"> of August 13, 1962, had a headline that read: “Minister Cites Need to Censor the Bible.” The article reads, in part: “London (AP). Dr. Leslie Weatherhead, former president of the Methodist Conference, would like to censor the Bible. In an interview with correspondents of three London newspapers, he said he would like to go through the Bible and ‘be very free with a blue pencil. . . . His main target was the Old Testament, which he described as ‘completely outmoded.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The lack of faith in the Bible on the part of the clergy of Christendom is very noticeable. Mike Engleman, editorial staff writer of the Dallas </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Morning News,</span><span class="font10"> expressed himself in his column on Tuesday, May 31, 1966: “Within the United Presbyterian Church is a new organization called the Presbyterian Lay Committee—and behind it lies a fundamental worry of Protestant laymen throughout America: Is the Bible being stressed enough? Is there too much talk from the pulpit these days on social questions and politics, and not enough on the word of God? Declared one prominent Dallas Presbyterian layman recently: ‘Most ministers are so misguided, so completely off base and so full of liberal and humanistic thought that they are proving more worthless to their parishioners each day.’ ” He went on to say in this article: “Modern man today is taking the Bible apart, discarding what it wishes to discard in the Hebrew Scriptures, and in the Greek Scriptures and so they will adjust God’s moral code or law to please themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This statement is so true. Prominent clergymen of Christendom are destroying the people’s belief in the Bible. Is it a myth to you and do you think the Bible’s code for moral conduct is outmoded? Are you gradually being weakened in your faith to a point where you will agree with such men as “Reverend” John W. Wood, a minister of the United Church of Christ, a body formed in the United States by a union of Congregational, Evangelical and Reformed churches, who said: “Homosexual love may reach a sacramental level and thus become as moral as heterosexual behavior. Is it proper for two of the same sex to enter the institution of marriage? This is an important question to which I must reply ‘Yes’ ”? (Toronto </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Star </span><span class="font10">of June 15,1963) Of course, the “Reverend” John W. Wood is in full agreement with the Archbishop of Canterbury in this matter of homosexuality. The Associated Press gives this report from London, with the headline: “Cleric Asks Homosexual Legalization.” “The Archbishop of Canterbury joined other members of the British House of Lords Wednesday in urging the legalization of homosexual practices between adult males.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of course, these clergymen of Christendom think that, if they can stamp the immoral acts of man in the law books as lawful, that will make it moral even though it is contrary to God’s moral law. The apostle Paul would not agree with the Archbishop, because Paul wrote: “What! Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men . . . will inherit God’s kingdom.” (1 Cor. 6:9-11; Rom. 1:24-32; Lev. 18:22) Why do you not follow the advice in God’s Word? It says: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins.”—Rev. 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Associated Press dispatch from Vancouver, B.C., of May 11 informs us: “A bishop of the church of England has said he believes there are circumstances when sexual intercourse outside marriage is not immoral. Such a circumstance could occur with a couple seriously contemplating marriage, the Rt. Rev. Wilfred A. Westall, Bishop of Crediton, Devon, England, told an interviewer. He said he could not condone promiscuity. ‘I don’t think that just because a boy and girl have had premarital intercourse they are unfit for marriage.’ ” Of course, clergymen of Christendom with this view do not agree with the apostle Paul who said: “Neither fornicators . . . nor adulterers . . . will inherit God’s kingdom.” Paul constantly admonished Christians to “flee from fornication.”—1 Cor. 6:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is plenty of evidence to read that shows that the clergy of Christendom are guiding the minds of the people away from the Word of God, the Bible. Here we find the teachings of Christ Jesus, which are the expressions of his Father’s will. Jehovah God the Sovereign Ruler of the universe knows what is the best course for man to follow. He created man and gave him the correct moral code to live by. By their not following God’s Word, look at the delinquent state men are in today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The situation is very similar to that existing in the prophet Isaiah’s day. Isaiah was a vigorous, faithful servant of God. He desired to prove his loyalty to his God when asked: “Whom shall I send?” Isaiah said: “Here I am! Send me.” Jehovah told Isaiah: “Go, and you must say to this people, ‘Hear again and again, O men, but do not understand; and see again and again, but do not get any knowledge.’ ” (Isa. 6:8, 9) Isaiah, by his preaching and continually going to the people, certainly proved to “this people” that they did not want to understand. They did not want to have ears that would listen. The people were too self-centered, too selfish to want to understand. People forced themselves not to hear. They did not want news that disturbed their way of life. So they kept their eyes shut and their ears deaf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same things were true in Jesus’ day. The Jews had become a delinquent nation. They were forgetting their God. John the Baptist tried to get them to repent. Some did, and Christ Jesus opened their hearts and minds to the truth. But it seems that the more he spoke to them about the real life the more people would close their eyes, and they would not hear. When there were loaves and fishes with which to feed them, multitudes followed Jesus; but, finally, even after Pentecost of 33 C.E. only three thousand showed faith in him. Jesus explained to his disciples what was happening due to his talking to the people:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“This is why I speak to them by the use of illustrations, because, looking, they look in vain, and hearing, they hear in vain, neither do they get the sense of it; and toward them the prophecy of Isaiah is having fulfillment, which says, ‘By hearing, you will hear but by no means get the sense of it; and, looking, you will look but by no means see. For the heart of this people has grown thick, and with their ears they have heard with annoyance, and they have shut their eyes; that they might never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and get the sense of it with their hearts and turn back, and I heal them.’ ”—Matt. 13:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What an obstinate people they were with such a fine teacher! But Jesus did not stop preaching, even as Isaiah did not. This prophecy is being fulfilled today, for this same situation exists with Christian witnesses of Jehovah. They still go from house to house, city to city, country to country declaring the good news of God’s kingdom, but not too many people have an ear to hear. Even so, Jehovah’s witnesses will do what Jesus said, preach the good news of the kingdom “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matt. 24:14) A few people out of billions living are thirsting for truth and righteousness and are listening to the Word of God, and they believe. But the vast majority of mankind feel that this calling by Jehovah’s witnesses at their doors regularly is not worthy of their time, and they ‘hear with annoyance.’ The more Jehovah’s witnesses speak to them concerning the Word of God, doing this in all sincerity, the less the people want to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“HOW LONG?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses have asked God in prayer: ‘How long must this unresponsive condition of the people toward the message of God’s kingdom continue on, for they do not have ears to hear and their hearts have grown thick?’ But they always get the same answer from God, namely, that the people will refuse to hear and soften their hearts till calamity comes, ‘until the cities crash in ruin and the houses have no inhabitants.’ So Jehovah’s witnesses keep right on calling despite the unresponsive ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many, in fact, most, of the clergy, the priests, the bishops of Protestant, Greek Orthodox and Catholic religions, which make up Christendom, along with all the other so-called Christian organizations, have taken a definite stand against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses because they are so zealous in preaching God’s kingdom as the only hope for mankind. Listen to what Greece’s Orthodox Primate, Archbishop Chrysostomos, has to say about Jehovah’s witnesses: “The Greek Orthodox Church regard the members of this heresy as enemy No. 1. . . . We have repeatedly appealed to the authorities to intervene and prosecute or arrest those of them who engage in proselytism.” (New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> Monday, August 22, 1966) Talk of this kind by the leading clergymen, along with talk that God is dead and the Bible is a myth by the different divisions of Christendom, shows that they are trying to kill the preaching of true Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Where do you readers stand? Will you listen to what the Christian witnesses of Jehovah have to say or will you make your ears unresponsive and paste your eyes together so you cannot see and your heart cannot understand the Bible? Just what kind of a Christian or person are you? Are most of you so self-satisfied with conditions in this world that you have no time to study God’s Word so as to hear what God has to say about present conditions and the future? Paul found an indifferent attitude like that in this day. He tried diligently to preach the good news to all sorts of people, but it seems the more that he did the more people would not listen. That is why Paul said to Jewish unbelievers: “The holy spirit aptly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers, saying, ‘Go to this people and say: “By hearing, you will hear but by no means understand; and, looking, you will look but by no means see. For the heart of this people has grown un-receptive, and with their ears they have heard without response, and they have shut their eyes; that they should never see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back, and I should heal them.” ’ ” —Acts 28:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Is that the way most of the people want to be, not healed? Or do you want to know God’s will, be healed and gain life everlasting? If so, study your Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The terrible situation existing in Christendom today is due to the clergy. They are responsible because they have turned the hearts and minds of their parishioners away from the true teaching of Jehovah God the Creator of man. Many religionists no longer believe in the need of the Redeemer, Jesus Christ, and now they are trying to make people believe that God is dead. Furthermore, they are trying to remove the fine high standard of morality set out in the Bible and make the Bible of no account. Is it any wonder, then, as Jehovah’s witnesses go from house to house, that they are having a hard time trying to establish the peoples’ faith in the Bible again? The majority of people today do not want to see the light of God’s message; so the people are plastering their eyes shut, and with their ears they no longer hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What are Jehovah’s witnesses going to do about it? Quit? Slow down? Not at all! Their eyes are not pasted shut and they have heard the call, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.” From 1919 C.E. till now over a million of Jehovah’s witnesses have responded, and “they followed him.” It is very important that Jehovah’s witnesses continue to declare this good news of God’s kingdom, because, when the full end of this system of things comes, “this people” who do not hear will have put themselves in such a definite position against God that “they may not hear, and that their own heart may not understand and that they may not actually turn back and get healing for themselves.” (Isa. 6:10) They do not want to be healed, even if healing were offered to them on a golden platter. Christendom has hardened its heart against God. People want this world, and they think they can preserve it by loving and showing affection for the United Nations organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The clergy of Christendom are helping to gather the kings of the entire inhabited earth together to the “war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (Rev. 16:14) The Devil, who is “the god of this system of things,” along with his demons will see to it that mankind in the great majority will line itself up on the side of the unholy organizations of the world and that he has gathered them together “to the place that is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.” (Rev. 16:16) Surely those who refuse to hear the message of God’s kingdom and put faith in Jehovah God and his Word now are hardening their hearts so much that they will not be able to turn back, but will be completely destroyed when “the cities actually crash in ruins, to be without an inhabitant.” (Isa. 6:11) Why not break away from Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, and study God’s written Word?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The religious leaders of Christendom seldom agree among themselves as to how the wonderful message of Christ is to be presented to the people of Christendom. Even high-ranking church officials admit that evangelistic methods employed by some are not having much success. The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> of Wednesday, September 28, 1966, made this report: “Billy Graham Evangelism Deplored by Canterbury, Vancouver B.C., Sept. 27 (AP)—The Rev. Dr. Michael Ramsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday that the Christian church needs some updating, but not the type practiced by the Rev. Billy Graham. ‘The recent Graham crusade in England won some converts, yet it made no significant changes in basic English religious habits,’ Dr. Ramsey said after stepping off a plane from Kamloops. ‘The Billy Graham type of evangelism is not the kind we need in these trying times. We need an intellectual, thoughtful approach—not bursts of emotionalism.’ Asked if the church is out of date, the Archbishop replied: ‘Not generally speaking. I have seen that in both Canada and England there are aspects that are antiquated, others that are virile and growing. In many cases, there is less conventional church-going yet stronger convictions among those who do go.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font10"> is good to hear that the Archbishop admits that these are “trying times” in which we live. But he also points out that his fellow workers are not doing much to help the situation with their “bursts of emotionalism.” It is interesting to note that he says Billy Graham won ‘some converts, but made no significant change in basic English religious habits.’ The Archbishop’s observations of England and Canada are that there are ‘aspects in the church that are antiquated.’ This is undoubtedly true. Their doctrines and theories are based on creeds brought over from heathen religions that existed from even before the time of Christ. If the updating of religion is what other clergymen are doing by calling many parts of the Bible a myth and by saying that we must accommodate the present generation, then the Bible standard is no longer satisfactory to such clergymen. With such thinking, is there any wonder that most people are no longer going to church? Why should there be churchgoing when all one gets there are men’s theories, such as God</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">is dead, the ransom sacrifice of Jesus is of no value and the Bible is not the Word of God? This is the time for peoples of all nations to wake up, tear away from false teachers and listen to the message of Christ Jesus and his true Christian witnesses of Jehovah who believe the Word of God and are happy to spend time teaching God’s Word to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPOND TO THE CALL,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you still have a love for God and believe he lives and have a desire to know the truth as set out in his written Word, then study it. Remember, Jesus taught his apostles for some time before “they followed him.” But when they learned they responded. Christ Jesus then made them “fishers of men.” Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to arrange home Bible studies with anyone who is seeking the truth from God’s Word. If you are not already studying with one of Jehovah’s witnesses or attending the Kingdom Hall meetings with Jehovah’s witnesses, then for your own good get in touch with them. If you cannot find someone to teach you, write to the Watch Tower Society, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York, and we will arrange for someone to conduct a Bible study with you in your own home. Now is the time to learn about God and his will concerning you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses know the call was not to follow Jesus in his ministry for a short duration. Yet, they feel like Isaiah, who said: “Here I am! Send me.” He was not sent for a short period of time, but had to keep preaching for the rest of his life despite the unresponsiveness of his own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How long do Jehovah’s witnesses think they must serve Jehovah God so as to gain life everlasting? Is it for just a few years of their lives? No! They want to serve like the apostles and the early Christians who followed Christ Jesus, and that meant being faithful until death. They want to work and continue to “catch men” and gather them together into God’s congregation so they, too, can follow Christ Jesus and bring eternal praise and honor to the Creator of man, Jehovah God. No finer work than being a minister of God has ever been offered to any human creature. Seize it! Do not be like the man to whom Jesus said: “Be my follower.” The man said: “Permit me first to leave and bury my father.” But he said to him: “Let the dead bury their dead, but you go away and declare abroad the kingdom of God.” And still another said: “I will follow you, Lord; but first permit me to say good-by to those in my household.” Jesus said to him: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.” After these things “the Lord designated seventy others and sent them forth by twos in advance of him into every city and place to which he himself was going to come. Then he began to say to them: ‘The harvest, indeed, is great, but the workers are few. Therefore beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. Go forth. Look! I am sending you forth as lambs in among wolves.’ ” (Luke 9:59-62; 10:1-3) Would you not rejoice to be like the seventy others who followed him and were sent by the Master of the harvest? You still have time to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REPORT OF THOSE SENT TO HARVEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It may be we are getting near the end of the harvest years, but while there is yet time we should all work zealously. Jehovah’s witnesses around the world have worked diligently during the 1966 service year. They spent millions of hours trying to make disciples of men and women of all nations, peoples and tongues, and with good success. Those who studied the truth in home Bible studies </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font10"> a period of time, even several years, and who finally appreciated the wonderful work that Jehovah wants done in the earth in these “last days” have expressed their willingness to share in the work Jehovah’s witnesses are doing. They have declared themselves publicly as wanting to be harvesters, working under the Master, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the 199 lands where Jehovah’s witnesses have been preaching during the past service year, 58,904 individuals have dedicated their lives to the doing of Jehovah’s will and symbolized this dedication by water immersion. It is true, there were 5,489 fewer individuals who dedicated their lives to Jehovah in 1966 than the year before, but when one stops to think that 58,904 persons made the big step in their lives, it is marvelous. From now on they, too, will be ministers going from house to house preaching that the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near, just as Jesus did. They will also be giving the warning concerning the destruction of this devilish world and of the incoming new order of things under Christ Jesus. What an opportunity is theirs of now teaching the truth to others concerning everlasting life gained through the merits of Christ’s sacrifice! These new Christian ministers have now joined the many other harvesters so that the last great gathering of people who are seeking meekness and righteousness might take place. Remember, Noah gathered his family into the ark, and they were saved. Do you want to be saved?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Were you one of the more than a million Christian witnesses of Jehovah who devoted his time and energies to the preaching of this good news? How many of the 170,664,897 hours devoted to preaching last year did you devote to the spreading of the good news by going from house to house and conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people? Or, were you one of those who, after putting his hand to the plow, ‘looked back at the things behind’? Or, did you find some excuse for not being one of Jesus’ disciples? It is evident from the year’s report that a number of persons who used to be Jehovah’s witnesses found reasons sufficient to convince themselves that they need no longer worship and serve Jehovah and attend meetings at the house of their God. Such ones drifted away. However, there is still an opportunity before one dies to ask for forgiveness and share in God’s goodness by returning to the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If all those who dedicated their lives to the Most High God Jehovah in former years had stayed in his organization right up to and during the year 1966, there would have been a greater increase in the number of regular publishers than we have had. While the final report shows there were 1,058,675 regular Kingdom publishers engaging in the field ministry each month of the past service year, still this is an increase of only 24,407 over last year. But 58,904 were baptized. Where were the other 34,497 that cannot be accounted for? Allowing for one percent of the population dying in a year’s time would mean a drop of about 10,000 persons. But where are the others? Has materialism attracted them? Has the loose living and immoral conduct of the world ensnared some of them? Where is that love for Jehovah’s organization and his service that they once had?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As we analyze the report for the world, as set forth in the chart on pages 36-43, you will see that some countries had no increase at all. Are we to believe that the harvest is over in such countries? No! Because there were some persons being baptized. Even if that baptism were not the case, Jehovah’s witnesses cannot stop preaching, because Christ Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited</span></p>

Check the report on Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Congo (Kinshasa), Dominican Republic, Japan, Nicaragua, Portugal, Puerto Rico and Spain. Even some of the countries behind the Iron Curtain had 3-or 4-percent increases. Of course, we have not published the figures of how many publishers are in these nations, due to the heavy hand of persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses there.

<p><span class="font10">to as many persons as they possibly can and with good success. In fact, people are so interested in their message that it was necessary for 60,902,000 back-calls, or return visits, to be made to help those who wanted to know more about the Bible. There were 802,473 regular Bible studies conducted in the homes of the people each week. This means that there were over 31,000 more Bible studies conducted in 1966 than during the previous year. What are Jehovah’s witnesses going to do with all the people attending these 802,473 Bible studies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We do well to ask ourselves this question: ‘If we are conducting a home Bible study, with what kind of material are we building?’ In teaching the truth to these people, are we building with good solid materials, like gold, silver and precious stones? Or, are we, rather, careless, indifferent, in our teaching and are we using building materials like wood, hay or stubble? A good Christian will not build with combustible materials because then his works would go up in smoke in the day of fiery trials. Paul said: “The day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire; and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one’s is.” (1 Cor. 3:12, 13) It would be most disappointing to a harvester to see his ingathered crop going up in smoke. What kind of builder are you? Do you try to produce real Christians?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s Christian witnesses certainly want to present the truth clearly when conducting their Bible studies and show the people the responsibility that goes with being a Christian, so that, when they do dedicate their lives to God and symbolize it by water baptism, they will continue in the truth, firm to the very end. What joy this brings to faithful followers of Christ Jesus!</span></p>

So, while the distribution of bound books increased by more than 900,000 copies, the new subscriptions obtained for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> dropped by about 140,000. However, by the end of the service year the Society found it necessary to print more copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines than during the previous year. The total production amounted to 230,175,323 magazines, of which 118,770,627 were copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and 111,404,696 were copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s Christian witnesses had a very delightful year in spite of the fact that it was more difficult to convince people to take a definite stand on the side of Jehovah’s kingdom and enter into the ministry. In many lands, like Cuba, Spain, Portugal and especially countries behind the Iron Curtain, the Witnesses had to put up with much persecution and harassment, but they are thankful for their opportunity to serve Jehovah God. In Burma all the missionaries were ordered to leave the country. But none of these happenings discouraged God’s servants. They have continued to press on with joy in all these lands. But it is more and more difficult to find people with ears to hear and eyes to see and with hearts that can be turned back to Jehovah. The time of decision is here and it appears that a definite decision is being made by the majority of the people world wide. Even though they have ears with which to hear, they will not do so, and though they have eyes with which to see, they refuse to see, because they do not want their own hearts to understand, and they do not want actually to turn back and get healing for themselves from Jehovah. But even though this be the attitude of mind of the majority of people who make up the many nations, tribes and tongues of the world, Jehovah’s witnesses have the responsibility of going forth as God’s workers into the harvest. They remember Jesus’ words: “Look! I am sending you forth as lambs in among wolves.” (Luke 10:3) They do not flinch and turn back. It is their prayer that during the 1967 service year they will find more persons who want to know what Jehovah’s will is concerning them and who will want to get out of this wicked system of things. Millions of people know that the situation cannot continue to exist as it is, for, if it goes on this way, mankind will destroy itself. The witnesses of Jehovah want to aid all those they can to know what the Bible has to say on the vital subjects of life and death in order to help men to choose life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those of you who have read this report and who want to know what the Bible says about our times should feel free to write to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in your own country and ask that one of Jehovah’s witnesses be sent to talk to you about God’s Word. Or, if you know where Jehovah’s witnesses meet in your city or village, why not get acquainted with them and study the Bible? Throughout the world there are 24,910 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. The work being done by them in all the earth today is similar to the work that was carried on by Jesus. Jesus went about the land teaching and preaching the truth and he found disciples who wanted to learn the truth. In those days, too, many people believed what they heard but did nothing about it. What will you do? Will you investigate? The time must come in each one’s life for him to make a decision, especially after reading and studying the Holy Scriptures. When you hear the call, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men,” what will your answer be? All of Jehovah’s baptized witnesses have made this decision; they want to be fishers of men, and they will be if ‘they follow him.’ —Matt. 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“GOD’S SONS OF LIBERTY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DISTRICT ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1964 it was decided by the Society that Canada would be given special attention in 1966 by our arranging for a series of conventions from coast to coast. So for two years preparation was made for big Canadian assemblies, and Jehovah’s witnesses were informed so that if they desired they could visit Canada during the summer of 1966. People from all parts of the United States showed they were happy that Canada was chosen as one of the principal countries in which to have international assemblies. Jehovah’s witnesses came by the thousands! There was no one place large enough and centrally located in Canada that could accommodate all of Jehovah’s witnesses who wanted to come, so a series of conventions was scheduled. The first one was in Toronto, Ontario, June 22-26. The next week the convention was in Corner Brook, Newfoundland. From there, during following weeks, conventions were held in Halifax, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver. All these conventions were similar in the program arrangements, but each one stood out by itself in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Exhibition grounds in Toronto were chosen as the place for the first assembly, and the news of the fine program, which began on Wednesday and continued through Sunday, certainly spread fast. Instead of the first assembly in Toronto being the most outstanding one, it seemed as though the momentum caused by the enthusiasm built up at Toronto grew throughout the entire summer and reached a grand peak by the time the assemblies were coming to a close in Canada, the United States and other parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TORONTO</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Everything that happens at a convention happened in Toronto first this year, and the opening day saw 27,000 in attendance. The theme of the whole program was that of liberty, freedom, and that God’s sons have this so as to carry on the great work of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom no matter where they may be on earth. The chairman in his opening address pointed out that everyone present should be a good listener and be in his seat because a lot of things would happen during the assembly. This proved to be true, and no one was disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All the discourses by the many speakers on the program were full of good spiritual food and very appreciatively received. On Wednesday evening when everyone was paying attention to the portion of the program entitled “Listen to Daniel’s Words for Our Day,” they were thrilled at hearing different voices come over the loudspeaker representing Daniel, the three Hebrew children and even the angels, with the sound of music when the three Hebrews were commanded along with others to bow to the image of gold set up by the king on the plains of Dura. Something new was happening!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the close of the program on the first night all present felt real satisfaction. Everyone was keyed up for the next day’s program, which was also filled with good spiritual food. The keynote speech was entitled “Building on a Right Foundation with Fire-Resistant Materials.” The question was put squarely before all those who have dedicated their lives to God: As God’s fellow workers and with God’s help, just what sort of persons are we making out of people with whom we talk? It was emphatically shown that our work is to make disciples of Christ out of people. We are to make Christians in the true sense. As ministers of God our responsibility is to be sure that the people to whom we witness and with whom we have Bible studies and whom we invite to our Kingdom Halls turn out to be real Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We must build on the precious foundation that Jehovah God has laid in heavenly Zion, namely, Jesus Christ. The president of the Society showed that our desire was to produce real Christians. Otherwise our work of building would be wasted. He asked the question: ‘Will the sort of Christians we build withstand the day of fire?’ It all depends on what we build into the Christians that we are making. We must build with fire-resistant materials, noninflammable materials, he pointed out. Certainly when the fiery tests come upon all Christians around this whole earth, every lover of true Christianity will desire to come through that fire with tested Christian qualities to the glory of God, the Great Builder, whose fellow workers we are. His talk gave everyone a lot to think about and to reflect on as to what the outcome will be among those to whom they have talked about living Christian lives. Would the students with whom they study stand the fiery test? And how about the Christians they had already made?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A large crowd of 31,800 were back that evening wondering what the program meant when it said: “See Jeremiah’s Endurance, Needed in Our Day.” They soon saw what was meant! Something was happening now on the platform in that great stadium, with people watching from both sides of the stadium, that Jehovah’s witnesses had never seen before—a real, live drama with the people in costumes, reproducing the life of Jeremiah and his activities in Jerusalem. It was happening there before their very eyes. But not only that, the experiences of Jeremiah were being applied to our day, and we were asked, Will we have the endurance, the strength to maintain integrity? Will we have the fire-resistant material necessary to go through persecution and trials similar to those that Jeremiah experienced? The second day of the convention certainly had everyone thinking and expressing appreciation to Jehovah God for the marvelous truths that were being presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The next day those in attendance heard a fine talk by the vice-president of the Society. The title of his talk was “Making Grateful Use of a Penny.” The brothers appreciated that the symbolic “penny” was not the gift of the holy spirit in itself, but it was the privilege that went with the receiving of the holy spirit, namely, the privilege of being a member of spiritual Israel, authorized to prophesy in fulfillment of Joel 2:28, 29. God's servants in the earth were anointed to preach the good news of God’s Messianic kingdom, and every one must be a fruit-bearing branch in Jehovah’s spiritual vine, the Lord Jesus Christ. Truly, those of the anointed remnant of the Kingdom heirs, including those that Jehovah God added since 1919, are grateful for the “penny” paid to them. They put it to good use, and the speaker said: “Particularly since the year 1935 the penny has been used in gathering the great crowd of sheeplike persons together as foretold in Revelation 7:9-17.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But just before this very fine lecture there was another drama presented on the platform entitled “Look to the Bible as Our Guide in Life.” This really put into application everything that had been said by the many speakers in the previous days, and showed the audience by acting on the stage just what a person had to do in life and the course of action he had to take if he did not want to get entangled in the affairs of this world and wanted to make straight paths for his feet. It was another real, true-to-life drama, taking the actual happenings as recorded in the Bible and acting them out and then applying them to our day. Now there were 33,594 present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The whole program that followed, including the new release, a bound book entitled “Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God,” certainly presented clearly to all who have dedicated their lives to God how they have been freed. Now they, in turn, must preach a release to the captives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The new book was enthusiastically received in Toronto, both the regular and the pocket edition. By evening time excitement was running high because of comments in the book about 1975 being the end of six thousand years of human history. That evening the vice-president spoke on “Liberty-giving Worship and Freedom of Worship” and showed how even our brothers in Portugal who had been arrested for preaching the good news of God’s kingdom were still free, liberated people, and he said: “Although they may not everywhere enjoy freedom of worship, still Jehovah’s Christian witnesses are a liberated people. They strive to keep the liberty that their practice of the pure worship gives to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The convention reached its climax on Sunday afternoon at three o’clock when Brother Knorr spoke on the subject “What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?” at which time 46,118 were in attendance. The audience was thoroughly convinced that God’s kingdom has been doing a lot since 1914 and that those serving the interests of the Kingdom will keep on doing a lot more until this good news is preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then the end will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the president’s closing remarks on Sunday evening he gave more information about what happened in Portugal and told that there were 2,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses who crowded around the courtroom at the time of the trial of the forty-nine witnesses of Jehovah who had been arrested. What a witness to all of Lisbon and the Portuguese government that Jehovah’s witnesses are standing 100 percent behind their freedomloving brothers! In fact, the day the brothers spent there at the courtroom, in the patio and along the walks outside the court building, was a great uplift to them. Some of them said: “Now we have had our first large assembly in Portugal.” While forty-nine of Jehovah’s witnesses had been arrested, this in no way slowed down the work of preaching the good news in Portugal by God’s sons of liberty, because 3,292 publishers were going out in the field preaching the good news of God’s kingdom even though they knew that forty-nine had been arrested just for meeting together. What fearlessness they showed in behalf of their brothers, and what devotion to God’s kingdom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The urgency of our times was emphasized by the president too, because now is a time that God’s people must be diligent. Things are happening world wide, all of which point to the ominous destruction of this system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Outstanding in Toronto was the publicity given the convention. This was the biggest thing that ever came to the city as far as conventions are concerned. The Canadian Broadcasting Company put on a chain program from coast to coast the following week, and this certainly aroused the interest of the people in Newfoundland in the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses that was to be held in Corner Brook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The convention program presented at Toronto was repeated at Corner Brook. This was a small convention of only 1,284, but five days long. There were new speakers and new actors in the dramas. Brother Knorr also attended this assembly and gave the same talks as in Toronto, with a few additional ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From one end of the country to another, from Halifax, to Montreal, to Winnipeg and to Vancouver, the radio stations, newspapers and other publicity outlets were interested in this grand series of conventions because it was so big for Canada. In the six assemblies from Newfoundland across the country to Vancouver there were 118,314 in attendance at the public meetings and 1,429 were baptized in symbol of their dedication to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses gave excellent support to the assembly in Montreal. Fifteen years ago Jehovah’s witnesses were not very welcome in Montreal, but things have changed because of the fight for freedom that Jehovah’s witnesses undertook, freedom to preach the good news to the people of Quebec. They won their cases in court, and now the whole atmosphere of Quebec is changed toward Jehovah’s witnesses, and their convention was most welcome in the city of Montreal. In fact, two conventions were held there simultaneously, one in the French language and another in the English language. At the Marche Atwater in Montreal there were 2,737 who attended the public meeting given in French by Brother Saumur, while Brother Knorr spoke at the Forum, which was packed out with 16,550 persons. It was indeed good to see the fine spirit shown toward Jehovah’s witnesses by the citizenry of all these cities in which Jehovah’s witnesses held their conventions this year in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All who had the privilege of attending the assemblies in Canada rejoiced that they had this opportunity of going to this northern country of North America to share in proclaiming the good news of God’s kingdom as well as to attend these glorious assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, in the United States assemblies were held also with similar programs. The overall attendance for the United States during the past summer at the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies was 203,619, with 2,906 baptized. For the North American assemblies during this summer of 1966 there was a total attendance of 321,933 at the public meeting and 4,335 were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are a few other things that should be said about all these assemblies in North America, which were also duplicated in Europe during the summer. For one thing, the brothers enjoyed receiving a copy of the public meeting lecture, which was put in booklet form and was distributed after the public talks. They were delighted with the new book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God,</span><span class="font9"> and it was necessary for the factory in Brooklyn to produce over 1,100,000 copies of the regular edition and 250,000 copies of the pocket edition for the assemblies in North America. Another thing that brought great pleasure to the brothers was the use of the new songbook, the publication called “Singing and Accompanying Yourselves with Music in Your Hearts.” The songbook had been released some months before the convention so that the congregations could practice the new songs, and it certainly was a pleasure to hear the brothers sing at the various assemblies and to see how much they enjoyed the new melodies and words, which they could sing with feeling from their hearts. By the end of August more than 290,000 copies of the deluxe edition of this new songbook had been shipped out and 545,000 copies of the regular edition. So you can see how much the brothers enjoyed this new songbook. With the new records that the Society has also produced, which carry the music of the songs, our brothers in the English-speaking world right now are enjoying these new songs. Eventually they will be enjoyed in other languages as the new songbook is translated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So with songs in their hearts God’s sons of liberty left the assemblies with the feeling that it was well worth their while to have been there. They had learned much and they went away with rejoicing, determined to help one another as brothers in Jehovah’s organization and to continue preaching the good news of God’s kingdom everywhere until Jehovah says it is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES ARE MINISTERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are more than 900,000,000 people in the world today that claim to be Christians, but this, most people will admit, is in name only. A true Christian is one who walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and who does the will of his Father in heaven. An individual who becomes one of Jehovah’s witnesses must first dedicate his life to the doing of Jehovah’s will. He has expressed to God in prayer that he will do that will of God as God has revealed it to him in his written Word. The apostle Paul in writing to the Hebrews concerning Jesus said: “Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘ “Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offering.” Then I said, “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.”’” (Heb. 10:5-7; Ps. 40:7, 8) Jesus Christ was the Son of God and Jesus knew “it is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Luke 4:8) One who walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus would have to find out what the will of God is concerning him, and, of course, it is the same for every person who declares himself to be a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus’ instruction to all his faithful followers was: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Real Christians, which the disciples of Christ were, had this commission, and so everyone that takes up the work of Jesus, that of making disciples, has to bring to these the truth of God’s Word and then bring them to the point of dedication and baptism. When they are baptized they should come to a full understanding of all the commandments that Jesus set forth. Of course, one of the most prominent commandments in the Bible is set forth in Matthew 24:14, which says: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” This means that every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, those walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, having dedicated himself to the doing of God’s will, will have to be a minister declaring this good news. This becomes his whole purpose in life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even though individuals are engaged in secular work, working on farms, in factories, and offices, in order to earn sufficient money to take the proper care of their families, they do all this as to Jehovah. (Col. 3:23) They are doing these things in addition to their ministry to provide the necessary things in life and to obtain food, clothing and shelter for those for whom they are responsible. At the same time they arrange their affairs to attend mettings regularly with Jehovah’s witnesses and share in the house-to-house ministry, as did Jesus and the apostles, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Really, uppermost in the minds of any minister of God, or one of Jehovah’s witnesses, is the doing of Jehovah’s will, spreading this good news of God’s kingdom, instructing people in Bible study. One who becomes an ordained minister of God through the study of God’s Word, dedication and water baptism, that is, complete immersion in water, feels his individual responsibility. Such one is not the kind that shrinks back from the work that has been assigned to him, but he is the kind of person that has faith to the preserving alive of the soul.—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A person who knows one of Jehovah’s witnesses and who knows that such person claims to be doing the will of God should find in that one that he is very interested in teaching others what the Bible has to say about life and how to attain to everlasting life through the arrangements that God has made through his Son Christ Jesus. A Christian witness of Jehovah God, who is an ordained minister, feels just like the apostle Paul, who wrote the Galatians: “So let us not give up in doing what is fine, for in due season we shall reap if we do not tire out. Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:9, 10) Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, then, would be interested in attending meetings in the Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s witnesses wherever he resides in the world, and today there are 24,910 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses earth wide, in 199 nations, provinces, colonies and islands of the sea, where these Christian people come together to study regularly in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The worldwide work of Jehovah’s witnesses is directed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, a religious corporation, which has a membership of between 400 and 500, all Christian witnesses of Jehovah and ordained ministers who are very much interested in spreading this good news of the Kingdom world wide. Yearly these members come together and have an annual meeting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, either in person or by proxy, and they elect directors that will look after the ministerial activity of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world. These directors, then, elect officers who are responsible for the general direction of the work done by the branch offices in ninety-five cities around the world. The Society appoints branch servants who manage the work in different countries. It also appoints all the district servants and circuit servants who regularly visit the congregations of God’s people throughout the world. Through this organization, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Jehovah’s witnesses keep a close bond of union in love, being interested in but one thing, helping people to get a better understanding of the Bible so they will come to know Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The overseer who is branch servant in the various countries has the responsibility of appointing congregation servants who act as presiding ministers for the other ministers in the congregations. The branch servant also appoints assistants to that one to take care of the many details that are involved in a smoothrunning congregation of God in the various cities and towns of the world. Additionally, the branch servant appoints special pioneers and pioneers who generally work in isolated territory that quite often is not held by congregations, but that we feel should be covered in the witnessing activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. Special effort is made by the Society to reach all the peoples of the earth with the Bible and its good message, if at all possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That, generally, is the overall picture of how Jehovah’s witnesses operate around the world. They are all ordained ministers, all are Christians, dedicated to the doing of Jehovah’s will, and have been baptized in water. This signifies that they believe God’s will concerning them is expressed in his written Word, and henceforth they do that will to the very best of their ability and to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania has other Bible societies with which they work in full accord. There are the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., the International Bible Students Association, established in England, and other Bible societies in other countries of Europe, South America and elsewhere throughout the earth. These corporations, religious societies, are all used by Jehovah’s witnesses to direct the affairs of God’s people in these various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The headquarters for Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide is located in Brooklyn, New York, where the main offices of Jehovah’s witnesses are. It is at this place that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines and various books and other printed matter are composed and Bible translations are prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is very much interested in each individual who claims to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, or who is interested in the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses, and therefore </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> Society arranges to give them special education and training, as in the Theocratic Ministry School conducted in each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses world wide. This school is conducted by a competent minister who aids others to grow in their ability to present the Word of God. There are other schools that the Society operates for the benefit of overseers, such as the Kingdom Ministry School and the Gilead School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM MINISTRY SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Kingdom Ministry School was organized about eight years ago for the purpose of helping the overseers in the congregation to get a clearer understanding of the Word of God and to appreciate better their ministerial service as it affects other members of the congregation. This school is in operation in many countries of the world and is supervised by the branch servant. Instructions are given by ministers appointed by the president of the Society, and the period of study, a refresher course, for each group of ministers, lasts for two weeks. The overseers, assistant overseers and the Bible study servants in all congregations will eventually be invited to come to this Kingdom Ministry School for the two-week training period, which will certainly help them in dealing with problems in the local congregations and in setting the proper example for all Christians to follow in their ministerial activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the United States the Kingdom Ministry School is located at South Lansing, New York, at the present time; and during the past service year 1,012 individuals went through this school. In the seven and a half years that it has been in operation in the United States, 6,481 have enjoyed and benefited by the instruction in the school. This school also operates in countries such as Canada, England, Germany, in fact, throughout the whole world. The same course is taught in the local languages so that everyone will see in harmony as to God’s will and the work that must be done in these “last days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE SCHOOL OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The missionary students that have graduated from this school certainly have helped greatly in carrying the good news of God’s kingdom to the ends of the earth. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, which operates this school and sends missionaries to all parts of the world, appreciates that so many young people have volunteered their services and have come forward to say: “Here I am! Send me.” The Society has sent them to many lands, and as you read this </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> you will see how the work has expanded in the different parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While time runs out for this old system of things as events shape up for Armageddon, the projects and institutions of the world slow down, falter and crumble. But it is no time to slack down or “taper off” for Jehovah’s witnesses. There is more urgency than ever. The New World society will expand and increase with greater and greater energy until God says, “It is enough.” All of Jehovah’s witnesses need more education, need to keep making their minds over in line with the deeper truths revealed. In obedience to the heavenly command, “Let the righteous one do righteousness still, and let the holy one be made holy still,” they must keep on and at last have an accumulated credit with God and be richly rewarded. (Rev. 22:11) Therefore, the pace of the educational work must be stepped up for Jehovah’s people and must be directed more effectively toward those who are sighing and groaning over all the detestable things they see being done in the world, and who must hear and obey the everlasting good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For this reason the call is for more missionaries, more who will, as did Abraham, leave their own homes and countries and go to lands that God designates. Jehovah has blessed Gilead School and the missionaries sent forth from it. Accordingly, during the 1966 service year, the school was happy to graduate 211 more to meet the need in the field. These 211 comprised the fortieth and forty-first classes. To date, since the school’s establishment in 1943, 4,255 have graduated and have been sent into more than 140 lands in the various continents and many islands of the sea. Many have made these assignments their home now for ten, fifteen or twenty years and hope to stay with their “children,” the many sheeplike ones they have taught and trained in the ministry, right through the battle of Armageddon into God’s new order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The length of the fortieth class term was shortened from ten months to eight, with a view to the five-month terms to follow. It was the last class to receive special emphasis on organizational training, such as branch office management. The need is so great for missionaries, and the field is so ripe for the harvest, that the more academic feature of education was de-emphasized. The shorter period of five months concentrated more strongly on the Bible and the preaching work, equipping the missionaries to strengthen people’s faith in God and his Word of truth, which Christendom’s clergy are tearing down among their church membership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Graduation of the fortieth class, which represented thirty-one countries, was on Monday afternoon, September 13, 1965, in the Kingdom Hall in the Brooklyn Bethel home. After comments to the 108 graduating missionaries by the instructors and the Bethel home and factory servants, F. W. Franz, the Society’s vicepresident, addressed the audience of 743 on maintaining and inculcating in others the right spirit, the spirit of Christ, in the face of the spirit of rebellion that is spreading throughout the earth today and is especially evident in the world’s institutions of higher learning. Brother Knorr then spoke on the need to express love in a loveless world, calling attention to the examples of Jehovah and Jesus Christ as models to follow. Then, as each student stepped up and walked across the stage, his foreign assignment was announced. In all, this class was being sent to forty-three lands. A fine sentiment expressed in the class resolution read next by one of the graduates was that “we have had others that have been our teachers apart from the school, and that is the 700 members of the Bethel family that we have come to know and love. In the years ahead when we think of the world headquarters of Jehovah’s organization we will have a picture of faithfulness, endurance and unselfishness of humble brothers who are willing to be led by God’s spirit to do his will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the evening, after a special meal for the students and Bethel family, came the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study in which the graduating students handled the comments. Then a relaxing program of music, interspersed by encouraging expressions from the students, concluded a full and upbuilding day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Already some of the students from other countries who needed English-language instruction had come in, so as to be ready for the forty-first class. And by Wednesday, October 6, all 105 students were registered and were conducted on a tour of the Bethel home and factory. This helped them to feel acquainted. Since school sessions consist of two two-hour classes and a one-hour lecture period each day, half of the day is spent taking care of work assignments. In this manner the prospective missionaries can get experience in housekeeping and in the kitchen and dining room. This will profit them later on, for each member of a missionary home has his weekly housekeeping and cooking day. Some of the students are additionally given specialized training in the office or factory, depending on the job the Society may have in mind for them in their foreign assignment. So during the days prior to school’s opening they were able to get settled in the regular work routine. On Monday, October 11, all felt almost “at home” as Brother Knorr officially opened the school with a lecture outlining the Society’s purpose in bringing them to the school and how they could fulfill this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Five languages were taught during the forty-first term: Spanish, French, Portuguese, German and Cantonese Chinese. The courses were enriched by the use of the publications released at the “Word of Truth” assembly. In the revised curriculum a thorough study of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie/’ </span><span class="font9">together with research in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> expanding the material and going into greater detail, comprises two courses. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine”</span><span class="font9"> is the basis for another course. Here the fine Scriptural material in the book is studied and used in practical ways as the students give counsel in various situations, answer questions in the preaching work and on radio interviews and before groups of questioners. Language constitutes one course running through the entire term, and the other five courses consist of an analytical study of the Bible, chapter by chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The forty-first class had the privilege of being the first class to use for its graduation exercises the Society’s newly acquired assembly hall, in which the circuit assemblies for the New York city circuits are held. It is a fine theater building, remodeled to suit our purposes, with very comfortable seats and a large, fully carpeted stage. Since 1961 Gilead graduations had been restricted to the Bethel family because of limited room in the Bethel Kingdom Hall. And, although in the new facilities more could attend, limitations had to be set again. This was done by giving five tickets to each student so that he could invite relatives, and one ticket to each member of the Bethel family. Then a ticket was sent to each pioneer in New York city. This practically filled the auditorium, so that at the exercises on graduation day, Sunday, February 27, 1966, a capacity audience of 1,905 was in attendance. Graduating students numbered 103, with assignments to service in forty-one lands. Beginning at 10 a.m. with a song and prayer, the occasion was highlighted by Brother Franz’ talk in which he stressed the urgency of our work as the nations fast approach Armageddon, and Brother Knorr’s moving discussion based on Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13: “I have come to know that there is nothing better for [men] than to rejoice and to do good during one’s life; and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.” The resolution presented by the class voiced appreciation first for the spiritual benefits of the Gilead training and continued: “Our expression of appreciation would not be complete without mentioning the many material benefits provided by Jehovah through the Bethel family and the contributions of the whole association of our brothers world wide. For these we are truly grateful. However, these words here expressed will have deeper meaning when we carry out the work assigned in the missionary field for which we have been trained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the afternoon at 1:30 came the students’ part of this special day: first, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study conducted by Brother Knorr with comments from the students, then the student program. That they had worked hard in preparation was manifest to the audience. With a fine variety of musical interludes punctuating the serious, instructive parts, the two hours passed swiftly. “The Superiority of Christ’s Priesthood,” showing the beneficial effect of the Bible book of Hebrews on the first-century Christians, a reenactment of a scene from the book of Job, an analytical report on 1 Corinthians, chapters 2 and 3, lifelike scenes of missionaries using their newly learned languages in their assignments climaxed by “Jehovah’s Vindication the Important Thing,” with stirring scenes from the prophet Jeremiah’s experiences—all gave the audience a glimpse of things learned at Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Between the forty-first and forty-second classes, the circuit and district servants in the United States came in to attend special sessions of the revised Kingdom Ministry School. The two-week course was exactly the same as that enjoyed by congregation servants and assistants at South Lansing, New York. Three classes of seventy-five each filled in the time between Gilead terms. After this, six classes of about twenty-five each ran concurrently with Gilead’s forty-second class, so both groups experienced the unique privilege of association for a few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The forty-second class to attend the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead convened April 25. There were 106 students enrolled from thirteen different countries. It was indeed a pleasure to have these students during the year, as it has been to have all the other students that have come from afar and willingly volunteered to enter the foreign missionary field. Gilead missionaries are always upbuilding to their brothers in the congregations with which they associate in other lands and they have proved to be a real blessing to persons seeking truth and righteousness as they go from house to house. It is a privilege to publish the names of all those who have graduated from the Gilead School during the past year, the fortieth and forty-first classes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 318,559 Population: 192,854,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 605</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses were telling the people of the United States from one end of the land to the other that it is impossible for God to lie. This certainly aroused interest during the twelve months of the 1965-1966 service year. Never before in the past twenty years had we reached such a high distribution of bound books as we attained this year, namely, a distribution of 2,481,697 bound books. This is the ninth time in twenty years that we have passed the two-million mark in the distribution of bound books, but this year’s was the highest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> is an excellent publication to use in Bible study work, and naturally Bible studies increased during the year, the average being 233,588 Bible studies conducted weekly for the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We did not have the increase in the average number of publishers that we had hoped for, although there was a one-percent increase. Now throughout the United States we have 305,481 regular monthly publishers, on the average, declaring the good news. We feel that a very thorough witness was given in the country, but we also know there is still a lot of work to be done if all sorts of people are to be given an opportunity to hear. We are confident that the brothers in the United States will put forth an extraordinary effort during this new service year to reach just as many people as possible with the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> and the new publication </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting ■—in Freedom of the Sons of God.</span><span class="font10"> Additionally, they will be using Bibles, magazines and other publications to give an extensive witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There have been some very fine experiences enjoyed by the brothers and sisters in the United States, and here are some you will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“When did you people begin doing this?” a woman asked after the Witness at her door offered a free home Bible study weekly, using the householder’s Bible. “I thought you only left Bible literature.” Another said: “You mean you will come and study with me? I can’t believe that anyone does such things today.” Many such experiences resulted from following the Society’s suggestion that after introducing ourselves we offer to study the Bible free of charge, using the householder’s Bible or making one available for $1. Many found it an excellent means to start studies. One circuit servant writes: “In the last two months my wife and I have started fifty-nine Bible studies!” One sister says: “I was able to start seven studies in one day!” The effect on the public is good also, for many, even if not interested, are startled and say, “Thank you,” or, “It’s a good thing someone is doing this work,” or as one man put it, “I think you have been touched by God’s spirit.” The brothers report that the studies are more solidly based from the first study, for the householder knows just why we are coming to his home each week. A servant said: “The publishers love it, for it is easy and makes something concrete for back-calls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brothers who work unassigned and little-worked areas enjoy many fine privileges. In one such territory the car wound up and up through hills, over bumps and ruts and across a creek with no bridge, finally to find a house. The man immediately asked the Witness who was calling: “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” “Yes.” “Good, I’ve been waiting a long time for one to call.” When asked how long, he said: “Well, it’s been about twelve years!” He had quit his church because the members’ actions were not Christian. The publishers did not have a chance to give a regular sermon, for the man was full of questions about baptism, hell and other doctrines. On the first back-call he greeted them: “Now I haven’t decided definitely to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but I’ve been thinking seriously of it.” The study is progressing nicely. After waiting about twelve years to be called on, within just a few weeks’ time he recognized the truth and began talking to his fellow worker, even placing literature with him. His wife opposed and his family refused to listen, but he drives thirty miles each way to meetings, which he began to attend after the second call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All kinds of men are learning the truth. A Baptist minister opened the door to two brothers and, after listening to their sermon, eagerly accepted a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book. He had quit the ministry because he was sick at heart over what he saw going on in the church. “I want to serve God too, but know I’m not pleasing him now,” he told the two. Anxious about the back-call, the brothers returned three days later and were greeted enthusiastically at the door. “Never before was I so eager to learn. I never felt like this when attending school to become a minister,” he said. As the brothers left after a very lively time, he pleaded: “Now don’t forget about me. If you don’t come out, I’ll come and get you. Don’t give up on me now.” After learning Bible truth on hell and the soul he said: “What about the people I’ve been teaching these wrong things to?” He was encouraged to share the good news with them. His greatest desire is for his wife and ten children (ages four months to fourteen years) to live under the new system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many find patient letter-writing is a means of aiding relatives to learn the truth. A young man who lived in his sister’s home thought she was “a religious nut” because she witnessed to him as she learned the truth. As soon as he got out of school he joined the army and went to Korea, partly to get away from her. In Korea he was very lonely, and his sister, his closest relative, wrote him two or three times each week, always witnessing and sometimes sending magazines. Finally, he asked her to quit sending pamphlets and talking about that religion. She wrote a short letter saying the family was fine, the weather the same, that she couldn’t think of anything else to write, for her religion was a big part of her life. She waited a month to mail it. Immediately he fired back a letter: “Write about anything, write about your religion, just write, and send </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!”</span><span class="font9"> The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet was sent and how to study it explained. Each week letters were exchanged as a study. On returning home, he continued to study and today he is baptized, married to a Witness, is an appointed servant and gives hour talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There have not been any outstanding difficulties that the brothers have encountered in connection with their field service activity during the year. There were some slight interferences brought about by uninformed police officers who sought to apply ordinances in certain towns and cities that were inapplicable. An effort was made to break up a circuit assembly in Idaho by the mayor’s threatening to arrest every person going from door to door. However, his efforts were frustrated by a 100-percent turnout on the part of the publishers for field service. A subsequent bomb scare during the public meeting resulted in much favorable newspaper publicity because of the orderly evacuation of the building on the part of the brothers and their return to the auditorium to hear the conclusion of the talk. The few small skirmishes did not interfere with the work, but the publishers continued on faithfully covering their territory just as often as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Singing and Accompanying Yourselves with Music in Your Hearts”</span><span class="font9"> has excited and thrilled the brothers throughout the country. One sister’s husband, not in the truth, has cut down much on his television viewing. Why? He loves to sit and hear the new Kingdom songs on record. A professor at a state university was very impressed with the article in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> on the songbook. On the back-call a servant showed him the new songbook, and he just insisted on hearing the songs. As he played them on the accordian, the circuit servant sang several. On Sunday he came to the public talk, no doubt aided by the “pure language” so evident in the new songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BROOKLYN BETHEL FAMILY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have a very large family living in the Bethel home in Brooklyn, New York. There were 724 members in the family at the close of the 1966 service year. Additionally, we had 106 students going through Gilead School. So in the two large buildings on Columbia Heights we were housing 830 dedicated ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The regular members of the family are assigned to various duties. The greater number of them work at the printing plant, not far from the Bethel home, where we produce Bibles, books and magazines and also ship and mail out all these publications. We have a very large office staff looking after the subscriptions for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines and others are handling the tremendous amount of correspondence coming in and going out of the office. Last year we received 881,116 pieces of mail, all of which needed attention in one of the various offices. There is also the housekeeping work that needs constant attention, cleaning, painting and repairing. We operate a large laundry and a good kitchen for the benefit of the Bethel family. So the factory operation, along with the help needed in the offices and other departments in the Bethel home and the Gilead School, keeps everyone busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are some other members of the Bethel family that do not live right in our Brooklyn home, but they serve the family’s interests very well. There are eighty-three brothers and sisters who live on the Society’s farms. They produce most of the food that is served on our tables. There is Kingdom Farm, near South Lansing, New York; the Watchtower Farm, near Pine Bush, New York, about a hundred miles from Bethel; and Mountain Farm in New Jersey, near Califon, New Jersey, about eighty miles from the Bethel home. These three farms are well equipped and have schedules for work arranged so that the brothers can spend evenings and most weekends in the field service as well as attending meetings. These brothers and sisters must keep their spiritual lives just as strong as any of the congregation publishers throughout the world, and meetings and field service help keep one conscious of his spiritual needs. One who has the proper appreciation of the truth always makes a much better worker and takes a keener interest in his Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the moment the members of the Bethel family and our brothers around the world are very much interested in the progress of the new addition that we are building alongside our present factory at 117 Adams Street in Brooklyn. In the spring of 1965 the Society decided to build on the property it had obtained back in 1956. We were, of course, using the land for religious purposes over the years after 1956, but now we were desirous of putting up a large Bible-printing and bookbinding building. We had some obstacles to overcome with regard to zoning restrictions. After we bought the property the city rezoned the area, so application was made to the zoning board to change the zoning of this particular piece of land, which they readily did. This had to be approved by the Board of Estimate, consisting of the five borough presidents, the mayor and other city officials. These all were unanimously in favor of changing the zoning, and so we now have designed a building that will be ten stories high, and when it is completed sometime near the end of the 1967 service year, we should have an additional 206,000 square feet of floor space, which we really need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We expect to connect this new building by means of a bridge to the fifth and sixth floors of our original building at 117 Adams Street. That building the Society constructed in 1927. By means of bridges all four buildings will be tied together, which will make for very easy access from one building to the other. At the time of writing this report we are able to say that the foundation for the new building has already been put in and the side walls of the basement finished and the forms for the first floor are just being erected. This new structure, when completed, will be the largest single building that the Society has. Two floors will be used for the printing presses, and someday, if Jehovah wills, and the demand is there, we would be able to put in twenty-three more high-speed web rotary presses. Four are on order now, which we hope will be delivered shortly after the factory is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bethel family is very grateful for all the fine provisions that are made for their care here at Bethel. Not only are we provided with all the physical needs, food, clothing and shelter, but we receive good care as to our spiritual needs. All new members of the family go into what we call the Primary Bible School. The study required for this course pretty well occupies all the new members’ evenings for the first six months, but during that six-month period they are able to go through the entire Bible and discuss the various chapters. It certainly gives them a good spiritual foundation for their future years of ministerial activity. Regularly, each morning we discuss the daily text and comments. We have our own family </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study and Theocratic Ministry School, in addition to those that we attend with the congregations in New York city, with which we are assigned to work. So while we are a very large family, we are also the happiest and busiest one in the world and we enjoy accomplishing much, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah. We are indeed happy here because we see the continual growth of Jehovah’s organization, not only in the erecting of new buildings, but also in the handling of thousands of tons of paper, carloads of chipboard and cloth and other material that goes into the manufacture of Bible literature, which we know our brothers will be using around the world. We are grateful to Jehovah God and thank him for our daily bread and all the provisions of life and especially for his undeserved kindness in allowing us to be here to serve our brothers world wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING ACTIVITY IN BROOKLYN PRINTING PLANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Over the past several years we have been happy to see the large increase in magazine production year by year. However, this past year there was practically no increase in the magazine production, as you will observe in the following production chart. But it was gratifying to see the heavy demand for the bound books. Our bindery machinery was kept very busy all year under a heavy schedule, resulting in the production of 7,602,858 bound books, which was a new peak for a year’s production in our Brooklyn plant. This was an increase of 1,927,243 over last year. It was good to see that these books were being used in the field and were not being stored in the Brooklyn plant, because, during the year, our shipping department was very busy shipping out 8,023,356 bound books and Bibles. The year before we shipped out only 5,436,424. Very likely this splendid increase in the use of books in the field can be mainly attributed to the enthusiastic response to the fine new book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font9"> During the past year 3,842,667 copies were produced, thus bringing the grand total to 5,786,214 copies since its release in June of 1965. Since this timely book is proving so beneficial in the field for Bible education, we are glad to have been able during the year to add ten more languages to the list in which it has been published, thereby bringing the total to twelve languages in which the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font9"> has been published in the Brooklyn plant. However, this is not the end for this book, as we presently have six more languages in process in the Brooklyn factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are a variety of items produced in the factory and, to provide you with an interesting comparison of the main items produced over the past three years, we are providing the following production chart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">To produce the above-listed literature took 9,915 tons of paper. It took 530 tons of cardboard and 579,946 square yards of cloth for the covers of the books, along with much other material that goes into the making of a book. At our printing plant we also manufacture many of our own products such as our own ink, of which we produced 284,024 pounds, to supply our 33 printing presses. We also made 186,263 pounds of adhesives that are used in the binding of books and the mailing of magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are very thankful to Jehovah for our privilege of service and glad we are working along with God’s ministers scattered throughout the world, preaching this good news of God’s kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations before the end comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT ON OTHER TERRITORIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The island of Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean and four islands in the Pacific—Guam, Ponape, Saipan and Truk—are handled directly from the office of the president because there are no nearby branch offices. So we get all their field service reports direct and look after their interests. Here are some experiences that have taken place on these various islands.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BERMUDA Peak Publishers: 107</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">During the past service year in Bermuda, sixteen new publishers started in the field service. Unfortunately this increase was not reflected by an increase in publishers. The difference was the number who became inactive and who now require special assistance. The admonition now constantly given us to look well to these spiritually sick ones applies in a very real sense to the congregation in Bermuda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some progress is being made, as in the case of an elderly, incapacitated sister who finds it difficult to attend meetings and who gradually became very despondent and inactive. Arrangements were made for another sister, herself advanced in years, to visit her weekly. She wrote about these visits as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;I visit our sister every week unless it rains. I spend a few minutes bringing her up to date with announcements and happenings in the congregation. Then we study the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book, and I follow the general pattern of the congregation book study, opening with prayer, discussing and reading the paragraphs. We go into matters very thoroughly and ask more questions than in the book. This helps to refresh her memory. On some special points I take a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> or an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> on the subject and discuss it in conjunction with the study. I also take the current Ministry School review paper. The sister fills this out and I correct it when I go the next week. We look up all the wrong answers to be sure to understand things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“We thoroughly enjoy this time together. It gives her needed association and is spiritually upbuilding for both of us. It enables her to keep up with the congregation even though absent. I find her in her wheelchair at the window watching for me. She is very appreciative and always thanks me for coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the pioneers has had a good experience helping a Seventh-day Adventist pastor grow in appreciation for the truth despite opposition from his organization. This minister has publicly proclaimed from the pulpit the good example of Jehovah’s witnesses and advised those in his congregation to follow their steps. At his invitation we were able to address a gathering of about fifty of his members and distribute magazines to each. Studies have been started through him with three of his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GUAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49,771</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 55 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 905</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our largest gathering in Guam was 164 that attended the funeral of one of the local sisters. The faith, determination and integrity she displayed during her illness were an example and encouragement to all of us. One is never too old to learn the truth and dedicate oneself to Jehovah God. She was seventy-two years of age. This sister had been a Catholic all her life, but recognized the truth when she heard it. (John 18:37) When taken to the hospital by her son, who is also studying, there was quite a stir when they found out she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. She had been a nurse in the hospital for many years so almost everyone knew her. Now the pressure began for her to change back to being a Catholic and to take a blood transfusion. During her stay in the hospital, priests, nuns and nurses visited her often, trying to persuade her to take blood. She still held fast to God’s law forbidding the eating of blood, though all her life she had eaten </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fatada,</span><span class="font9"> a local food made with blood. Her trust and faith in Jehovah God and his arrangement were evident in her words: “It is up to Jehovah God, as he is the Life-giver.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The son had an opportunity to witness to the family doctor, a Seventh-day Adventist. He was able to use his Bible to show why a Christian would not take blood in any form or manner. He used Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:10-14 and Acts 15:19, 20, 29. He told the doctor: “My mother does not want to be cut off from God and lose her opportunity for future life. She would rather sleep in death for a short while and have the hope of being brought forth in the resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One last try to break her integrity occurred when she was in a near-coma. They held a cross near her face, telling her that if she looked at it she would be giving her consent to be buried in the Catholic cemetery. To their disappointment she turned away. All their persuasion had failed, and she died faithful to Jehovah. Three of her children are studying and one niece is going in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PONAPE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,958</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,896</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was in the latter part of March 1965 when the Society’s first missionaries arrived to begin the preaching work in the tropical islands of this district. By Memorial of the following year sixty-five persons gathered to observe the event. Earlier in the year at one showing of the Society’s 1958 Assembly film over</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">one-sixth of the island’s population attended, and by the close of the service year four interested persons had symbolized their dedication to Jehovah, becoming the firstfruits of God’s sons of liberty in this district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of these new Witnesses was first reached as a result of the argument at the funeral mentioned in last year’s report. He was the son of the elderly preacher who broke up the mob and was contacted the week after. From that first visit developed thrice-weekly studies, he carefully examining our teachings and way of life. The hypocrisy of his former religious system had thoroughly disgusted him and what was found in the truth proved satisfying. The subject of neutrality then came up for discussion, and careful examination of the Scriptural view was made. This was extremely important in his case, as he was a representative of the Ponape District Legislature. His decision to resign was no problem, however, as he was convinced of the truth. The problem was with the Legislature itself, as they kept postponing their scheduled regular sessions. This brother did not want to submit his resignation while the Legislature was not in session, as some misunderstanding of his position might have resulted, and so waited until finally they convened and then submitted his resignation. Of course, a lot of talk developed, but it was expected. The next day, being neutral and acceptable before Jehovah, he symbolized his dedication in one of the many rivers here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are very pleased in mentioning that good progress has been made as regards our Kingdom Hall. The foundation has been dug already and is ready to be poured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SAIPAN, MARIANA ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,404</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,401</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the time that the good news has been preached here, no native has been able to make a complete break from the fetters of Babylon that have held them in bondage and fear for so long a time. As in other places where the Catholic church has exercised much control over the people, many do not understand that the Bible is the Word of God and that by reading it they may hear their heavenly Father speak to and instruct them. The hatred of the Bible by Christendom’s would-be shepherds of the flock can most easily be seen by the reaction of many of the children. They may hold their images out the windows shouting, “Go home,” to the publishers as they enter the territory, or they cross themselves and begin chanting “Hail Marys” as they pass the publishers on the street. On other occasions young boys dance around in front of the publishers making obscene gestures, or try to scare them off with a barrage of rocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yet among such persons there are those who have a listening ear. While they are told that it is a sin to talk to Jehovah’s witnesses and that no good Catholic would do that, some do listen to the Kingdom message, doing so even though their faces reflect the fear that has been put in their hearts. But we know that, with continued patience, God’s love will reach the hearts of some of these persons, blotting out that fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26,602</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 8,867</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The highlight of our service year was the visit of the circuit servant and the showing of one of the Society’s films. We were happy to be able to show the film in six different villages on Moen Island. We had a combined attendance of about 1,600, which is well over one-third the population of the island. Many comments of appreciation were heard afterward and the people were especially impressed with the number of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the world and how they baptize by complete immersion rather than by sprinkling in a church. After our showing the film, more studies opened up than the publishers could handle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The local people who are interested in the truth appreciate that their children are included in the home Bible studies and that they are encouraged to participate in congregation meetings. The following experience shows the benefit of giving attention to children. An elderly Catholic man approached the young son of a new publisher with the desire to discourage his further study with Jehovah’s witnesses. The man ridiculed many of the boy’s beliefs. The subject of baptism came up because the boy’s father had been immersed recently in water. He criticized Jehovah’s witnesses for not baptizing babies. The boy referred him to Matthew 28:19 and other verses explaining that one must have faith as a disciple of Jesus before he can be baptized in the sight of God. The man got quite angry, but the boy remembered the counsel of 1 Peter 3:15 and answered the elderly man with respect and a mild temper. The next day this man met the boy’s father and told him: “After I left your son yesterday I felt like crying. I’ve been a Catholic most of my life, but I couldn’t defend my religion. Yet every time I asked him something about his religion, he opened up his Bible and read me the answer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ALASKA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;269,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 594 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 453</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The high point of the 1966 service year in Alaska was the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly in Anchorage. The brothers were overjoyed to see 1,600 persons attending the public meeting. Heretofore there had never been more than 600 at an assembly. There were many visitors from the “outside,” as they say in Alaska, and many of these Witnesses that came to the convention have expressed interest in returning to Alaska to live and take up the ministry. Jehovah’s witnesses in this far northern area have had a very fine year of service, with new peaks in total numbers of publishers, hours and Bible studies. There is still much work to be done in Alaska, and the branch servant gives us information on this point as well as some fine experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of our main concerns is reaching into isolated places. While 80 percent of the population lives in congregation territory, the other 20 percent is scattered over vast regions. Often people who have studied with or been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses move to isolated towns and drift away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This year two pioneer sisters were sent to one such town on a temporary special assignment. Before they went, we knew of three inactive sisters in the town. But the pioneers immediately found many homes where seeds of truth had been planted, some by missionaries as much as twenty years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One involved a woman who expressed great appreciation for their work, saying that so many people there needed help, especially her. When return calls were made she avoided them, admitting to another person that she could not face them because of the life she was leading. The sisters persisted, so finally she asked if the older pioneer sister would come alone, as the younger one was just too young to even hear such a story as hers. The older pioneer sister was able to assure her that it was possible for her to clean up her life, and that they would help her. From that day on she did not miss one of the meetings while the pioneers were there, and the change in the family has been a witness to the whole town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sisters worked hard and they described their experiences as “overwhelming.” In two months they drove 2,000 miles back and forth over the twenty-seven miles of road in the area. A </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study and a book study were started with a consistent attendance of twenty or more right from the start, and eight persons now actively publish the good news. All those associating were worried about what they would do after the pioneers left. How happy they were when the sisters announced their plans to return soon as special pioneers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sometimes special arrangements must be worked out during severely cold weather, and these often produce outstanding results. In one of the colder cities the circuit servant helped the brothers work out this arrangement: When the temperature drops below -35 degrees they discontinue door-to-door work and meet in their service centers to write letters, using addresses from telephone books for isolated towns. They have all the necessary supplies at the service centers and the study conductor gives assistance with the letters as needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Incidental witnessing may often have far-reaching effects, even in reaching people who have shown opposition. A young man working on a barge was witnessed to in a logging camp by a brother who worked as a shipwright. His interest was stimulated, and when he could he attended some meetings. Later, again in a logging camp, he encountered another Witness and more extensive Bible discussions resulted. His partner (one who was known to the Witnesses as a person opposed to the truth) tried to prove the Bible contradictory, but his opposition soon changed to finding a way to explain the Bible truths to his wife. When his partner returned home, his wife saw such a change in him that she considered leaving him, but soon she realized that the change was for the good, as he had quit drinking excessively. Now a Bible study is being held in this home where opposition had formerly been found, and all three of these persons are progressing in the truth.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark152"></a>With an 8-percent increase in the number of publishers in Argentina during the past year, further expansion was required in the Bethel home. The Society made provisions to add another floor to the present structure. Our brothers there feel that as we move along toward the end of this system of things greater efforts must be put forth to preach the Word. They say: “As long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) If we all do what is fine and we do not give out, we will receive the blessing of Jehovah. The circuit and district servants are stressing the importance of visiting publishers who have become inactive, and, during the last series of circuit assemblies, reports were received that 220 of these “related to us in the faith” have been helped to return to the Kingdom Hall and to active service. This makes our hearts glad. Some very interesting experiences have been submitted by the branch servant.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">When help is offered, as a rule it is accepted. During the visit of the district servant with the circuit servant, it was decided that each of them would go with a different servant and visit inactive publishers. The report tells us that they “visited three families, two inactive and another that was irregular; in all, five baptized publishers. We were able to start two studies where the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font9"> book had not been finished. Sunday these five ex-publishers came to the meeting for the first time in a year and a half and they also brought other interested persons. Not only did they come Sunday but also Saturday night, even making some comments.” Servants, remember, we want to help these that are “related to us in the faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you do not have a study, why not try vacation pioneering? A sister writes that she was not able to start studies and decided to be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> vacation pioneer for two weeks. She says that she had to make a lot of arrangements, since she has her home to care for and two young children. Here are her remarks: “I pioneered for two weeks and in this time I was able to start two studies. I am so happy now that I am able to report studies like many other publishers in my congregation. I suggest that others who do not have studies try the pioneer work and I know that they too will have the same joy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This report would not be complete if we did not express thanks, first to Jehovah and then to the brothers who showed such a keen interest in “those related to us in the faith” during the floods this year in the north of the country. It is a pleasure to report that more than ten tons of clothing and foods were contributed by the brothers as well as a large sum of money, in fact, enough to help a number of brothers rebuild their homes and build two new Kingdom Halls. The brothers in the distressed section of the country expressed their deep appreciation for all that was done by the Society and their brothers. It is another evidence of the unity of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Proverbs 25:15 says: “A mild tongue itself can break a bone.” Yes, even demon power and influence can be broken. A sister tells this experience: “Many times I tried to witness to a strongly Catholic lady in my territory. Her son was of the Catholic Action. I was always turned away rudely. One day I was passing this same house and the lady called me. Her first comment was, ‘Although I treated you rudely, you still treat me kindly; even though I turned you away from my door, you come willingly and without a grudge.’ The lady went on to tell me about her troubles and why she had called me. She was very sickly and not able to do her housework. Her husband had a good-paying job, but regardless of what was brought into the home it was spent on her sickness. No treatment did her any good. In the home there were always strange noises and a hand bothered her at night. She looked to God for help, said long prayers using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">rosario </span><span class="font9">until early in the morning, but she was not able to sleep with the lights out. Even after praying she would be worse the next morning. She decided to change her religion. She wanted to know something about the Bible and for this reason she called me. After hearing this and going into the house I heard a loud noise in one of the clothes closets, but the lady said not to be alarmed, that this was common in the house. It must have been the wicked influence going out when I came into the house. I placed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’ </span><span class="font9">book with her and a study was started. The noises disappeared and the hand did not bother her anymore at night. She can sleep now with the lights off, and her health is better. She is able to do her own work without help. The money that comes into the home takes care of all things now. This lady now attends the meetings, is talking the truth to all, and wants to go from house to house. It is her desire to be baptized at the 1967 assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRALIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,537,560</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17,449 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 661</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Australia did very well in their Bible study activity during the past service year. This is one of the outstanding features of the ministry carried on in that country. They have used the method of asking people directly if they would like to study the Bible and have had good results. This has increased their teaching work. The Branch reports that one circuit servant and his wife started forty studies during one week when they visited one of the congregations. A number of other traveling representatives are reporting similar success. The result has been continual peaks in Bible study work throughout Australia, with the month of August showing an all-time high in this feature of service. The people of Australia are being reached and many are responding to the truth found in God’s Word. A few of the experiences had by our brothers are reported herewith as provided by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How essential the watering of the planted seed is, was demonstrated by a sister when she came across a woman who admitted reading many books on religion such as the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Koran</span><span class="font9"> and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Mormon,</span><span class="font9"> but reaching the conclusion that religion generally was a racket. However, the sister noted a spark of interest and decided on a return visit, taking along with her the book study conductor. She thought in this way that she would have assistance in overcoming any of the objections the householder might have, thus helping her to see the difference between Christendom and Christianity as presented from God’s Word. On this return visit the woman listened intently and surprised the sister by agreeing with the message given. As she stated, her father, being </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> Jew, was put into prison in Germany during the second world war, and the only “church minister” who ever came to see him was an overseer of Jehovah’s witnesses. She stated that this brother showed tremendous faith and courage to do this, and as a result of trying to help her father he was arrested by the police and later shot. His genuine effort to plant seed brought the Jewish man’s wife into the truth and she is now an active Witness in Germany. After relating these things to the sister in Australia, the daughter said she was definitely prepared to do something about the truth, as she knew that is what it was, and so she was willing to sacrifice her time and go from door to door telling people about God’s kingdom. She is now looking into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet and building up her knowledge so that she too can continue to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">grow</span><span class="font9"> under Jehovah’s direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our young publishers are able to do some fine work, too, as reported by one of them: “Recently at school I had a very interesting experience. We were having a lesson on citizenship and the teacher was explaining jury service. She said some people could be exempt from jury service for religious reasons, such as Jehovah’s witnesses. This started off a full class discussion. I listened for a while, then announced that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and some of the things they were saying were not true. The teacher asked me to prepare a talk, and this was set down for the next lesson the following week. She also asked if anyone else in the class would like to talk about his religion, but no one volunteered, so she assigned a reluctant Church of England girl to speak on her religion. The following week I was able to give a talk to forty-one girls in my class, covering points such as, Who is Jehovah?, What we bear witness to, Our moral training and home life. I also read the texts directly from the Bible to show God’s law regarding blood. After the talk, there were questions. I was able to explain Armageddon, the new earth, our meetings and our worldwide work. I then showed them our family picture scrapbook. The teacher held up the convention pictures and said to the class, ‘Do you think you will ever go to one?’ The session lasted half an hour. Everyone clapped and a number of the girls questioned me afterward. The Church of England girl had only five minutes remaining to discuss her religion.” So young praisers of Jehovah can give a fine witness in many ways and spread the good news of the Kingdom to their school companions in a worthwhile way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The attitude of not missing any of the territory assigned to us or any of the persons in that territory is well demonstrated by a sister who contacted a Maltese priest. She related that she had quite an interesting talk with him and he accepted the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font9"> and several magazines, saying he would like to have further discussions. Since then she has been able to make several calls on him at the seminary, and among the subjects discussed they have touched on the position of Babylon the Great, the stand a Christian should take during war, idolatry and a number of other things. This priest shows a meek attitude and will always accept what the Bible has to say. He continues to show interest, and the sister is hoping that one day he will make a break from Babylon the Great. So it is good to work all our territory and not just what we think should be worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This experience is of a brother ninety-two years of age, who tells us: “I have had many happy years in Jehovah’s service and have been working since 1923 in the service, pioneering in 1929. Now, of course, my age limits me from doing as much work as I would like to do, but I am extremely grateful that my health allows me to go out in the service regularly each week. I now spend my service time distributing tracts, invitations and magazines. Last month I was able to place 538 magazines, and most of these were distributed in street work in a busy shopping centre in our congregation. The joys and blessings I receive from Jehovah in His service make me feel as the psalmist did when he said: ‘You arrange before me a table in front of those showing hostility to me. With oil you have greased my head; my cup is well filled. Surely goodness and loving-kindness themselves will pursue me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah to the length of days.’—Psalm 23: 5, 6.” As a result of hearing of this brother’s zeal a sister seventy-eight years of age applied for vacation pioneering, as she said she was only “a chicken” compared with this brother. She writes: “I just feel I must tell you about the wonderful time I spent during the month as a vacation pioneer with a dedicated sister. It was the happiest time of my life that I can remember.” These experiences show that, even though we may be old, in Jehovah’s service there is much we can do in sending up a shout of praise to his holy name and continuing faithfully down to the end. May we follow their good example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AUSTRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,215,400</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8,205 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 879</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the past service year in Austria many of the weaker congregations were combined with larger ones where convenient, so that the stronger servant organization could give attention to some of the brothers who needed spiritual help. Better programs were organized for the meetings and more efficient and thorough assistance was given to the brothers individually. This proved to be a great aid to many of the brothers who were in smaller and weaker congregations, but who still were able to travel the greater distance to attend meetings with larger congregations. The branch office gave special attention to large cities too, and encouraged everyone to work these centers of population. Special pioneers were assigned to cities like Vienna, where the population ratio was only one to 974, and to other cities with a higher ratio. This has been an encouragement to some of the congregations that wanted their more heavily populated sections to be covered. It takes efficient planning to get territory covered, but our purpose in life is to see to it that this good news of the Kingdom is preached everywhere. A few interesting experiences have been sent in from the Austrian branch office and we set them out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a publisher was unable to make further progress with an interested young man whose parents were strongly opposed to the truth and to his letting Witnesses into the house, the publisher invited him to come over to his own home. Now for the first time the basic truths of God’s Word could be discussed without disturbance. At home, however, opposition continued. The young man was not even allowed to have the lights on in his room evenings for fear he would study. But he was able to overcome the problem by reading his Bible in bed with a flashlight. His determination was blessed, and soon he was baptized as a symbol of his dedication to do God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“What can we do to help our sister whose husband, an inactive publisher, now has forbidden her attending meetings?” That was the question that confronted a circuit servant and an overseer. Some sort of practical action had to be taken. An optimistic course was decided upon: Talk with the now-opposing husband. After repeated unsuccessful attempts the husband was contacted at home. In the ensuing discussion he was shown from the Bible that the vindication of Jehovah’s name, not human failings of individuals, should be uppermost in our minds. Following preliminary aversion, including a flood of angry expressions on the part of the husband, the tactful, patient and yet bold efforts of the circuit servant and the overseer were rewarded. The husband’s attitude changed and he agreed to the overseer’s conducting a Bible study with him so as to give him a fresh start in the truth. In the meantime he has resumed his preaching activity, he and his whole family attend meetings regularly, and he is an exemplary family head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Excellent prospects exist for further expansion in our country as is evidenced by the 12,335 persons attending the Memorial celebration last April. May Jehovah help us to give practical assistance and proper encouragement to the many interested ones already associating with his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BAHAMAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130,721</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 324 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 403</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean known as the Bahamas were well served again during the 1966 service year by Jehovah’s witnesses. The Kingdom publishers themselves did not neglect the house of their God, and as they went from house to house they encouraged the newly interested ones to attend the meetings. Before the year was past there were eighteen new ones baptized, and there was a 5-percent increase in publishers. The brothers were able to spend more hours in the field service, distribute more bound books and booklets, increase the distribution of their </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines, and conduct more Bible studies than the year before. Here are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a few</span><span class="font10"> experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the problems that faces us is that of reaching the people that live on the out islands, especially on the small out-of-the-way cays. To solve this problem in part, during August six brothers traveled over the open seas sixty miles in two fifteen-foot outboard motorboats to the small island of Grand Cay, where about 200 people live. It is not known whether anyone had ever visited this island with the message of truth before. The circuit servant reported: “Literature was left in almost every home. The people proved to be very friendly, even offering to lead us to the next house and introduce us.” On the way back one of the motors stopped and the boat had to be towed, but the brothers felt well rewarded in spite of the danger involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many times back-calls can be made and studies started in most unusual ways if one is alert to his or her opportunities and takes the initiative. Let us hear from a missionary who did just this: “Hearing of a young nurse who had attempted suicide, I felt a desire to talk to her. I made a visit to the mental hospital where the young woman was under twenty-four-hour-a-day surveillance. There was not much conversation at that time. I expressed the thought that we wanted to help her, and that there was an opportunity for her to share in a wonderful future if she would allow me time to tell her about it. She was deeply impressed that a stranger, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, had taken the trouble to concern herself about her. A brief explanation of God’s purpose for the earth opened up a glimpse of something very different from this present evil system of things with its selfishness, cruelty and uncertainty. Next week a study was started. Her mind is quick and receptive. In discussing the sign of the end, her reaction to reading the result to the preachers of the good news, that they would be hated of all nations for his name’s sake, was, 'That must be very reassuring to you all.’ When I told her I would be away for a vacation, she said, ‘Can you not arrange for someone else to study with me while you are away?’ thus showing her concern to keep gaining the knowledge that will give her courage to face the problems of the present day and also the hope to live on an untroubled earth under God’s kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BARBADOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;245,275</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 759 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 323</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On January 1, 1966, the Society opened a new branch office on the island of Barbados. We feel we will be able to give better attention to Kingdom interests on this island as well as the nearby islands of Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent. All these islands make up the branch territory. During the 1967 service year the Society hopes to renovate completely some property that it has purchased, fixing up a house that is standing on the property, transforming it into a new branch office and missionary home. The Society also intends to build a Kingdom Hall on this property and the Bridgetown congregation will be using it. Right after the district assembly finished, nineteen brothers, ten from the islands and nine from Barbados, assembled to form the first class of the new fourteen-day Kingdom Ministry School. The instructions received by the overseers in the congregations should be very beneficial and help advance the work throughout the islands. The Branch reports experiences from all the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly held in the Garrison Savannah, Barbados, in August for all six islands brought a grand climax to the Branch’s first year. Attendance grew to 1,282 Sunday afternoon and 1,667 gathered for the public meeting. Ten were immersed. Overwhelmed by the fine conduct of the delegates, the Savannah manager said: “All of your people, young and old, treated me with such kindness and respect that I felt like a foreigner. I’m not used to treatment like that. You are welcome back here any time and I will certainly put in a good word for you.” The excellent program, the beautiful new Kingdom songs with their meaningful words, the improved organization and the fine spirit of the brothers combined to make this assembly the most stimulating yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With more than forty publishers becoming inactive during the year and in view of a fairly high percentage of irregularity in the ministry, there is a big need for more shepherding work by appointed servants and mature ministers. Over twenty of the forty have been helped back to activity. Note the blessing this has been to one family. “We had been in the truth for twenty-two years but were drawn into the world by materialism. We often felt we wanted to attend the meetings but it just seemed as if we couldn’t make it. We didn’t really fit into Satan’s system, so we were completely disconnected, isolated between the new and the old systems of things. Although wanting and needing our brothers, we always felt we had to dodge them, and this left us frustrated and depressed. We needed words of encouragement. These finally came when the circuit servant and the overseer visited us one Wednesday evening. We gladly accepted the provision of a Bible study in our home. Now we are all back in Jehovah’s secure organization. I cannot express the happiness I feel. Our entire home is governed according to Bible principles. We have learned from our experience how necessary it is to apply all instructions from the Society, have a family Bible study and do our Bible reading daily.” Soon after this family started back they began urging another family in similar circumstances. Now they too are rejoicing at being able to come back home to their loving Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Should we follow up magazine placements even when no interest is apparent? A publisher writes: “Although one man argued stubbornly, I was able to place two magazines with him. I did not call back because his attitude put me off. However, I always gave him a friendly greeting on the road and one Saturday he approached me and requested more magazines. I offered a subscription and he accepted. He said: ‘That magazine you left did a lot for me. One article was just what I had been needing in my family life. It has helped us all.’ I lost no time in calling back to begin a study with the whole family. After thirty minutes he volunteered: ‘This is the most important half hour I have spent in my entire life.’ The whole family continues to study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BEQUIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 195</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How greatly the brothers here are rejoicing! The special pioneer couple report: “We are happy to say that we have enjoyed the 1966 service year, although we have had a very hard time hunting for and feeding the sheeplike ones. Physically we are weary but spiritually we are refreshed, for we are beginning to see the fruitage of our labors. Attendance at meetings has increased and average publishers have jumped from seventeen to twenty. Another cause for us to be happy is that the Society has approved our application to be formed into the Port Elizabeth Congregation. Our prayer is that this newly established congregation will never neglect the house of our God.” The Kingdom Hall that they began last year is practically completed and it is proving to be a blessing for the brothers and their Bible students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CARRIACOU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,800</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 283</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although a number of brothers migrated from Car-riacou, the congregation, made up of one special and one regular pioneer and twenty-two publishers, registered an average of twenty-four active ministers throughout the year, for a 5-percent increase in Kingdom proclaimers. Contributing heavily to this increase was the loving care and encouragement given by the servants to those who had fallen away from ministerial service. “One Witness had been inactive for more than ten years and had stopped associating with the congregation, yet she responded well to a discussion of Galatians 6:9, 10, and after four visits she began coming to meetings and going out in Kingdom service. Another sister was very irregular in attending meetings and had not witnessed publicly for twelve years. The Scriptures helped her to see what Jehovah requires of his servants. She began making ‘public declaration’ after six Bible discussions and her meeting attendance improved too. Since becoming active in the ministry she has averaged ten hours every month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GRENADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85,167</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 179 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 476</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More and more, Jehovah’s witnesses are becoming known for their ability to give accurate answers to Bible questions, thus drawing more persons to a knowledge of the truth. “After hearing a particular statement made by a preacher over the radio, one householder who had turned away many Kingdom publishers from her door decided that only Jehovah’s witnesses would be able to give her the correct Scriptural facts in explanation of the clergyman’s remark. (She had read some of the Society’s publications while living in the Netherlands Antilles.) She called out to me while I was witnessing with a group, invited me in, and asked what I thought about the preacher’s statement. Following a thorough discussion of the matter from the Bible to her satisfaction, she gave me an open invitation for a return visit. My third call resulted in a home Bible study. Later, when a vacation pioneer sister accompanied me on the study and remarked to the householder that she was one who previously had been turned away from the home, the woman smiled and said: ‘You must really forgive me, for I did not know any better. I assure you that I am very sorry that I did.’ Now she regularly attends all the meetings at the Kingdom Hall and is looking forward to symbolizing her dedication to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. LUCIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99,084</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 103 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 962</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That children are not too young to be taught God’s Word can be seen from a boy of seven years who had a burning desire to take his first communion. “His grandmother, newly a Witness, was encouraged to start a home Bible study with him in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book. He also sits in on the study held for the grandmother’s benefit. Now this boy has taken a bold stand for the truth. He told his schoolteacher that God has no mother, for Mary is the mother of Jesus. When other relatives tried to stimulate his interest in the first communion, he stood firm. He asked his grandmother to pray to Jehovah that he would not be one of those chosen for the first communion. He recites the Bible books by heart, comments at the meetings and assists his grandmother to place magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. VINCENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;82,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 88 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 982</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When a member of the household shows opposition to Bible study in the home, use the first opportunity to be “ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect,” as this special pioneer did. “After a few studies a woman’s husband found out and became very angry, telling her not to study with Jehovah’s witnesses any longer. She told him how much she had learned in just a few weeks. She added: ‘Imagine attending church for fifty years and not knowing God’s name is Jehovah!’ She made it clear that she would not be going back to church. When I arrived the next week he was there. When he asked why I didn’t stay home instead of bothering people week after week and especially on such a rainy day, I explained. That same evening after the study she said a prayer, thanking Jehovah for the truth she had learned and for sending me. The husband no longer opposes. He even sits in on the study whenever he is home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When you say you will call back, do you keep your word? “A sister called on a woman who took two magazines. She promised to return but failed. About a year later I called on the same person. She took more magazines. I kept my word and called back. After a Bible discussion she obtained the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book and a study was begun. She said: ‘I have long wanted something like this and now I am happy.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BELGIUM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,499,234</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8,996 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,056</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Belgium are pleased to send one of the finest reports ever compiled for this country. There have been fine increases in every field of activity, in publishers, in distribution of literature and in Bible studies. All of this reflected itself in the establishment of thirty-one new congregations in Belgium. The Branch is also very happy to report that they now have nineteen Italian congregations, one Spanish and three Greek, as well as the usual French and Flemish congregations. Outstanding during the year was the assembly, which made itself felt in the field activity of the brothers in the month of August with an unprecedented increase of 12.5 percent in publishers. Many experiences were sent to the Society’s headquarters, and we are pleased to publish some very interesting and thought-provoking ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Greek-speaking congregation here in Brussels has an attendance at meetings that regularly exceeds by 30 to 40 percent the number of associated publishers. The overseer was asked how this was possible, and here is his reply:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“1. By applying progressively the counsel from the organisation concerning the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">interior</span><span class="font9"> ministry with a view to the elevation of the spiritual level of the whole congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“2. By appropriate talks and demonstrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“3. By having meetings which are really instructive, alive and edifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“4. By personal contact, the servants and other mature publishers’ making visits on brothers to lovingly examine together with them the problem preventing them from attending meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“5. Each Monday evening the servants and other mature publishers either visit or invite to their own home the new publishers and those not so mature in order to study </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and prepare for the meetings. This has worked very effectively because the bonds of Christian unity are strengthened, avoiding the tendency of staying isolated. We are logically and Scripturally convinced that meeting attendance is a part of our worship. What is the result of this attitude? One-hundred percent attendance at all the meetings of all the brothers and sisters. But how is it that the attendance is more than the number of publishers? It is simple. From the first contact, we invite the people to our meetings. Here we imitate the businessmen of this world who present their goods as attractively as possible so that the customers buy them. Our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘goods’</span><span class="font9"> are our meetings!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This experience shows what can be accomplished when one’s heart is set on being a pioneer. A not-too-young sister wished to become a vacation pioneer but she had a problem: her son, not in the truth, wanted a hot meal at midday and there had to be freshly cooked potatoes! The territory was composed of many villages and the bus timetable did not allow her to be home by midday, so she bought a bicycle. This caused a revolution in the family. They had never before seen the sister on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> bicycle and especially at fifty years of age! But this was the only way to be sure to be in time to serve her son’s midday meal. The sister continues: “The potato problem was solved as follows: I peeled them the night before, and in the morning I put them in a plastic bag, passed by my daughter’s home, and asked her to cook them. At midday, coming back from the service, I picked up the potatoes, all nice and hot, put them in the plastic bag and off on my cycle for the house. Fifteen minutes later we were at the table. Everything worked so well that the following month I renewed my vacation pioneer service. Then my son got married; the problem of the hot potatoes and other matters no longer existing, and remembering the joys that I had had in Jehovah’s service, I made the decision to serve Him full time, which I have done for the past two years!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are very happy to be serving Jehovah here in Belgium, and we hope during the 1967 service year to be well on the way with the construction of the new Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BOLIVIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,751,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 624 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 6,011</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Bolivia, a country high in the Andes mountains, had an increase of 5.6 percent in the number of Jehovah’s witnesses preaching the good news of the Kingdom during the past year. This has always been a very difficult territory to work, but during the past service year twenty missionaries worked hard to assist their brothers in gaining a better appreciation of the truth. They showed everyone who would listen the importance of not neglecting the house of their God. With these twenty missionaries there are thirty-one special pioneers working isolated cities and towns so that the good news of the Kingdom can be spread into all parts of the country. Jehovah’s witnesses in Bolivia are excited these days because the Society has decided to build a new branch home, Kingdom Hall and missionary living quarters in La Paz. The building plans for this structure have just been approved by the city. The branch servant has sent us a few experiences that you will find interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From one congregation servant we received the following report showing the necessity of living up to right standards: “An interested couple contacted by a missionary advanced rapidly, began attending meetings regularly and in six months eagerly attended their first assembly in La Paz. That was when they realized what their biggest obstacle was. Their marriage status was not correct, the woman still being legally married to another man. The correct procedure was explained to them, but they did not hurry to comply and so ceased to progress, although three of the four children in the family symbolized their dedication due to the continued study and attendance at meetings. Something had to be done, as these people were considered to be Jehovah’s witnesses; so the congregation committee told the couple that they would have to straighten out the matter, the woman getting a divorce and then legalizing their marriage or separating in order to stay in good standing in the congregation. The divorce was arranged, but they still did not legalize the marriage, so the committee advised them that it would have to be announced that they were persons not worthy of association with the New World society. Three years had gone by without anything being done to put their lives in harmony with Bible principles. Realizing the seriousness of their situation now, they arranged for the civil ceremony and are now happy to be on the road to everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A special pioneer writes showing the importance of always calling back when invited. He says: “One day when I was in the door-to-door work a lady invited me to return when her husband was home. I made a note to do so, and when I made the call the man invited me in and asked many questions concerning many Bible doctrines. For three hours and a half we consulted the Bible for answers to his questions about hellfire, the trinity, the soul, Christ’s return, and so forth. The next Saturday we made definite arrangements for a study, and now in less than a year this man has become a regular publisher. He studies with his family and is awaiting the next assembly to symbolize his dedication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 82,400,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 40,340&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,043</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With hearts full of thankfulness to Jehovah the witnesses of Jehovah in Brazil shared in another year of spiritual prosperity. Brazil is a large country and has plenty of territory that needs to be covered. There is a growing interest among the people of the country in the truth, and Jehovah’s witnesses are working hard to cultivate it. As a result, this past service year there were 4,076 persons who were baptized. These have taken up the great work along with their brothers of declaring the good news of the Kingdom. The brothers have had remarkable success with the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie,&quot;</span><span class="font10"> in the Portuguese language. The interest in the truth on the part of the public is most encouraging. There has been a fine increase in the distribution of bound books and booklets, new subscriptions obtained, individual magazines distributed, Bible studies conducted and in publishers sharing in the Kingdom service. Their new peak is 40,340 for the 1966 service year. Anticipation runs high, too, for the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly to be held in Brazil in January 1967, and they are expecting many visitors from other countries. This, too, will stimulate the brothers to continue giving the grand witness that Brazil is receiving right now. The experiences sent in by the branch servant are heartwarming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In July for the first time more than 2,000 shared in the vacation pioneer ministry. One eighty-one-year-old brother spent three months in this service, working more than a hundred hours each month. In April he placed 235 magazines. A seventy-five-year-old brother had never had success in the back-call and Bible study ministry, so he used a month as a vacation pioneer to improve in these fields. Mature brothers in the congregation made a special effort to help him, and he was able to reach all the goals, including eighty-two back-calls. By the end of the month he was conducting seven studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well-trained children continue to give a fine witness to the truth. An eight-year-old child, brought up in the discipline of Jehovah, was in a class with thirty-nine Catholic children. At Easter time the teacher, also a Catholic, assigned the class to write a composition on the celebration and what they expected to receive from the Easter rabbit. Our little Witness wrote on the pagan origin of the holiday and why she did not celebrate it. After the compositions were corrected, she had the highest mark in the class. The teacher later told the mother of the little girl that she was learning many things from her daughter. Another eight-year-old already has three years’ experience in accompanying her parents in the door-to-door ministry and now conducts four home Bible studies with other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> articles on the prodigal son were greatly appreciated by the brothers throughout the country and many say they used the information to help some of this kind to “come to their senses” and return to Jehovah’s family. A circuit servant and a congregation overseer visited a brother who had not associated with the congregation for years, but at first he showed no interest. Then they used </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">and explained the parable. This brother understood his own position and immediately got back to associating with the organization. One congregation reported that the article was used to help six persons who had drifted away return to activity and association. One who was helped by the use of the article expressed himself this way: “I give thanks to Jehovah for my return to his theocratic organization. The circuit servant and congregation overseer visited me and showed me what I was missing by not attending meetings. I began to study again and now I am firm in the truth.” A married couple related their return in these words: “What a joy! No criticism or comments, just happiness. From there on, nothing stopped us.” After reading the prodigal son articles, an isolated person who was formerly active in the truth immediately wrote the Society wanting to know what to do. He was sent the address of the nearest isolated group of publishers and encouraged to start studying again. At the same time the group was advised and a request made for someone to visit this man if possible. But before the publishers could do so the man was there to see them. Arrangements were made for regular visits to help this man and any others that were interested in learning the truth. After four months sixteen people were meeting regularly for study, three were active in the ministry and ten home Bible studies were being conducted with other interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible truths declared by Jehovah’s witnesses continue to attract many new ones. One of Jehovah’s witnesses moved next door to a home where a Catholic priest was conducting a weekly meeting with seven neighborhood women. Naturally, our sister talked to her neighbor about the Bible and what it taught. The neighbor began to see the difference between the true religion and false religion and to talk to her friends about what she was learning. Now the weekly meetings of the priest have stopped and five of the seven women are studying and associating with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In another city a professional man, visited in his office by a pioneer minister, said that he did not need anything from Jehovah’s witnesses for he was a member of the “priesthood,” as a member of the Mormon Church, but he invited the Witness to his house for a Bible discussion. When the Witness arrived, this man and two Mormon missionaries were waiting for him, and they discussed the Bible until 2 a.m. Two days later the man came to the home of the Witness wanting another visit, for he now had some doubts about what he had been taught by the Mormons. This time two different missionaries were there who were supposed to be better equipped to uphold Mormon doctrine. After another long discussion the meeting was adjourned until a third night. But this night no Mormon missionaries appeared. The man even went to a neighboring city to get other missionaries to come and defend the Mormon faith, but no one came. But it was already evident that there was no defense against the Scriptural truths presented by the Witness, so the man and his family now associate with Jehovah’s witnesses in studying the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;110,419</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 385 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 287</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The work that was done this past year on the east coast of Central America in the small country of British Honduras is encouraging. The ministers of God have pressed on diligently, putting more hours in the field service than the previous year. They have increased their bound-book distribution, they obtained more subscriptions to the magazines and distributed more individual copies. While there was no increase in the number of publishers, still the people in this country have had an opportunity to hear the truth as never before, and Jehovah’s witnesses will press on preaching the good news for the benefit of all those who have ears to hear. Here are a few interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I am studying with a young girl of sixteen years, who studies even after being discouraged from doing so. She studied for some time in her hometown and then came to the capital city to continue her schooling. I was asked to continue her study. After a time her mother visited her and told her she would have to quit the study, but the girl told her mother that she could stop her but she felt the truth was just what she wanted and she did not want any other religion. So after much persuasion, at a later date she was allowed to continue. Later, the man of the home where she was staying told her that the study could not continue at his house anymore, so I moved the study to the house of a brother close by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">School vacation came along and on returning she had more liberty. We continued the study, and she is progressing rapidly in the truth. She prepares for the home Bible study and all the meetings, has enrolled in the ministry school, preaches to schoolmates, goes in the service on weekends and is now starting a Bible study with someone else. Since it was mentioned that more magazines could be placed by offering them at all times on the street, she, along with a pioneer sister she stays with now, follows this suggestion while they are walking home from meetings, and they are having good results. She is contemplating baptism now and is looking forward to more service when she finishes school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many of our pioneers have good results in the Kingdom ministry by offering just the two magazines. Especially is this true during the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> subscription campaign and the special magazine months. A special pioneer and his wife had this experience to relate concerning the magazine campaign:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“During our campaign months of February through May of this year, my wife and I as special pioneers enjoyed a real treat in Kingdom service. We set out to reach certain goals by the end of the campaign, making definite plans, bearing in mind our little baby girl (under two years old). I had planned to obtain not less than 50 subscriptions and place 500 magazines for April. We worked hard with the congregation in its every activity, supporting the prestudy work, Magazine Day, and so forth, besides using every opportunity that presented itself for distributing magazines and obtaining subscriptions. By our determination and increased activity we were able to see our schedule and plans work out smoothly. For subscriptions, arrangements were made with several persons to obtain the money for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> subscriptions sometime later. This brought good success. It was necessary at times to make several calls before obtaining the amounts agreed upon. In some cases half payments were made on the first call and then the remainder would be given at a later date within the month. All this worked well, and by the end of the campaign my wife had obtained over 30 subscriptions and I got 102; for the month of April I placed 707 magazines and she placed 302.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH ISLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 54,435,700</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 50,599 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,076</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the year 1942 there were 12,318 regular publishers in the British Isles. In 1947 there were still 12,149 publishers. Seven years with no increase! In the next seventeen years Witnesses in the British Isles increased to 48,849, an increase of over 2,000 publishers each year, on the average. But in the last two years the British Isles increased by only 224 publishers. What has happened? Is it that the ears of the people in the British Isles are no longer hearing and their eyes are no longer seeing? Have the inhabitants stopped listening to the Word of God so that the people of that land “may not actually turn back and get healing for themselves”? While there has been an increase of only 224 publishers in the past two years, still there were 4,586 newly dedicated persons baptized. So there are some ears that are hearing and some eyes that are seeing. On the other hand, there must be some who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah and who were publishing the good news along with Jehovah’s witnesses but who are no longer heeding the Word of God. This is a very serious matter, and it is something for all of God’s people everywhere to consider so that they will not be falling away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The branch office through the circuit and district servants is doing everything possible to help those who have already come to a knowledge of the truth to continue walking in that truth and to appreciate the urgency of the times. There is no question about it, the brothers in the British Isles are working diligently preaching the good news of the Kingdom, and they accomplished much good during the past year. They had the highest number of home Bible studies ever conducted, namely, 36,793. What will the results be? Maybe we are nearer than some think to the time when not many more people will take a definite stand for God’s kingdom. But regardless of what happens, Jehovah’s witnesses in the British Isles and the rest of the world will continue trying to make people hear “until the cities actually crash in ruins.” Here are some very interesting experiences from the London office, which also looks after the work in Aden and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The problem highlighted in last year’s report, of many brothers falling away from the truth, is still with us. Jehovah’s “sheep” are still there and new ones are being found all the time, as shown in the more than two thousand baptized this year. But for each new one coming in another falls away and so little numerical increase is shown. We have been very grateful for the Society’s provision for the circuit servants to spend more time helping the weak and inactive ones, training the overseers also to do this fine work. Very good results are being seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One family of six fell away from the truth fourteen years ago. The father says: “I began drifting away about the time of the Korean war. There was a possibility of my being recalled for military service and I was afraid to face the issue. This problem became like a mountain in my mind. Over the years I have been continually visited by various brothers and sisters. Fifteen months ago the congregation servant persuaded me to start a study. Then he encouraged me to come along to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study. As a result, I have felt able to cope with my problems. One good thing that has come out of this is that my wife, who was not previously in the truth, is now coming along and also the children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It becomes increasingly evident that those who have known the truth can never really forget it. One young brother who had received early training stopped attending meetings on leaving school and had no contact with the brothers for thirteen years. By this time his life was in a turmoil, he was living apart from his wife, and his boy was being raised in another home as a foster child. In great distress he sought out the overseer of the congregation to ask many questions that were troubling him, and especially to find out if God would forgive him for many wrong things that he had done. The overseer was able to put his mind at rest with skilful use of scriptures such as Malachi 3:7. The young man for the first time began to feel there was hope, and has since attended all meetings. However, his domestic problems still worried him. He travelled a long way to meet his wife and succeeded in persuading her to resume their marriage, although she was not interested in the truth. Eventually, by listening in at his study, she also began to take part and is now baptized. Now the three of them are truly united and making good progress in the truth. Many similar examples have occurred this year of people who have left the truth for the world and who found it to be an unsatisfying sham. Some have been brought down as low as it is possible to get, just like the prodigal son, and then have just had to turn back to Jehovah. How happy we are to see them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is important to show warmth and friendliness to those we meet, as this is often remembered for a long time, with good results. A German woman married to an Englishman told this story: She was living in Berlin just after the war and was very ill and could not recover due to inadequate food and medical treatment. One day she was so depressed she took out a bottle of drugs and was about to end her life with an overdose when the doorbell rang insistently. A sister had called in house-to-house work. The woman tried to brush her off, but the sister, seeing her extreme distress, refused to leave her like that. The woman broke down and the sister took her inside the flat. Seeing the bottle on the table, the sister begged her not to end her life and gave her a witness about the new order. Finally, the sister prayed with her and thanked Jehovah for the opportunity of saving a life. That was almost twenty years ago, and the woman had no contact again with the Witnesses until this year. Her memory of this incident is still very fresh and now she is having a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Much fine work can be done if we are alert to take advantage of every opportunity, even under unusual circumstances. One young brother going home from work saw one of his workmates with a flat tire and stopped to help him. The next day during lunch hour when the workmate saw the young brother reading </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> he sat down and started to tear the truth to pieces. He was an ardent churchgoer and believed the trinity. He was given some magazines, and after a while the brother got him to come along to a public lecture. Gradually he started coming to the other meetings, although still attending church. Finally, he agreed to a Bible study and is now out in the field service. What a fine result from helping a man with a flat tire!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many of our sisters with unbelieving husbands can take hope from this experience: Mrs. D---- recognised</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the truth from the start, but when she told her husband, he ridiculed her, saying she was mad and would believe anything and anybody and if it had been the Salvation Army that called she would have believed them. Mrs. D--- continued to tell him what she was</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">learning, but it turned him farther away from the truth; so the brothers counselled her from 1 Peter chapter 3 on winning her husband without a word. Mrs. D---began to teach her young daughter and also</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">to go to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study, which displeased her husband greatly, since they had been accustomed to go for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> walk on Sunday afternoon. Her husband put all sorts of opposition in her way, taking the daughter to the Methodist Church to keep her away from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study. He even wrote a letter to the sisters telling them not to call on his wife again. Then Mrs. D--- became seriously ill and was in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> hospital</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">for six months, during which time a great deal of love was shown by the sister helping her, who called several times each week. On leaving the hospital she was baptized. Later, when one of the sisters called on her at home, her husband was present and asked a Bible question. When asked what stirred his interest he admitted it was the love shown to his wife while in the hospital. He had started taking a discreet look into </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> checking the scriptures in his own Bible. Today Brother D &nbsp;is a servant in the congregation and his young daughter is a pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Good progress has been made this year in home Bible study work and much of this is due to brothers’ making the direct approach in house-to-house work. One young brother who started vacation pioneering straight from school had difficulty in obtaining a Bible study and thus meeting the requirements for regular pioneer service. The circuit servant encouraged him to try the direct approach, and now he has six studies making fine progress. When the Society’s film was shown recently in his congregation, seven people who attend these studies were present. The young brother is now a regular pioneer and enjoying a productive ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ADEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;220,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 24,444</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A small band of faithful brothers and sisters have kept the truth alive in Aden throughout the year in spite of difficulties due to the tense political situation and much dangerous terrorist activity, which prevents them from moving around freely. This has hindered the Kingdom service, but they have kept their studies going and have met together regularly for their spiritual needs. We were happy that the circuit servant was able to visit them twice during the year, and they appreciated his upbuilding help and encouragement. He mentioned that a good number of the group are children and it was very stimulating to see what an active part they take in all the meetings. The brother in charge of the group’s activities was able to get to Britain during the summer and enjoyed the association with the brothers. He came into the truth in Aden and has been isolated there during the past nine years. During his stay in England he attended a Kingdom Hall meeting for only the second time in his life and also attended his very first assembly. We certainly appreciate the efforts our isolated brothers put forth to stay strong and to share in the final witness to the extent that they are able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MALTA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;330,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 11,786</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is good to report that Malta is still making fine progress in the ministry and Jehovah’s “sheep” are being found and fed. One of the special pioneers started a study with a very interested Maltese woman. As a result of the study she eventually stopped attending church and mass and her neighbours grew cold toward her. They knew the priest would be calling to reprimand her and were waiting to see what would happen. In anticipation of the priest’s visit the pioneer prepared her for the questions she might expect. When the priest called he asked her why she had not been to mass. She replied that if he could prove to her from the Bible that she should attend, she would go. He could not do this, of course, and evaded the point. The interested woman showed him Matthew 18:20 and other scriptures, after which he left to visit others in the street. The neighbours asked him about his visit and he said he had found her to have a good knowledge of the Bible and a deep love for God. This surprised them, as they had expected quite a different outcome. As a result, the neighbours are now calling on her to ask for answers to their Bible questions, and this has made her very happy. A little while ago she was baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BURMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 24,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 252 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">1 </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to 95,238</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many hardships have befallen our brothers in Burma, and it was during the last year that the government ordered all our foreign missionaries to leave the country. Despite this, Jehovah’s witnesses in Burma have forged ahead. The brothers there have in mind the words of Moses at Deuteronomy 31:7, 8: “Be courageous and strong . . . Jehovah is the one marching before you. He himself will continue with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely.” Even though seventeen brothers left the country during the past service year, the brothers in Burma were able to increase their average number of publishers by two. This made Jehovah’s people in Burma very glad. Though the missionaries had to leave, the brothers in Burma devoted more hours to the preaching of the good news than at any time heretofore. In fact, they put in 102,893 hours witnessing. Here are some interesting reports that the local branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following shows how important it is to leave the Society’s publications wherever possible. One day a young hospitalized soldier, who had often prayed to God for understanding of the Bible, saw a fellow sufferer reading two Bible study books, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained, </span><span class="font9">in Burmese. At once the soldier became absorbed in reading these wonderful books. Expecting soon to be transferred, he wanted to borrow the books and take them with him, but the owner, being himself interested, refused to loan them. In desperation the soldier got ahold of some paper, and, weak though he was, worked almost day and night to copy down by hand the material in those two books. He was actually halfway through the job when a pioneer arrived at the hospital and the now thoroughly interested “sheep” was able to secure the precious books for himself. Thereafter, although he could sit up only with difficulty, he attended several meetings at the local Kingdom Hall and became absolutely convinced that Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth. He determined to dedicate his life to Jehovah and arrange his affairs to enter the pioneer service as soon as possible. But how, since he was still in the army?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Arriving back at his unit still in a weak condition, he requested a discharge on medical grounds and told his superior officer that henceforth he wanted to serve his God Jehovah full time. The answer? An offer of promotion! But he continued to plead his case, at the same time calling on God in prayer. Finally, he became so frantic that he burst into tears before the examining officer. The latter then recognized the soldier’s sincerity, and finally the day of his release arrived. Before long the former soldier was baptized at a circuit assembly, and now he is a zealous vacation pioneer serving among his own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some respond readily to an invitation to share in the field service, as the following experience shows. One day when a missionary introduced his message at the door the man at once invited the brother in and asked many questions. Some of the questions he asked were, “How can a loving God persecute people forever in hell?”, “How can one keep living after death?” and many other intelligent questions. When all his questions were answered from the Bible, he was quite satisfied and happy. Being an alert Witness, the brother invited him for the public talk to be held that evening. The man and his wife both came for the talk and also stayed for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study. After the meetings they stayed to ask some more questions. The brother told them about the importance of the door-to-door ministry. The very next week they joined the brother in the service. This couple were baptized during a circuit assembly. Now this new brother and sister and one of their daughters are very zealous publishers. It is all because of a brother who did not wait very long to invite them to the meetings and to join in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some publishers hesitate to talk to leaders of Christendom’s churches. But the following shows how wrong this attitude is. An earnest Baptist youth leader was met by a pioneer in the door-to-door work. At the time the man was busy arranging for a baptism service, and so was unable to spare the time to hear more of our message. But hearing the ring of truth in the little he heard, he arranged for us to give a talk in the church, as he wanted his church members to listen to the message. But the truth was not appreciated as much as he thought it would be by the rest of the members. This man and his family began to study the Bible, and one month later the pioneer told him about the district assembly to be held in a city 520 miles away. The man expressed his wish to attend the assembly to see how it would be operated. All the way to the assembly the pioneers spoke about the truth to him, so much so that the man saw the importance of leaving Babylon the Great, and he was baptized. Still he was not satisfied with the minimum service he had to do, as he was working, so he made plans to leave his job and pioneer. He is one of the happiest pioneers we have here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMEROONS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,087,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8,181 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 500</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses in the Camerouns moves ahead peacefully and very steadily. A number of new congregations have been established in various parts of the country, seventeen in fact. By continually stressing the need of the brothers not to forsake the house of their God, the publishers of the Kingdom appreciate the importance of living as Christians all day long. This is not easy when one considers the pressures that are brought against the brothers by families, neighbors and local customs that try to force them to remain a part of the present system of things. The branch office located in Douala looks after the work not only in the Camerouns but also in Tchad. Here are some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">En route to make return visits on interested persons, a special pioneer was stopped by a man sitting outside his house. “Where are you going in such a hurry?” asked the man. “I have some good news that I am taking to someone who wishes to hear it,” replied the pioneer. “Well,” said the man, “am I not entitled to hear it also? Come, tell me about it.” The pioneer agreed, and the man called his wife and two children to listen. After presenting a sermon on the subject “God’s Promise of a New System of Things,” real interest was shown by the whole family. This couple had just lost a teen-age daughter, and they were very happy to learn the Bible hope of a resurrection. After several Bible studies were held, the wife said to the pioneer: “I thank Jehovah for his goodness because the truth has made a big change in this house. My husband shows me much consideration now; he no longer beats me but spends time associating with me. Even the children have changed; they have become honest and obedient. I, too, have understood my place in the home as a wife and homemaker.” The children explained further to the pioneer, saying: “Sir, since you helped us consider the scripture at Colossians 3:18-21, our parents do not fight anymore. They are showing us affection and are teaching us good things. We are now obeying them and we are all very happy.” All the members of this family are attending congregation meetings and looking forward to sharing in the spreading of the “good news” to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This year over 94,000 persons viewed the Society’s educational films. In one village, the film showing was announced to everyone. Imagine seeing Catholic nuns going from door to door to talk to the people. However, they were not preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. They were warning the “faithful” not to attend the showing of the film by Jehovah’s witnesses. But what a surprise! Practically the whole village was on hand for the start of the film showing. After it became completely dark, many Catholics who had been watching from their windows came over to the assembly grounds to see and hear better. Even the local priest was watching the film from his open window. During the presentation of the film there was repeated applause, and many persons did not want to leave when it was over. The attitude of many persons has changed. Doors formerly closed to the Witnesses are now opened for eager Bible discussions. Many who saw the film are now discussing the Bible at every opportunity. What </span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font9"> powerful witness has been given by these enlightening film presentations!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The difference between Christendom’s missionaries and the Bible kind of missionary was highlighted when a European district servant and his wife visited a town in the interior of the country. Some local people had been taunting Jehovah’s witnesses in that town saying that, since no white people are Jehovah’s witnesses, their religion must be insignificant. When our white brothers visited the people at their homes they were well received. The local citizens marvelled when they saw these missionaries eat, drink and live among their African brothers. They had never seen</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">white people live among them like that before. This moved one man to declare: “They really live like the apostles did. What a difference from the way our priests and ministers live!” The local overseer reports that, because of the visit and the work accomplished, there are many Bible studies being conducted in the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Demons have a real grip on many people. Those who dabble in spiritism and demonism are greatly feared by the people. On one occasion a large crowd was following </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a man who</span><span class="font9"> had a “talking serpent.” The serpent gave greetings and spoke in foreign tongues. The man took his serpent into the home of a rich man to perform in front of him. A brother was passing by and, attracted by the commotion, he went to the house to see what was happening. As soon as he entered the room, the serpent stopped talking. The man cried out: “A magician has entered this room; he had better leave or I will bring evil upon him.” The brother asked the man: “Is that a serpent or a demon that has spoken?” “Who are you?” replied the man. “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses and I know that since God created animals not one serpent has spoken, with the exception of the one at the beginning, in the garden of Eden, who, under the inspiration of Satan the Devil, led Adam and Eve into sinning against God. Therefore, I believe that what you hear speaking is a demon and not the serpent.” Offended, and seeing that the serpent kept silent, the man left the building. Later, the brother met the man again and this time he was anxious to have some publications of the Society. Now he regularly reads the Society’s publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TCHAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 150,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses from surrounding countries have held secular employment in Fort Lamy, the capital of Tchad, for several years. A congregation of “strangers” was formed. Imagine the joy of the brothers when a well-to-do and well-respected native Tchadian responded to their preaching by accepting the “good news.” The circuit servant happily reports this experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Mr. T----wrote a letter to the congregation explain</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ing that October 10, 1965, was a happy day for him. It was then that he listened to a Bible sermon presented by two Witnesses calling at his home. Having the Bible all this time but not knowing the treasure he possessed was, as he expressed it, ‘like a poor man sleeping on a bag full of gold.’ He immediately began studying the Bible twice a week with the help of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Make Sure of All Things’</span><span class="font9"> and other Bible helps. He came to meet me at the airport when I visited the congregation in January and then spent the entire week with us in the field ministry. So great was his joy in the field service that he offered to drive me in his own car to the next congregation I was scheduled to visit over 150 miles away. He stayed with us that evening and reluctantly returned to Fort Lamy the following day.” He has since then been baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 19,399,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 41,042 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 473</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The progress of the preaching activity in Canada during the 1966 service year could be described as steady. They actually had 261 more regular publishers in the field than during the previous year. Jehovah’s witnesses conducted more Bible studies in the homes of the people this year than previously, but the big question many of the brothers in Canada are asking themselves is, Have all of those who have dedicated their lives to Jehovah been building on the right foundation with fire-resistant materials? We know that each one must do so if he is going to stay in the truth and gain God’s favor of life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The big event in Canada this year was the marvelous series of conventions. The brothers were truly blessed and thrilled with their “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies. The publicity given these assemblies from coast to coast was remarkable. Outstanding was the nationwide television network of forty-seven stations affiliated with the Canadian Broadcasting Company that carried an excellent program about Jehovah’s witnesses across Canada. There was also another television network with eleven affiliated stations that put on a halfhour program about Jehovah’s witnesses. So the Canadian public through the medium of television certainly learned something about the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is expected that during this new service year the work will accelerate, but this depends a lot on the hearts and minds of the people and whether they are part or not of the “great crowd” that will be gathered out of “Babylon the great” before the end of this system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus said: “I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me.” (John 10:14) The truthfulness of this was dramatically illustrated by the experience of a former school principal in western Canada. She had been instrumental in converting several people to Roman Catholicism and was widely known for her zeal and devotion in that religion. Several of her immediate family are serving as priests and nuns. Desiring to do an even better job of converting others to what she thought was the true faith, she asked a priest for a textbook on tradition. Why this unusual request? She had heard the clergy say so much about tradition that she just had to have a textbook on it so she could teach others the Catholic faith. When no book was made available to her, she determined that the next best thing was to read the Bible from Genesis onward. When she got as far as Matthew 15:6—“you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition”—she was horrified. Doubts began to enter her mind and she began searching farther. Just at this time she was contacted by a special pioneer sister. Her alert mind quickly grasped the truth. She read all she could lay her hands on, often rising at 6 a.m. to study for several hours in the morning. Two priests came out to inform her that the church had done away with some of its traditions and to get her to come back to church. Out came her Bible and she read Matthew 15:6 to them. After a lively discussion, the priests left, saying that next time they would bring a priest with them who believed the Bible. To this the lady quickly retorted, “Don’t you?” She has succeeded in interesting one of her brothers who has spent almost nine years in a seminary. He postponed taking his final vows for the priesthood in order to investigate matters carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How highly does this truth seeker regard the truth? This is how she expresses herself: “I feel as though I’ve been cheated in the past. I thought a university education would satisfy my longing, but I could see that it would eventually destroy my faith in God. But this, the truth, is what I’ve been looking for. I’ve been hungering for this all my life!” This former Catholic zealot is now a zealous publisher of the good news and is sharing the truth with some of those she herself once converted to Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The opportunities for preaching the truth are limitless. One day a census taker came to the home of one of our Christian sisters. The householder took advantage of this fine opportunity for incidental witnessing and described the blessings of God’s righteous new order. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font9"> books were placed, along with two magazines. She was very happy to learn of the wonderful promises contained in the Bible. Three weeks later this census taker returned to the sister’s home, letting her know that both she and her daughter had enjoyed the magazines. Would she like to have a subscription? Why, yes, she willingly subscribed for both </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> Before leaving, this lady census taker spied the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book and asked if she might have a copy. Because of her interest, the householder asked her: “Would you like to have a home Bible study?” Her reply: “I’d just love that!” So incidental witnessing continues to play a part in our Christian ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One sister in western Canada was told by her doctor that she was anemic and this concerned her very much. However, she responded to encouragement to pioneer in April. How did her health stand up? When she went to see her doctor at the end of the month, he was simply amazed at her improvement in health and asked what she had been doing for herself. The sister attributes it to the joy and contentment of the vacation pioneer ministry and the fresh air and exercise that she had during the time of her vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 836 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,800,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,153</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in the Central African Republic have made good progress during the past year. They enjoyed a 9-percent increase in publishers and reached a new all-time peak in the number of those sharing in the Kingdom work. Their home Bible studies have greatly increased, many have learned to read and write, and, as a result, their ministry is much more effective in the country. Now for the first time all the brothers can participate in the written reviews that will begin in the month of November 1966. Another thing that brought great joy to the brothers was the new branch home that was completed during the year. Jehovah’s witnesses are appreciative of this. Here are some experiences as reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In May the Evangelical Mission wrote a letter to the president of the republic asking him to ban Jehovah’s witnesses, because, according to them, Jehovah’s witnesses are against the government. To add weight to their letter they sent along a copy of their church magazine, which contained an article attacking Jehovah’s witnesses. Apparently they expected the president to read the letter and the magazine and then quietly take action against us, and that would be the end of our Christian work here. But great was their consternation when the president produced the letter and the magazine during the next meeting held by the Council of Ministers. After thorough discussion of the matter, the government strongly rebuked the Evangelical Mission for stirring up hate among the people. On top of the chastisement given to the Mission, the government also decided to ban their church magazine, which had falsely accused Jehovah's witnesses. The next day and for a week thereafter announcement was made over the government radio station several times a day in five different languages to the effect that the church magazine was banned in the country and that the president was very angry with the Mission because of its hate campaign. This gave us very favorable publicity throughout the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A zealous teen-age publisher who is an invalid in a wheelchair devised an ingenious method to explain the Bible to the neighborhood children. First of all, he carefully traced on ordinary paper the first few pictures from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book. Then he cut out some of the lines here and there. Next he cut two holes out of a square tin box, one hole on either side. Then with a flashlight he was ready to explain the Bible pictures with “lantern” slides. One evening each week the children are invited. Then as he moves the pictures up in front of the flashlight a remarkably clear picture is produced on the wall of the house. As the picture moves on, he explains the Bible account that the picture represents. Every week he adds a few more pictures. The children in the neighborhood and some adults also look forward to this weekly Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CEYLON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 11,750,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 269 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 43,680</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are many problems to overcome when one of Jehovah’s witnesses goes from house to house. People want everyone to speak of “our nation,” “our culture,” “our languages,” “our ancient religions.” So a minister of God’s kingdom must truly be alert in order to arouse the listener’s interest in the Bible. This interest is being aroused in Ceylon in both the Sinhalese and Tamil languages, the principal languages of the country. The overseers of the congregations must be alert to help the publishers give a good Scriptural answer to questions raised in field service. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible has been complete in Tamil for over a century, but most Tamil people are Hindus. At a circuit assembly answers given by a new Witness gave me much joy. I must tell you the questions and the answers. “What was your attitude to the Bible before you met the Witnesses?” “I was a Hindu and followed the Hindu rites and customs and did not have any knowledge of the Bible.” “What rites and practices did you perform as a Hindu?” “My faith in Hinduism was so strong that I built a shrine in my own home for the gods I worshiped. I even made a vow to grow my beard, and kept this for five years. I put much sacred ash on my forehead and practiced mantra.” “How did the Bible help you?” “It helped me to learn that there is only one true God, Jehovah, whom I should worship and how he dislikes image worship. So I broke my gods and shrine to pieces. Next I shaved off my beard, which I considered so important, stopped using sacred ash and put aside all use of the magic of mantra. One day the overseer showed me from the Bible that it is wrong to have a wife without legalizing the marriage. So I gave notice of marriage and fourteen days later the one who had been my wife for twenty-five years became such legally. The Bible has helped me in dedicating my life to this great God and symbolizing this by water immersion. I know only Tamil and am very grateful to have the Bible and aids to study it in this language. The past five months, the happiest in my life, I've spent in the vacation pioneer ministry. How much the Bible has done for me!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some territory is not as appealing as other territory. Still it can be good, as this sister experienced. “The importance of having a positive attitude and being willing to work in any territory assigned was brought home to me when our congregation arranged to work the business area. One day I was asked to work alone in a bazaar section, where the shops were small and not at all clean and attractive. However, I was prepared with magazines in all the necessary languages and thought I would at least try to see how it would be. Most were friendly, listened to my brief presentation and obtained magazines. After two and a half hours I had to stop because my supply of magazines was finished. I had placed sixty-nine and obtained five subscriptions. My recommendation is to work bazaars too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After marrying and becoming inactive for a number of years in isolated places, a brother was surprised to get a warm letter from an overseer inviting him to attend the coming district assembly. “My conscience was troubling me and I was wanting to associate again. And I can’t get over how I received this letter just when I did,” he remarked. Attend the assembly he did, with his wife and children. How impressed they were! Arrangements were made for the circuit servant and other brothers to visit them on a distant coconut estate. Not only did he soon become an active minister again, but his wife also started in the ministry. They taught their children the Bible and to sing some of the Kingdom songs. Realizing the disadvantage of being so far out, he decided to risk giving up his job to move where there is a congregation. Though it is a problem to find work, he soon found a job and now the family makes fine progress. A letter to inactive ones can do much good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CHILE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,112 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,116</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This has been a very satisfying year for Jehovah’s witnesses in Chile because many blessings were experienced, both individually and collectively. An excellent proclamation of the Kingdom message was given and it resulted in a 12-percent increase in the proclaimers of the good news of the Kingdom. There was a fine increase in the number of vacation pioneers, and the branch servant reports that 15 percent of the publishers were able to arrange their affairs so as to share in the vacation pioneer activity. This meant starting many new Bible studies, which increased from 3,917 to 4,338. So the brothers there have cause for rejoicing and they are now looking forward to seeing many visitors <a name="bookmark153"></a><a name="bookmark154"></a>during their January 1967 convention. Here are a few very interesting experiences that the branch servant in Chile submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society’s films still are a marvelous way to add to Jehovah’s praise and to encourage others to get out of “Babylon.” A special pioneer sister was assigned to work in a small town, and six months later the film was shown there. The small group of six publishers worked hard to advertise the film to be shown in the local theater. Several signs were posted in the business places, radio spot announcements were made, the two newspapers published announcements and many handbills were distributed. In order to obtain sound equipment the district servant explained the nature of the film to a young man who rented it out, and asked how much it would cost. The answer was, “This film is just what I need, so the cost will be one of those </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> books.” He himself installed his best equipment and then went home to bring his family to the film. Imagine the happiness of this small group of publishers to see the theater completely filled with 800 persons in attendance! Many favorable comments were received, and a fine witness was given. To close the year, there are now eleven publishers reporting there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Children, too, can add their praise to Jehovah. In one congregation arrangements are made every Monday afternoon to teach a small group to read and write, using the Society’s booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Learn to Read and Write.</span><span class="font9"> A young child of six years attended regularly, so he soon learned to read and write. When he entered school the following year he was one of the best students in the class. When the teacher realized this, she assigned him to help others who were having difficulty. The youngster decided he would use the same publication with which he had learned, and so he began his classes. When the teacher realized what he was doing, she asked to see the booklet and, after leafing through it, returned it to him with her approval to continue his classes with it. At the end of the term several of his schoolmates not only had improved in their scholastic ability but also had learned a good deal about God’s Word and about his wonderful works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This brief report would not be complete, Brother Knorr, without mentioning how much the brothers appreciate the new book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font9"> One congregation overseer wrote: “The new book was cause for great rejoicing in view of the wise manner in which it is written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Especially the introductory chapter on ‘God Lives! How We Know It,’ will be a powerful instrument to use against the wave of indifference and incredulity being unleashed in our day.” In the eight months since we have had the book the Branch has shipped out more than we did in any one year with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book, and the orders continue to come in. What a wonderful aid it is going to be as we continue to tell about Jehovah’s wonderful works!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">COLOMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 17,482,420</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,002 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,368</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our brothers in Colombia have had plenty to do in the work of Jehovah and they know that their labors are not in vain in connection with the Lord. (1 Cor. 15:58) It has been our pleasure to enroll more special pioneers in Colombia this past year and there is room for still more, as the ratio of publishers to the population shows in the above figure. The witnesses of Jehovah who are in the land are certainly working diligently, and they spent more time in the field service this year than at any time heretofore. The political climate has been very favorable for the expansion of our work. There has been no real opposition during the year from the clerical element. This may be due to the fact that the Catholic church has had its hands full with its own internal problems, because the political element of the country is pressing for divorce and a revision in church policy. Fine circuit assemblies have been held in Medellin and other cities, with no difficulties. Here are a few experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Upon first arriving in my assignment I could just say, “How are you?” and a few other poorly pronounced words in Spanish. On weekends during my language training I would read my magazine presentation from a small piece of paper, and a few times I had to have the person at the door help me with the pronunciation by his reading from my paper. It was during this stage that I placed two magazines with a lady who operated a small restaurant. I noted that she said: “I like to read these magazines.” However, upon my returning she was always out or extremely busy, but once took more magazines. Finally, a few months later, she had time to talk. By now I could converse more and found she was interested very much in the Bible, so I placed an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book with her and arranged a home Bible study. Although she gets up before five o’clock in the morning and works until after ten at night, seven days a week, she consented to study during a lull period at eight o’clock at night so her two daughters could participate. After a few months of study, she arranged it so that she and her daughters could attend meetings, having one stay at the restaurant. She recently stated: “I can see that I want to change my religion for the sake of my children.” I counted and found that I have three other studies that were readers of the magazines and literature and maintained interest for the needed time until I could understand and speak enough to study with them. Jehovah’s witnesses’ use of magazines and literature is a practical way to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Have you ever had a study with someone who showed very good interest and was just beginning to accompany you in the preaching work when she suddenly moved away, a good way out in the country where there is no regular mail service? It happened to me. The lady was very interested and had four small children, two of whom could read, and all four attended the study and took part. However, if I traveled to her home to continue studying with her, the trip would take me over three and a half hours by bus and walking. Would it be worth it or could that travel time not be better spent calling on other people closer to my home? I decided to make the effort to continue the study with her and her family and to help her continue the preaching work in the country around her home, as this section had never received a witness. Nine months have gone by and I can express my happiness at making the continued effort to call on this lady, for she herself is now conducting four home Bible studies in her new neighborhood and had the joy of having one of these attend our latest circuit assembly with her. I am very thankful to Jehovah and his organization for helping us to realize that it is not just one’s own time that is important, for I could not possibly have helped five families to come to Jehovah’s house to worship in those three and a half hours of travel, yet, as a result, five families are being so aided. Truly our “labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO REPUBLIC (BRAZZAVILLE)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,153 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;950,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 824</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is really good to see how our brothers in Africa try to put into operation the same kind of organization that their fellow workers have used around the world. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Congo Republic are not great in number, but they do appreciate the privilege of assembling together, and all the more so as the day draws near for the end of this system of things. Jehovah’s witnesses had a very happy time organizing their assembly, and the branch servant gives us a very interesting report on what took place in the Congo Republic and in the Republic of Gabon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The highlight of our year was the four-day “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly held July 14 to 17. This was the finest assembly ever held by Jehovah’s witnesses in the Congo. It was outstanding in organisation and discipline and most edifying and strengthening to all. The attendance was constant throughout the four days, reaching a peak of 946 on Sunday. Twenty-two persons symbolized their dedication. Brothers were grateful to Jehovah for the very fine program provided by means of his organisation—truly “a banquet of well-oiled dishes.”—Isa. 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What greatly contributed to the success of our assembly was a special preconvention talk delivered to the units in the assembly city. This served not only to stimulate and instruct the brothers, but also to help them see their privilege of volunteering their services. After the convention </span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font9"> congregation servant wrote the Branch: “Long before July 14 almost all of us had doubts about having a cafeteria. We thought we would be unable to serve our brothers, something already having been observed in previous smaller assemblies due to lack of organisation and brothers’ failing to accept their responsibilities. We recognize before Jehovah and our brothers that this change has come about owing to the talks organized by the Branch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To be able to overcome prejudice and place literature with religiously strong persons requires much tact. One of our circuit servants relates his own successful experience in just such a situation. “One morning while engaging in the house-to-house activity I greeted a young man, stated my reason for calling, and began to open my Bible to give him the sermon when I was confronted with the blunt objection: ‘What God are you preaching?’ ‘God, the Creator of everything,’ was my reply. ‘Well, then, what religion are you?’ he questioned. In answer I said: ‘The Christian religion of the Bible.’ </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘I</span><span class="font9"> am already a Christian, a Catholic one,’ came the quick, definite reply. ‘That is sufficient for me. I do not need or want to change.’ Trying to reason with him, I explained: ‘The purpose of our ministry is to teach the religion of the Bible. As you know, politicians talk about politics, businessmen about commerce, so isn’t it reasonable that Christians, regardless of their religion, should talk about the Word of God?’ By this he was convinced. ‘Perhaps you are right. Go ahead and talk.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“After having given my complete sermon I presented </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> He hesitated, saying: ‘I listened to you; but we are forbidden to read magazines not of our religion.’ Still reasoning with him, I replied: ‘Magazines that Christians should avoid are those which expound magic and evil works. Our magazine is entirely Christian and Biblical.’ When I drew his attention to a specific article, 'The Christian Ministry,’ he exclaimed: ‘What is this? Do all Christians have a ministry?’ My last point of reason was: ‘You cannot confuse a nurse with a mason, can you, nor a businessman with an administrator, because each name or title corresponds with a work or service? So it is the same with a Christian. If you read our journal you will understand that our ministry and publications are truly Christian.’ With the prejudice tactfully overcome, he took the magazine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF GABON Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 101 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,941</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even new ones in the truth can be firm in obeying God’s Word. After a Witness had conducted a Bible study with an interested young man only three months, he acquired sufficient knowledge to appreciate the sanctity of blood well enough to respect God’s commands on its use. As he was an electrician, he was installing electric wiring in a high ceiling. Losing his footing, he fell and was severely hurt. He was rushed to the hospital and, seeing that he had lost much blood, the doctor ordered a blood transfusion, or “otherwise,” as the doctor warned, “you will die in a few hours.” Conscious of the divine law, this truth lover simply said: “Let it be, if that is the case. Jehovah, the God that I worship, will resurrect me, should I die. I refuse.” His employer, liking him very much, tried with tears to intimidate him into accepting the transfusion, but this was not possible. His faith remained solid. The doctor, so as to be relieved of any responsibility, made him sign a paper attesting his refusal. Meanwhile, this doctor himself began explaining to the man’s employer some experiences with Jehovah’s witnesses relating to their firmness in observing God’s law on blood. For three days the doctor gave little attention to his patient. On the fourth day he amputated the badly damaged leg. Despite this, the man’s faith remained ever strong. To the joy of the local brothers, both he and his wife were recently baptized and wait happily for the fulfillment of the divine promise at 2 Peter 3:13. What fine endurance and respect for God’s laws! He not only preserved his present life longer than a few hours but has a prospect of future life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A congregation servant, despite his working in fulltime secular work, was privileged to vacation pioneer in April. Expressing his appreciation for this, he wrote how he was able to do it: “As long as we do not ‘neglect the house of our God’ our joy will always overflow. During this period of pioneer activity I have done what I had never done before. What was that? Well, from the time I became a publisher I had never engaged in service in the evening before the service meeting. While vacation pioneering I left my secular employment at five o’clock and went directly into the field service, presenting the magazines all along the way as I walked to the Kingdom Hall. In those fifty-five minutes I placed nine magazines. I was indeed happy to have used my time wisely to Jehovah’s praise and to have made an effort to attain my goal of hours despite my secular work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another vacation pioneer in the same congregation, the assistant congregation servant, also working full time in secular employment, tells us: “I preached all alone—I had never done that before. I easily attained 102 hours in service without being tired, something unbelievable before vacation pioneering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGO KINSHASA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 13,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,958 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,182</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in this part of Africa are very happy, and they have good reason to be. They have been waiting for something since 1932, and that was recognition by the government that Jehovah’s witnesses were free to preach the good news of the Kingdom. On June 9, 1966, the President of the Congo Democratic Republic signed an ordinance granting Jehovah’s witnesses legal recognition. This now gives God’s servants there the liberty to preach publicly, to meet together freely, to own property in the name of the Association and to carry on their work. For this we give all praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It certainly has been a long struggle, for during 1932 the Society requested the Belgian Colonial authorities to permit missionaries to enter the Congo. Much opposition was manifested at that time, especially on the part of the clergy. Five years ago we were able to get some missionaries in there, and since then the work has moved ahead very rapidly, until today we have a new peak of 5,958 publishers, with an average of 4,777 publishers working every month throughout the year in the Congo. More than one million hours were spent preaching the good news this year, but let us hear the branch servant tell a little more about the progress of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since 1958, after having made a serious and thorough investigation, the Colonial authorities realized the serious error they had made in letting themselves be deceived to the point of believing that Jehovah’s witnesses were responsible in one way or another for the forming of native religions that are looked upon as illegal societies. As a result of this investigation, in 1958 a decree of tolerance was promulgated, permitting Jehovah’s witnesses in the large cities to meet together freely, but the situation remained very difficult in several regions. Since this time, Jehovah has not stopped blessing his people here abundantly. Even though only tolerated at the time, Jehovah’s witnesses had the privilege of receiving literature, missionaries were permitted to enter the country, a branch was established and two missionary homes were opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses of the Congo deeply appreciate the privilege that they now enjoy because of the legal recognition of their activities. With all their heart they thank Jehovah and also express their gratitude to the governmental authorities for making this possible. As a direct consequence of this new legal position of Jehovah’s witnesses it was possible to organize a series of circuit assemblies where all the brothers and sisters were invited. Only one assembly could not be held; however, a total of eleven assemblies were held, with a total attendance of 11,214 for the public talks, and 24,039 for the showing of one of the Society’s films. Four hundred and sixty-five persons were baptized at these assemblies. It is not difficult to guess the reaction of the religious leaders to the organization of these assemblies and the legal recognition of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At one place where a circuit assembly was arranged, the ecclesiastical authorities went as far as to ask the mayor: “Who gave you the authority to permit Jehovah’s witnesses to hold their assembly?” Because he did not let himself be intimidated, they sent young men to the assembly grounds evidently with the idea of disturbing the program by yelling and loudly playing their portable radios. As this was not too successful, they began to play football in order to upset those who attended the assembly. The next day a projection of one of the Society’s films was to take place on the same grounds, so the brothers quickly built a temporary enclosure and placed themselves all around it in order to prevent the disturbers from annoying the ones in attendance. A large crowd came to the film showing and so did many would-be disturbers, but the film itself gave an excellent witness. There were no disturbances, but between each reel the crowd numbering several thousands shouted, “Long live Jehovah’s witnesses!” As in the case of Haman, the enemies were caught in their own trap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">COSTA RICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,433,058</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,665 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 538</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For many years the growth of Jehovah’s witnesses in Costa Rica was steady, running around 8 or 9 percent. But when we reached 1963 the average number of publishers stood at 2,656, and we have not passed that figure since. The publishers have stayed just the same. This is true even though a greater witness has been given each year, as shown by the number of hours spent in the field service, and 1966 showed the greatest number of hours spent preaching the good news in Costa Rica. It appears that people have ears to hear but they will not hear, and they have eyes with which to see, but they refuse to see. Regardless of this, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to preach to all and hope that some with a sheeplike disposition will listen to the message. It is true that many who formerly associated with the organization have failed to stick to the course of Christian integrity, and they have fallen away. At the same time new ones have entered the work and taken their place. During the past year 104 persons were baptized. They are looking forward to this winter when all the brothers in Costa Rica will enjoy an international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in San Jose. Here are some of the experiences that the branch servant reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In parts of the country there is a great deal of prejudice and fanaticism. In November 1965 three special pioneers were assigned to a town where there were no Witnesses. As soon as the agents of Babylon the Great found out that the pioneers were in the territory, they began a campaign of putting signs in the windows of the people living in the neighborhood that said: “We are Catholics. We do not permit Protestant propaganda.” The pioneers did not let this discourage them in their preaching work, and gradually the prejudice decreased. Now thirty home Bible studies are being conducted in homes where these signs were displayed. In less than one year three publishers have reported time in the service, and during the visit of the circuit servant another couple arranged their marital affairs so as to be admitted into the organization. As a result of the perseverance of these pioneers, the majority of the people now listen attentively to the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many fine experiences may be enjoyed as a result of taking up the vacation pioneer work. One brother responded to the invitation in April and called on a woman who had previously shown opposition to the work and had actually slammed the door in the face of the last Witness who called on her. The brother spoke with tact and was able to arouse her interest in the message. When he offered the magazines, the woman declined, saying she did not have any money. However, the brother left them anyway and promised to call again to collect the contribution. On the second call he was able to place the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie,’ </span><span class="font9">and the woman hid it from her husband, thinking he would be angry with her for taking it without his consent. Shortly after, her husband found the book and asked where it had come from. His wife told him about the visit of the vacation pioneer brother and how he had offered to call back and help her to study it. To her surprise, her husband was not angry and began to read parts of the book. After reading chapter 20, about the future of the earth as a paradise, the husband agreed that it would be a good idea to have the brother call and help them both. A study was started and both made rapid progress in spite of opposition from other members of their family who are staunch Catholics. The husband is an enthusiastic athlete and was elected Mr. Costa Rica and Mr. Central America, but now he is more interested in spiritual calisthenics than the physical kind. In just four months they have both started engaging in field service and are attending the meetings regularly. Also, as a result of talking to their relatives, two others are now studying with them and attending the meetings. This couple are planning to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah at the coming assembly in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CUBA</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Cuba have been under fierce opposition during the past year. Brothers have been arrested and cruelly beaten in an effort to make them give up their faith in Jehovah. Kingdom Halls have been closed. The brothers have been warned that they must not engage in the field ministry, under threat of imprisonment. As the year closed, the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces official journal </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Verde Olivo</span><span class="font10"> began publishing a defamatory series of propaganda articles against the Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While the peak of publishers was not as high this year as last, on the whole the brothers have shown tremendous courage and steadfastness in their ministry, averaging over twelve hours each month in the service, between six and seven back-calls and more than one Bible study. Additionally, they had several thousand vacation pioneers in the service in April. However, in view of the increasing opposition to the work, further details are not given. In letters received, the following is learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers are under constant scrutiny and surveillance in everything they do. Some were warned that it was illegal to meet in private homes to study the Bible, as is customarily done at service centers. Soon thereafter a sister who works in a cleaning establishment found in the pants pocket of a Communist on the “block committee” a list of all the service centers in that area. In some places when two or three friends have met together even for a friendly visit, they have been arrested and prosecuted, under bond of $100 each. If someone visits your home, soon one of the block committee will drop over on one pretext or another to find who is there and what it is all about. Even taxi drivers often refuse to take passengers without first getting all the information and finding out what a person is carrying with him so that a later report can be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Early in the year in Las Villas province more than forty Kingdom Halls were closed. The police explained that meetings in homes were not permitted, as they are not registered as temples. Similar actions have been taken in Pinar del Rio province and elsewhere throughout the island. In November about 300 young Witnesses of military age were arrested and sent to camps under military control. Some were seized so quickly and without warning they could not even say good-bye to their families, while officials professed ignorance of their whereabouts. They were sent to supposed reform centers for useless members of society. These camps are called Military Units for Helping the Production. In such camps the brothers have been mercilessly tortured to try to break their faith so they will denounce their ministry and accept military activities. Some were pushed, beaten and prodded by soldiers with bayonets because they objected to getting into military vehicles since they were not military personnel. On arriving at camp, days of terrible persecution followed. Some were buried with only their heads outside the ground, their faces beaten and scorched by sun all day. Others were told to dig their own tomb and warned they would be shot and buried there if they did not become soldiers. Many were severely beaten day after day to break down their resistance; water and food were denied them, and they were forced to sleep outside in the cold and rain of the winter months. Then officials with a paternal smile would consolingly advise them not to make things so hard for themselves and to think of their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How strong their faith is can be seen from the following note: “No matter what we are going through, hunger, beatings, sleeping naked outside in the cold and having cold water thrown on us continuously, to us the important thing is to be in Jehovah’s favor. They took David and Domingo out at twelve o’clock to punish them. We do not know where they are.” Another says: “They took two out to execute them. Later we learned that their fate was much worse. They had to dig holes, drive stakes into them and were tied to these stakes, left there three days without food or sleep, at the mercy of mosquitoes and other insects. Others were placed in holes just big enough to hold them standing up naked. But we are not downhearted. We still reply with Paul’s words: ‘Nothing can separate us from the love of Jesus.’ Pray for us as we do for you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A husband writes a tender letter to his wife of only a few months: “I pray to Jehovah daily that we may be reunited in the new system of things, since they say that we are not going to be sent to prison, that either we become soldiers or we go to the cemetery. So be faithful and pray for us.” In place of the names of infamous concentration camps of the past such as Auschwitz, Belsen and Sachsenhausen we now have new names: the camp at Cunagua, Camp Lugareno, Camp Monte, Quemado, and so forth, and in place of the sadistic commanders of past, now we hear of new names: Second Lieutenant Mario of Camp Cunagua and First Lieutenant Mora, or Captain Salvador Sosa, who ordered a brother taken to a cistern and cemented inside while others were tied with barbed wire around their necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Despite all this, the work of bearing witness to the Kingdom continues, and the brothers are heartened by the words of Paul at 2 Corinthians 4:7-11: “However, we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves. We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed. Always we endure everywhere in our body the death-dealing treatment given to Jesus, that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our body. For we who live are ever being brought face to face with death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CYPRUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;600,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 438 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,370</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The political situation continues to be tense in Cyprus. The United Nations army is trying to keep the peace between the Greeks and the Turks living on the island, and they have drawn what they call a “green line” to divide the Greeks from the Turks, but shooting on the streets is not uncommon. Bomb explosions at the post office and in other buildings are often seen and heard. In spite of all this the witnesses of Jehovah are fearless and they are determined to intensify their activity so as to reach as many persons as possible with the truth. Under such trying circumstances it is not expected that there would be a great increase, but there were 14 baptized, and, together with all the ministers there, they are regularly conducting 246 Bible studies in the homes of the people. You will enjoy reading what the branch servant writes in his annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This past year was a year of great excitement for us here in Cyprus, some of it very pleasant, such as the visit of Brother Franz with his three friends in August when he spoke at Nicosia to 220 brothers on the sixth chapter of Isaiah, encouraging us to remain steadfast for Jehovah, and some of it unpleasant, such as the passing of the bill to ban our work by the Council of Ministers under the presidency of Archbishop Makarios, Scores of letters have been sent to the Members of the House of Representatives protesting the unjust passing of the Bill, which, at the moment of writing this report, has not yet been discussed in the House of Representatives and so has not become law. Of interest is a letter of protest sent by a Turkish family interested in the truth. The letter, in part, says: “If this bill is passed as a law, we shall not be able to speak to other Turks and help them believe in Christ because if we speak to people about Christ you will arrest us and put us in prison.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The U.N. sent an army of about 5,000 soldiers here to keep the peace between Greeks and Turks. However, the truth is stronger than any army. A sister writes: “I went to visit a Turkish lady who showed interest at my first visit and got some literature in her language. She invited me in and we had a very pleasant discussion. On my next visit this lady invited another Turkish lady who was full of questions. She wanted to know about baptism, if there were any differences between Jehovah’s witnesses and the Orthodox church, and so forth. I gave her answers to all these questions, using my Bible, and I spoke to her about the moral principles that govern the lives of Jehovah’s witnesses. This Turkish lady replied: ‘Now I understand why they are persecuting you. Satan hates you because you are very good people, and he has made you his target.’ I have a Bible study with them now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">People in Cyprus like to sit in coffee shops discussing the various subjects of the day, and Jehovah’s witnesses take this opportunity to spread the message of the Kingdom to them there. A brother writes: “I went to the nearby village to sell my lemons and other goods. The coffee shop was the best place for that. I started at the same time speaking to people there about the truth. They were asking questions on various subjects, and with my Bible, which I had with me, I was answering them. The priest was there and was nodding approvingly. Then an opposer came in. He immediately started shouting, saying a lot of lies against me. The priest all of a sudden changed his attitude. He rushed on me like a bull who suddenly saw a red cloth. He took the Bible out of my hands and threw it into the street, challenging me to complain by saying a word against him so that he would find an excuse to hit me. I calmly said to him that the Bible he threw away was one published by the Greek Orthodox Church. My peaceful attitude impressed the other villagers, who started asking more questions when the priest left the coffee shop. Many were the ones who expressed themselves very favourably about us because of our attitude. Because of the good impression I gave them, I was able not only to give them a good witness but to sell my lemons earlier than I anticipated and to return to my village.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DAHOMEY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,234 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,621</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the month of March 1966 the Society opened a branch office in Dahomey, much to the delight of the brothers. Dahomey is a small country, but the brothers are faced with problems of communication and language. There are seven major languages spoken within the country and an additional twenty-four dialects, which makes it very difficult for all the people to communicate with one another. French is the official language, but less than 7 percent of the people who are in the truth in Dahomey speak this language. They are well acquainted, of course, with their own language and preach the good news in such language, but meeting together is a bit difficult. The brothers enjoyed a very fine increase, 14 percent, during the year, but there is a large territory yet to be worked, especially in the northern part of the country. The branch servant is very enthusiastic about moving out into this new territory. He gives us some experiences of what is going on in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Recently a circuit servant traveling to the next congregation took advantage of the opportunity to do some incidental witnessing. The man sitting next to him was a gentleman some eighty years of age. Speaking to the man, he found he was a Methodist minister. The circuit servant left the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet with him and, getting the man’s name and address, requested that a brother call on him. When the brother called, the minister said he had been a minister most of his life but had never understood what the Kingdom was until he read the booklet. As he lived much too far away to hold a Bible study, the brother invited him to a circuit assembly being held soon. The man not only attended, but four months later got baptised. He is now a regular publisher in his hometown, where a pioneer has been sent to help him build up an isolated group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The value of association is often felt by those who are quite new in the truth. A government doctor had a Bible study for only a short while, when the government assigned him to a town in the far north of Dahomey. The closest congregation was 300 miles away. After a year in his new position he wrote to the brother, saying he wanted to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses again. The brother informed him of an assembly that would be held very soon in the northernmost town, where there is a congregation. It was 300 miles away, with very poor roads, and the only transportation was by open trucks. The doctor traveled most of Thursday night and Friday to reach the assembly just to be among the brothers again. He enjoyed the association of the brothers so much that he asked if someone would come to his home and teach him so he could dedicate his life to God and become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. One month later two brothers spent one month at his home. They conducted a Bible study with him every morning before he went to work. While he was at work they witnessed in the town. After work he joined them and spent thirty-nine hours in the first month. His parents and wife both tried hard to persuade him not to leave the Catholic faith, but now his wife is taking an interest too. Now he conducts four regular Bible studies and has arranged for his vacation during the coming district assembly so that he can symbolize his dedication by baptism there. This has also provided a wonderful opportunity to push the work 300 miles to the north where no publisher had ever been before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DENMARK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,774,789</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10,872 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 439</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The upsurge of material interests and the concern for the present system of things continues to grow in Denmark. The people show great indifference to religious matters, and the majority of the people, it appears, do not want to hear with their ears or see with their eyes. The truth and an understanding of it are far from them. During the past year there has been no persecution from the people witnessed to nor even much reaction. Notwithstanding, Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark have pushed ahead with the ministry. A good witness was given from one end of the country to the other, but during the past four years, even though 1,500 persons have been baptized and have taken up the preaching of the good news, there has been no increase in the total number of publishers. In these same four years more than five million hours have been spent talking to the people of Denmark. It makes us think of the days of Isaiah when the people would “not actually turn back and get healing for themselves.” (Isa. 6:10) However, Jehovah’s witnesses will keep on preaching and calling on the homes of the people, because there are still some there that have ears to hear. The branch office in Copenhagen, Denmark, which looks after the work in <a name="bookmark155"></a><a name="bookmark156"></a>Denmark, Faroe Islands and Greenland, supplied some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The biggest event with regard to our preaching was receiving the new book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font9"> It has now been used for more than three months and many Bible studies have been started with it. Some brothers had been telling their relatives about the book for quite some time and had it arranged so that when the book came a study would be started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Incidental witnessing is of great value. A sister became ill and called in a woman to help with the housework. She informed the woman that the family were Jehovah’s witnesses and the manner of living it involved. When the meals were started by expressing thanks to Jehovah, this woman accepted it as a natural thing and expressed her surprise over the natural way in which the prayer was expressed, not just a little rhyme spoken from memory. Her knowledge of other religions enabled her to see the difference with the truth. In the course of a few days she obtained the special issues of our magazines and asked many questions. When the sister became well she continued to keep in touch with this interested woman, and the first visit resulted in a double witness, as this woman commended the Witnesses to her religious family. The sister writes: “In addition, the stay in our home resulted in her asking if she could attend one of our assemblies.” She gratefully accepted an invitation to the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother had used an incidental opportunity eighteen years ago to witness to a young Norwegian girl staying awhile in Denmark. It was not long before she exclaimed: “Now for the first time I understand the purpose of life.” A Bible study was started, but a short time later the young girl left the country and lost contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. Sixteen years later this brother received a letter from her stating that she had again gotten in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses because, as she said, “the truth has been in me all the time.” A new study was started and soon she was coming along in the truth, attending meetings and assemblies. As the brother writes: “Though disappointed when we lost touch of her, how much greater was our happiness when we heard from her again! We rejoiced at meeting her at an assembly and even more when we learned she had been baptized.” Yes, “send out your bread upon the surface of the waters, for in the course of many days you will find it again.”—Eccl. 11:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Christian conduct often makes a deep impression. A brother who ran a tourist home had four teachers and their families from Germany staying there. One taught religion, so before long there were many discussions of Biblical subjects under way, and he listened with great respect. But an older couple listened with more interest and, though there is a limit to what can be said in a few weeks, it still gets results. A circuit servant later met this family who had shown the most interest and was invited in. The wife told of her stay in Denmark and said: “When I saw the harmony in their family life and their well-balanced way of reacting to things, I said to my husband that if becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses could make one that way, then I wanted to be one.” Because many people travel as tourists now, there are many possibilities for preaching, which, if used, give good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FAROE ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34,596</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,153</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here discussions at the doors are generally one-sided, with the publishers doing the talking. And on back-calls, where various subjects are considered, it is still largely the publisher who talks. But these publishers know that the best teaching method is to get the one visited to express himself, so they form questions that require only very short, or even one-word answers, to bring the person into the conversation, and they try to carry on progressive teaching. In time the person being visited gets quite a bit of knowledge of the Bible and the picture of the truth begins to form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One publisher tells: “A friendly, elderly woman had accepted magazines for a long time. Several times someone almost got a Bible study started. Several subjects had been considered, and every time I tried to consider them in as near to a study method as I could, even though most answers were ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘of course,’ and so forth. This took much effort and much patience. But it was not in vain. Later in the house-to-house witnessing I met a young woman who showed interest. I was surprised at her friendly reception. In the course of the conversation she explained that her grandmother had told her about the paradise that we talked about. A study was arranged and, contributing to my pleasure at this, I was to learn that the grandmother was the elderly woman who had answered so often with one-word answers yet who had gained much knowledge of the Bible and was telling it to others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GREENLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36,967</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 26 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,422</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Early in this service year the two congregations and the pioneers in Greenland enjoyed the visit of a brother from the Danish branch, who was able to counsel and encourage them on his way home from attending Gilead School in Brooklyn. Some of the families who had put forth much effort to preach in this very isolated and rigorous territory for several years have now returned to Denmark, but others are planning to travel there and continue building further on the foundation that has been laid, together with those remaining there. In addition to their preaching, the brothers are becoming well known for the way they do their secular work, thoroughly and conscientiously, and in this way have created much respect for Jehovah’s witnesses. This was observed when one of the local leading men entrusted an important job to some brothers, emphasizing at the time the reputation these brothers had for honesty and dependability in their work and getting things done on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Through film showings and talks an extensive witness has been given, and where there is interest, then age or other problems will not hinder. There was a seventy-six-year-old woman, nearly blind, who, along with a younger companion, came to a talk, in spite of the fact that she had to climb over about 150 meters (165 yards) of ice-covered rocks to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Great changes are taking place on Greenland as a result of bringing in industry. One bad effect is that moral standards are getting worse. At the same time, this development has served to awaken some Greenlanders to the need for a ballast in these critical times, a ballast in the form of the message from the Bible of God’s kingdom. Some schoolteachers are using articles from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> when considering matters of family life and moral conduct of the young, and often open their homes to provide accommodations for travelling missionaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Population: 4,070,100 Peak Publishers: 2,254 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,806</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses lived through another year marked with spasmodic gun battles in the streets, exploding bombs during the night and roving mobs of uncontrolled youths who destroyed everything in their path. These and many other turbulent conditions have been the order of the day, but still God’s servants in the Dominican Republic have continued preaching the good news of the Kingdom and with remarkable results. They feel like the psalmist who said: “Praise Jah, you people! Offer praise, O you servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah.” (Ps. 113:1) And so as they praised the name of Jehovah God many listened during the year, and in this small island of the Caribbean 351 persons symbolized by water baptism their dedication to Jehovah. At the close of the year we find a 27-percent increase in the number of publishers declaring the good news. The brothers there had a remarkable year. There were 125,000 more hours spent in the field ministry and so the brothers passed the half-million mark in total hours. There were more bound books distributed than ever before. There was a large increase in the number of new subscriptions for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines, and there was an excellent distribution of individual copies of the magazines. Bible studies increased from 2,685 to 3,453. Yes, things happened in the Dominican Republic, and the brothers there are taking advantage of the time that they still have to declare the good news. They feel the urgency of the day! Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the greatest issues confronting the brothers in this country is that of neutrality. Living in a country of turmoil, one is constantly confronted by one faction or another for an expression of loyalty. Our brothers, however, have been adamant in their neutral stand, and this has brought much respect to Jehovah’s witnesses from all sides. It is not uncommon when one is being stopped or questioned by the police or military to be excused immediately upon stating: “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following experience bears out the need for strict neutrality. One day during a period of heated demonstrations, one of our brothers had just picked up his wife at her place of work and they were on their way home when they were confronted by a howling mob of several hundred persons. At once the mob proceeded to smash the windshield of the car and tear off the doors, then they dragged the brother from his car, breaking his glasses in the process. He tried to explain that he was neutral and that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but to no avail. Part of the mob managed to tear open the trunk of his car, which contained his witnessing bag filled with literature, and, on examining the contents of his literature bag and seeing that he really was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the fury of the mob subsided and he was released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Being persistent in making back-calls can prove to be very rewarding. One of our special pioneers made arrangements to call back where a book had been placed. Once, twice, three times he went back. Each time there was no response to his knock on the door. Again he went back, and this time the householder responded, inviting him into the house. She stated that she had not answered the door before because her pastor had told her not to talk with Jehovah’s witnesses. However, in discussing this situation with many of her friends she learned that they were having studies with Jehovah’s witnesses. And now she, too, wanted to study because, as she said: “I learn nothing from my pastor.” So it is best not to give out when those with whom we have made arrangements to call are not at home or refuse to answer the door. It just may be that by being persistent another interested person will be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Being alert to adapt oneself to the situation at hand is the mark of a mature minister. In this country the godless political elements are striving to capture the minds especially of the youth. One such youth whose mind was well on the way to captivity responded to the knock of one of the brothers on his door. He immediately informed the brother that he liked communism very much and that this was the hope of the people. The brother tactfully explained that it is really God’s kingdom that is the hope of the world. After a discussion the brother offered the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">World Conquest Soon—by God’s Kingdom.</span><span class="font9"> This was accepted. A back-call was made and the youth stated that he had read the booklet with great interest. A study was started, and now this person is awaiting the national assembly to symbolize his dedication to Jehovah. The truth of God’s Word appeals to those with the right heart condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ECUADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,153,918</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,575 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,272</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark158"></a>The country of Ecuador has had its troubles during the past year. Much has been said about mending the nation’s economy, but even so the cost of living increases daily. The people are finding it more difficult to find employment. Despite these conditions Jehovah’s witnesses have the responsibility of calling on the people to bring the comfort of the Scriptures to them. This they did with excellent success during the 1966 service year. They enjoyed a 9-percent increase, placed many subscriptions for the magazines with the people and distributed 33,000 more individual copies of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font10"> magazines in Spanish than last year. More Bible studies were conducted too. So the prosperity among God’s people in Ecuador has been fine. Here are some experiences that the branch servant sent in.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">The vacation pioneer work has been a source of great encouragement to many congregations, and invariably it is found that, not only does this service increase the activity of those who are able to share in the pioneer work, but it also enhances the appreciation and effort of the other members of the congregation. In one isolated group near the capital city where there are only thirteen publishers, seven of these brothers served as vacation pioneers during the last month of the service year. This so encouraged all in the group that the remaining publishers spent more hours in the service than the entire group had done in any of the previous six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the regular pioneers in a congregation began a study about the beginning of the service year with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font9">person who had been </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> prominent member of the Pentecostal religion for some eight years. After about two months of study the members of his church began visiting him to try to dissuade him from receiving Jehovah’s witnesses in his home. He was offered a position as pastor, other remunerative work, medicine and even money if he would just stop studying. Even demonic influence was brought to bear on him, and the man became physically and nervously sick. For the next few weeks he could not study, but the pioneer kept on visiting him and encouraged him at least to continue with his reading. This he did, gaining spiritual strength on doctrinal points, especially with the help of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book. Resisting the arguments of his false comforters, he placed this book with three of them. On recovery from his sickness he resumed his own study, and soon he and his wife became active publishers. Now he is conducting Bible studies with two of the persons who tried to influence him against the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother who received a visit from one of his relatives used the opportunity for incidental witnessing, and after the visit he wrote the brothers in the hometown of his relative asking them to visit this person. When a brother made the first visit he was met with the objection that the person had only listened to his relative out of curiosity and that he was perfectly satisfied with his own religion. So the publisher simply conversed informally, but tactfully pointed out the difference between the zealous activity of Jehovah’s witnesses and the formalistic religious practices of others. The man’s curiosity was obviously increasing and arrangements were made to continue the conversation the following week. On this next visit the man had prepared a series of questions on subjects like the use of images, the trinity, hell, and so forth, and after giving some very brief answers the brother showed that the points could be more satisfactorily handled by an organized investigation of the doctrines, so a study was started with the man and his wife. There were obviously other curious persons in the family, and the brother noted that each week when he came for the study there was always a new person present. In time it was necessary to change the location of the study to accommodate the fourteen regular participants. From the beginning the family responded to encouragement to associate with others in the “house of our God.” Now five of them share regularly in field service, meeting the goal of ten hours, some of which are dedicated to sharing the truth with yet other members of their numerous family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The circuit servants have been giving much encouragement and personal help to the brothers in starting Bible studies, and this has been by far our best year in this feature of the ministry. A number of the publishers have good back-calls, but they just seem to have difficulty getting the study started. A circuit servant went with one of the sisters on a few back-calls and began a study at one of these. From that very first study the family was invited to attend meetings. On his following visit four months later, the circuit servant was surprised to be greeted on Tuesday evening by the wife and mother of the family. She told him that she and her husband had been attending meetings ever since his previous visit. Arrangements were made for them to share in field service the following Sunday morning, and the circuit servant had the privilege of accompanying both of them, together with their six-month-old baby, on their first day in the field. After just three calls the husband began to make his own presentations and placed magazines at his first door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,880,752</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 268 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 10,749</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses are becoming more widely known in this land, and it appears that the work is taking on greater momentum. Out of the 254 regular publishers in the country, 87 are special pioneers and nine are regular pioneers. However, the 7-percent increase came through congregation publishers’ taking up the ministry. We would like to have more special pioneers go into Eire, as the territory certainly needs more ministers. It was good to see a greater number of hours spent in preaching the good news of the Kingdom and more Bible studies started during the year, so our brothers rejoice. Even though the increase is small, it is steady. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following experience underlines the effectiveness of tactfully witnessing to those with whom one comes in contact in secular work. In the course of his employment a brother moved to one of the larger towns where we have a special pioneer group but no local publishers. Shortly after arriving he took into his firm’s employment a local girl to do secretarial work. She was a staunch Catholic and readily joined in discussions involving religion. At this point she knew that the brother was a non-Catholic and a firm believer in the Bible. She expressed concern that he was not a Catholic and good-humoredly declared that she would try to convert him. During succeeding discussions she acknowledged the brother’s sincerity and Bible knowledge, and she expressed regret that so many people who ardently profess to be religious are lacking in sincerity and love. She admitted that, at times, this had even caused her to doubt the existence of God. “From then,” wrote the brother, “after office hours, we really began to examine the authenticity of God’s Word, using the Douay version of the Bible, which she took home and read avidly.” A regular study using the Bible only was started, and it was then that the brother began to explain the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. This disturbed her a little at first, but by this time the truth had really taken hold and she just had to come back for more. Shortly she began to attend all the group’s meetings, enrolled in the ministry school and shared in the field service. She was baptized at the latest circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Use of the direct approach to start home Bible studies has had good results in many parts of the field. One special pioneer sister reported introducing the study method during the first call on a Catholic lady who had had previous discussions of the truth. She responded immediately to this method of Bible study and a regular study was soon established. A little later she moved to the outskirts of the city and expressed deep appreciation that the sister was willing to travel out and continue the study with her. Although she has a family of twelve children to care for, she is always well prepared for the study and she and some of her children are making fine progress. She discusses the truth with her family and some of them have begun attending meetings. She is also making arrangements for a call to be made on her natural sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From time to time we continue to get evidence of the good effect of the “Word of Truth” assembly we had in Dublin last year. As a result of the assembly publicity a couple who later said that they had prayed to find the truth had their attention turned to Jehovah’s witnesses as a people who might have what they were seeking. A little later a group of publishers was working in the neighborhood where the couple live when a priest tried to hinder their ministry by arguing with them and then sending children to all the homes warning the householders not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses. One of these children called at the home of this couple, but this only served to prepare them for the very discussion they were wanting. When two sisters approached their door they invited them in. They immediately recognized the ring of the truth and a home Bible study was started. Not long afterward the couple attended meetings and began witnessing to their family and friends. They, too, are making rapid progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EL SALVADOR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,013,900</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 995 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,029</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark160"></a>Many more Kingdom publishers could be used</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">in El Salvador to spread the Word of God. The plea to Paul comes to mind: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.” (Acts 16:9) But even though not too much outside help comes in, the brothers diligently press on declaring the good news, and they are getting their help from inside the country, because they have had an 8-percent increase and forty-nine persons were baptized during the past service year. The organization within El Salvador has grown from 892 regular publishers to 959. We wish, however, that more people were there to help them with their large population. It appears from the report that many people want Bible studies. One book study conductor was asked if he could take care of a new Bible study, but it was found that he already was conducting eight home Bible studies, and that keeps a regular publisher quite busy in the evenings. The harvest is great, but the workers are few in El Salvador. The branch servant sent in some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Great appreciation for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> was shown by the brothers, as is illustrated by this letter that was recently sent in: “I placed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> with a family with whom I study and encouraged them as a family to read the daily text and consider the experiences from the different countries. What a blessing it proved to be for them, for not only did it encourage them to study more but it showed them how to apply Bible principles in their lives! The mother, being a schoolteacher, read what others of Jehovah’s witnesses who are schoolteachers have done in regard to flag-salute ceremonies. She then instructed her own children on God’s laws. The family did this without a word of instruction from me. Since then the mother and daughter have started publishing the good news and the family continues to make good progress. Thank you again for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Would you be willing to lose home, family and a secular education for the truth? One sister writes: “When I began to study I was visiting my grandparents, but the third study was to be conducted in my home. Knowing that my parents would be opposed, we studied outside my home at the gate of our court. I was right. My father found us there, interrupted the study and told me that if I continued to study the Bible he would not help me to finish school. He was so angry that he said: ‘There’s the door, and the street is wide, and you can forget that I am your father, if you don’t listen to me.' ” What would you do? The sister continues: “My love for the truth was so strong that I continued the study even though I had to leave home for a while due to so much pressure. Opposition continues in my home, but I am a happy Kingdom publisher now for seven months. I have two of my own Bible studies and am looking forward to symbolizing my dedication at our next assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Interest can be found among the aged and the handicapped if we show patience and take time to help them. A missionary sister writes: “I have a wonderful study with an eighty-eight-year-old woman with poor eyesight. To study with her I first read the paragraph and then ask the question, and she gives the answer. She wanted to learn more of the Bible but was very forgetful. So I began to write scriptures on the blackboard with letters three inches high. During the week she studied these and learned them by heart. Now the lady is a publisher, goes from house to house and, with a little help, gives the sermon from memory. Her presence is a stimulus to our whole group.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A family with whom I study has an eight-year-old daughter who attends a Catholic school. Every Saturday religious classes are held, and all the students must repeat the prayer that the nun teaches. This young Bible student was not repeating the prayers, and the nun warned her that she would be punished if she did not obey. So the nun began reciting: ‘Holy Mary, mother of God,’ and then said, ‘Now, you say it.’ The little girl said, ‘Holy Mary, mother of Jesus Christ.’ On hearing this the nun became very angry and said that she must say, ‘Mother of God’! The young student answered: ‘But the Bible teaches that Mary is the mother of Jesus,’ and asked, ‘Why don’t you read the Bible and teach it?’ The nun answered: ‘Our minds are too small to understand such things.’ The young girl then asked: ‘Why is it that the minds of Jehovah’s witnesses are able to understand?’ The nun had no answer and the issue was dropped.” Parents, be sure that your children have an active part in your Bible studies so that they, too, can make a defense of their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;456,000</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark162"></a>In the South Pacific there are many islands, a goodly number of them well populated, and the only way to reach these people is to send Jehovah’s witnesses there. Over the years this has been done and good progress has been made in declaring the good news. The branch office is located in Suva in the Fiji island group, and the work of the Fiji branch shows that there has been a 6-percent increase for the combined reports of the ten island territories of Fiji, American Samoa, Cook Islands, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Niue, Tahiti, Tonga and Western Samoa. All these islands make up the branch territory and reports are set out herewith for each of these islands.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">More people than ever before are associating with the organization throughout these beautiful tropical islands. Seven hundred people regularly attend the weekly </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study throughout the branch territory, which is fine in view of the fact that the peak publisher figure for the year was 640. A greater standard of maturity is being obtained, and while a number of territories did not make any increase during the year, prospects for the next service year are very bright. The enthusiasm of the brothers was at its highest peak when the service year closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you are a newer publisher, have you cooperated with efforts to continue helping you to study the two basic publications of the Society, or do you feel that because you are now a publisher of the good news you can stand on your own two feet? A nineteen-year-old publisher associating with a congregation discontinued studying with the one assisting her not long after she started publishing and, as a result, she was not a very strong publisher, although continuing active. Arrangements were made through the congregation for a special pioneer to study through the basic books with her, and she soon started to make better progress in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Not long afterward it was found that the sister had leukemia, the fatal blood disease. She was admitted to a hospital. Doctors planned an operation in a bid to prolong her life with a blood transfusion. However, even though doctors told her that she might die within a week if she refused a transfusion, she still held faithful. A doctor said to her in frustration: “Who is this Jehovah that you are talking about? He won’t save you now! The only thing that will save you is blood!” The sister quietly answered: “You sound like Pharaoh of Egypt when he spoke to Moses.” The doctor, a Methodist, stalked away, speechless. A few days later the young nineteen-year-old sister died, faithfully resisting all efforts to coerce her (and her parents in the truth) to take a blood transfusion. Just before she died she said to her weeping mother: “Don’t weep, because you only discourage me. You should think of yourself and how you can stand firm before Jehovah when your turn comes.” And to the special pioneer, she said: “I want to thank you very much for helping me, because I don’t think I would have been able to trust in Jehovah so much if it had not been for the study.” Certainly, then, if you are assigned to study with a newer publisher, or if you are being assisted, you are wise if you cooperate together lovingly, knowing that it may mean the difference between faithfulness and unfaithfulness on your part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICAN SAMOA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,581</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The service year reached its zenith for American Samoa and all branch territories with the interisland assembly in Pago Pago. Eighteen months’ preparation saw gratifying rewards. Shipping, usually a problem, worked in perfectly for arriving and departing delegates. Almost 300 brothers from Tahiti, Tonga, Niue, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji, Western and American Samoa, eight of the ten branch territories, also from New Zealand and Australia, came together in the traditional island spirit of warmth. From the beginning it was noted how quickly the eight language groups began to mix freely, mostly communicating with gesticulating hands but somehow getting across. As arriving brothers swelled the number of the local congregation of twenty-eight Witnesses, people were forced to admit that Jehovah’s witnesses constitute no insignificant organization, for now there was a ratio of one of them to every thirty-five persons in the main bay area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the outset it could be seen that this was to be the Number One convention to date, the best yet. In a modern hall, a special three-leaf-clover-shaped platform was designed to take care of simultaneous language translations into English, French, Fijian and Samoan. Spreading out from the arches supporting a great golden crown were three rows of colorful luxuriant shrubs that divided off the main language groups. The peak attendance of 372 was far more than expected. One enthusiastic group, on returning to their country, bestirred those who did not attend so much that the stay-behinds said: “Never again will we miss an assembly!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">COOK ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,720</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“Remember those who are taking the lead among you,” is admonition by Paul that has not been forgotten by our brothers in Rarotonga. True, it was a disappointment when the special pioneer family of three had to return to New Zealand in the mid-service year, but remaining brothers have continued to “imitate their faith,” though the publisher ranks decreased with their leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brother now “guarding their souls” continues following the faithful lead of those pioneers in providing loving assistance to those being saved. Every meeting he collects the distant brothers in his faithful thirty-six-year-old Model-T Ford, thus making sure that none misses out on spiritual “food in due season.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Patience and endurance are virtues needed in the far-flung isolated islands of the Pacific. Such virtues pay off. In these islands there is much travelling back and forth by the populace, which makes it difficult for follow-up work and Bible studies. One family resorted to correspondence to aid persons to increase their accurate knowledge. With only a monthly mail service to some islands and less to others, letters continued to be written. Now one interested couple on Ocean Island has progressed to the point where they express their desire to be baptized. Although these folk have had no one visit them for over a year, they keenly look forward to the day when a brother will baptize them to symbolize their dedication. This will remain a problem, as there are so few ships and they are generally booked out by officials. Not discouraged, this couple continues to share their increased knowledge with others on their island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Ellice group, the brothers are becoming better known as a reliable, honest people through their application of Bible principles and the house-to-house ministry. An official remarked of one brother: “Yes, So-and-so is one of our finer-type citizens.” Through perseverance in the ministry by such ones the villagers of this tiny atoll of Funafuti (population 600) realize, too, that these brothers are there to stay. A small assembly was arranged to instruct these brothers further in their ministry and dealings with one another. The six publishers were stimulated when they saw an attendance of thirty-five at the public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW CALEDONIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;84,480</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A young man from an outer island moved to Noumea, where he met his fleshly brother. His brother had been contacted by Jehovah’s witnesses and before he returned to the island he advised the young man: &quot;You too must study with them; they have the truth.” Although he searched for Jehovah’s witnesses and their meeting place, he had no success. One day he visited a friend and, on seeing the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font9"> booklet, he asked: “Who gave you that?” “The New World society,” was the reply. “Then are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses and do you know my brother?” On getting an affirmative answer, he requested a study, which was arranged that day. Two months later he began field service and after seven months was baptized. Later he received a letter from his fleshly brother, saying: “I just gave a very good talk in church because I used Jehovah’s witnesses’ booklet. Everyone said it was a good talk.” The new publisher wrote back: “It was you who showed me the right way with Jehovah’s witnesses, but now you continue to be a member of Babylon the Great!” He has now become a teacher of his own brother who first admonished him to study the way of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW HEBRIDES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61,476</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">This is a land where illiteracy is common and superstition rife. Missions have possession of much land on which they allow their members to live. One such man who lived on land controlled by a Catholic church came into possession of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book, which he enjoyed. The wife, while in the Catholic hospital some time afterward, was reading the book and had it snatched away and confiscated by a nun who said: “You cannot read this. Why, this book is full of lies.” Later, when he heard this, the indignant husband had his family stop attending church. Pressure was constantly brought against him to return. His sister was told: “Your brother is living on church land. If he doesn’t come to church he may lose his home.” On hearing this the man told his wife: “Start packing, we can find our own place to live.” Although hard pressed financially, he was able to rent a place free from church pressure. “Now,” he told his wife, “we’ll stay here with no religion until the true people of God find us.” Within several weeks they were found by a different brother. A new </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book was obtained for the wife and an </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book for the husband. On the same call a study was started with the whole family. At once he began attending meetings, rejoicing in the truth, and was astounded at how the catechism had taught him just the opposite of Bible truth. Within two months he began field service, thus becoming the fifth local publisher of the ‘truth that sets men free.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NIUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,200</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Paul wrote: “I am longing to see you . . . that there may be an interchange of encouragement.” This same longing has been between the branch office and the brothers in Niue, particularly since they had their latest circuit visit two years ago. Previously, visits were limited to the half day his ship was in port, but this June the circuit servant was able to stay six weeks with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the biggest obstacles to spiritual understanding is the lack of any publication in Niuean, but commendation is due the brothers for their fine effort in studying the Society’s English literature. The circuit servant made fine use of his time by helping them further in this way. With the aid of a Niuean brother to translate, he and his wife studied half the assigned </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> material with a family. The following day a member of that family would go to another family’s home and study it with them. In turn, a member of this family would go to another’s and study it with them. With what result? All hands were up every Sunday at the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study and everyone commented, to the delight of the study conductor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">One brother, by covering all the homes in his territory, was overjoyed to meet a man who said: “How happy I am to meet Jehovah’s witnesses at last!” He explained that many times before he had waited for Witnesses to call when he saw them in the neighbourhood but they always bypassed his house. It was learned that, since his house was on a corner of two streets, publishers working one street thought it belonged to the other street and would be called on by the others. Consequently it stood on “no man’s” territory and was missed every time. Meanwhile, the man felt that perhaps the Witnesses disliked him or that someone had dissuaded them from calling on him. Imagine how very happy and relieved he was to learn that this was not so as he eagerly agreed to arrangements for a study. Now he is attending the group study center and progressing well toward dedication. But to what extent would this man have progressed had he been contacted earlier through more careful coverage of the territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That demons can cause sickness through a gift in one’s possession is shown here. An elderly sister was sick for a long time. After reading </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> thought-provoking article in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> published two years ago about another sister’s being ill from a gift in her possession associated with superstition and demonism, she began examining the possibility of this being the reason in her case, as her doctor was at a loss to diagnose the cause. Tahitians are increasingly using carved images called </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">tikis</span><span class="font9"> to decorate homes or gardens. There, decorating the verandah of her home was one such </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">tiki</span><span class="font9"> of black stone, a relative’s gift. She would not have dreamed of having a modern, religious image in her home, but she did not associate this ugly, grimacing thing with crudely outthrust tongue, so normal and common about the island, with the fact that it really represented a demon god worshipped by ancient Tahitians. After reading that article she saw it for what it was and made arrangements to get rid of it immediately. Shortly after this she began feeling better and was on the way to recovery. What she feels now in the way of illness is due to age and is not the debilitating illness she had had previously.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Our brothers in Tonga have always enjoyed talking the truth to others. In past years many enjoyed learning points for argumentation with Adventists and Mormons, just for the purpose of winning arguments. Now they are learning how futile this is, for it builds no one up and does not draw anyone to Jehovah or his organization. Now things are changing. Previously house-to-house activity was engaged in only during circuit visits, but now this is organized to operate each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are also happy to report that the brothers built their first Kingdom Hall, a thatched building large enough to accommodate thirty persons on land donated by a brother.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">If a study ceases this year, be alert to the direction of the angels when interest is rekindled and enlist the aid of capable brothers to handle opposed menfolk, as in the following experience: Some eleven years ago a sister who had been conducting a study with an interested woman for some time had the village pastor rudely break up the study, calling her an antichrist. The householder permitted this and was too afraid to have this “antichrist” back in her house. Some years later this same pastor was thrown out of their church for “unchristian practices”! When the woman came to work for the sister recently, the study was resumed. Now opposition came from the husband and a hotly opposed policeman son. With her husband, the sister returned to face the couple, and the following night the brother visited the home of the policeman son. Angry opposition was met with calmly offered Scriptural proofs, and within three weeks two studies were in progress, one with the original couple and another at the policeman’s home. Within a short period several members of the family attended talks at the Kingdom Hall, and the woman, her husband and the policeman son all attended sessions of the circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is it worth while finishing off those last few houses in your territory, though the whole morning’s work was unfruitful? Let this experience help you decide: A sister considered giving up the last few houses of her territory because of the broiling heat and a whole morning’s unfruitful work. Sitting under a tree near noon, she found a conflict raging in her mind. Would it, or would it not, be worth while climbing to those last few houses on that mountainside? Urged by a positive decision to go just the same, she found it worth more than the whole morning’s work. She located an interested widow, and a study was started right away. The woman’s interested family also joined the study and are now members of the congregation with their mother. Furthermore, one daughter recently became a pioneer. Now, will you decide to finish off those last few houses too?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The activity of Jehovah’s witnesses during the past service year brought many blessings, and many expressed themselves as being very grateful for the new publication </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> The first 50,000 copies printed at the branch office in Helsinki were all shipped out within three months. Many have been the expressions on the part of the brothers that it is much easier to get people to study with Jehovah’s witnesses now because of this publication. Here are some very interesting experiences from the branch servant on the work being done in Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our young Witnesses have been able to give a good witness in school by using material from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> to their advantage when they have to give talks to the class or write a composition. One young sister was asked to give a talk on behalf of all the students on graduation day expressing thanks to the school. She used the excellent opportunity to advantage. She gathered material from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines on the importance of education and showed that the greatest attention should be paid to learning spiritual things in order to strengthen our faith in the promise concerning the new paradise earth. Some students and even teachers were moved, and the principal of the school commented on the talk, saying: “This we will no doubt remember in even difficult moments because we have a hope towards which to strive.” He added: “This is the first time I have heard that our school has such a beautiful and diversified purpose.” The young sister writes: “After the talk a teacher with tears in her eyes came and asked: ‘Can such a beautiful promise of paradise be true, and do you believe in it yourself?’ I assured her that such was the case, because it is God’s promise and appears in the Bible. After that I had an excellent opportunity to witness to my classmates and tell much more about God’s great and wonderful promises.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Firm determination for the truth is important and bears fruit, as the following experience shows: “Sometime ago I received the address of a woman from our congregation. She had ordered a book from the branch office. When I called on her we immediately started a study, but at the same time I found out that the woman’s husband was an opposer. He had always turned Jehovah’s witnesses away from his door, thus preventing his wife from having any contact with them. When he heard that his wife was studying, he became violently angry and tore all his wife’s books and even their Bible into small pieces. The wife maintained her composure, however, and said: ‘Even if you tear down the walls of the house the truth remains.’ After this the study was continued at my home, and the man continued his opposition and even threatened me. Neither of us showed any signs of fear, and when the man noticed this he staged a suicide attempt and said that he did it because his wife was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. Even this did not affect the wife’s desire to get knowledge, because the study continued. After overcoming many difficulties during the winter she was baptized and became one of Jehovah’s praisers. After her baptism she had to move away, but I got an interesting letter from her in which she first thanked me for the help she had received and then continued: ‘I have been able to praise Jehovah’s name more here than there in the city. I have been able to reach the goals and even pass them. I have my territory and have found two “sheep.” I have conducted a study with the one for three months and have arranged to start a study with the other. In addition I study with my children and I think they have progressed wonderfully well. If you could only have seen how happy I was when I got my first study and what joy there was when I was able to start another in addition to studying with my children! I thank Jehovah from my heart.’ You can guess my joy when I met her at the convention and saw that her husband too had come to the public talk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The same sort of firm determination and zeal was shown by a young dairymaid who got interested in the truth. “A young dairymaid moved into our congregation’s territory, and we received a slip asking us to call on her. A home Bible study was arranged and the interested person progressed rapidly. It was not long before she started to attend meetings regularly and also take part in the field service with the sister who conducted the home Bible study with her. When her employers noticed with whom their dairymaid was associating and studying the Bible, they started to interfere. They decided to protect her ‘from being led astray by evil,’ as they put it. First, they gave her a lecture in which they ‘enlightened’ her and warned about ‘Jehovahite heresy.’ After that changes were made in the dairymaid’s work times so that she would always have to be at work at meeting times. A sister had spoken to her earlier about this possibility, however, so she was able to react to it in the right way. The dairymaid said to her employers: ‘If my work is arranged so that I cannot get to the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses, then I will consider myself free from your service two weeks after the new work arrangements go into force.’ This firm and determined stand caused her employers hurriedly to cancel their requirements and they even raised her wages, fearing that they would lose a good and conscientious worker.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in France, like their brothers in other countries, once more appreciated during the past year the words set forth in Proverbs 10:22: “The blessing of Jehovah—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” A goodly number of people in France have dedicated their lives to Jehovah and have associated themselves with God’s servants in the earth. Sixty-two new congregations were formed last year, so now there are 442 congregations throughout all of France. The message that Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching in this country is being felt from one end of the land to the other, but yet there is much more work to be done. The branch office in France not only looks after the work in France, but also directs the brothers living in Algeria and Tunisia. Here are some experiences from these three countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young publisher was struck by a subject that was to be dealt with in the classroom. It was “The Hebrews According to the Bible.” Eager to see the reaction of his teacher to the use of Jehovah’s inspired book, he took advantage of this occasion and took along his Bible. In the first place, the teacher wanted to know where the publisher obtained his Bible, and if he was a Protestant or a witness of Jehovah. The young publisher did not hesitate to say he was a witness of Jehovah, whereupon the question was put to him: “Who pushes you to be a Witness—is it your parents?” Accepting his own responsibility, the publisher replied: “No, it’s because I want to be a Witness!” Then, to his great surprise, the publisher was invited by the teacher to give a talk on Jehovah’s witnesses before the class. After a few sentences of introduction, the teacher invited the young publisher to take his place behind the desk in order to speak about Jehovah’s witnesses, even inviting the whole class of students to ask questions. The teacher began the discussion by asking: “What do you know about your organization? How did it get its Bible?” Many questions were later asked by the students, such as: When are your meetings held? Is the entrance free? Where does the money come from? What is taught during these meetings? Why did God ask Abraham to offer up Isaac as a sacrifice? Why do people say God is infinitely good? What is faith? Why do you call yourselves Jehovah’s witnesses? Who wrote the Bible? Thus for one hour, the students had the opportunity to ask questions and to receive the answers from the young Witness. In their exercise books on history, the students had to write down the lesson as: “Expose by student X on Jehovah’s witnesses.” For homework they had to answer the following questions: “Explain the origin of the name Jehovah’s witnesses. Is Jehovah infinitely good? Say why.” Thus, young publishers in following the good principles of God’s Word can give an excellent witness at school and thereby give others the possibility of knowing Jehovah and his teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is evident that the instruction given in the schools at the present time does not always correspond with that given in the Bible. This means that the children have to take a firm stand for the truth and show their appreciation of Jehovah’s instruction rather than that of the world. A few days before November 1 a school headmaster gave the students a recitation to learn in order to recite it before the war memorial. One morning the students were asked to recite this lesson in the classroom, one after the other. A young sister who was in that class realized that she could not do the same as the other students. She knew that Jehovah’s approval was more important than good marks that her teacher might give her. When her turn came to recite, she just remained seated, and thus she got no mark. In view of the fact that this sister always prepares her lessons well, the teacher made a point of asking her during the break why she had not prepared her recitation. She explained to him that she could not do a thing that was contrary to her conscience. Being a witness of Jehovah, she did not want to talk to the dead, who cannot hear, and what is more, there were words in the recitation that were contrary to the scriptures, such as “that God was wasting his time to create stars and flowers.” The teacher then decided to change the bad mark to a good one. The next day the whole class repeated the same recitation, but the young sister remained seated without receiving the teacher’s disapproval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By showing hospitality Jehovah’s witnesses sometimes have the opportunity of helping persons to come to a knowledge of the truth. (Heb. 13:2) The following example is proof of this: Returning to her home after conducting a home Bible study, a sister met the mother of a young woman with whom she conducted a study. Seeing that this woman was pale and trembling, and thinking that she was ill, the sister invited her into her home and showed her as much kindness as possible, even though this woman was opposed to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suddenly this lady burst into tears and said to the sister: “Why do you treat me like this? ... If only you knew . . .” The sister replied that as one of Jehovah’s witnesses she was trying to show love to her neighbor, and believing her to be sick, she was trying to give her some care. Then this woman cried out: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font9"> am not sick. I came here to kill you because you have stolen the love of my daughter who prefers God.” The sister explained to this woman that the Bible exhorts children to honor their parents and, rather than separate mother and daughter, the Bible only draws them nearer to each other. After a moment of reflection, the woman replied: “You deprive me of my daughter’s presence one afternoon each week, because you go to see her.” The sister then suggested that this lady attend the study, made an appointment for the following week and then took her home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The sister had some trouble at the beginning, but she did get some results. This woman is now a Witness and so is her husband. Being elderly, this sister cannot move around as she would like, but she makes herself useful taking care of her daughter’s children, thus allowing her daughter often to take up the vacation pioneer service. And what is more, her love of the truth has enabled her to help one of her neighbors who has also become a Kingdom publisher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Following the birth of their child, a brother and his wife were visited by a young Mussulman couple. The brother and his wife did not miss this opportunity to talk about the truth and to explain the work that is being accomplished by Jehovah’s visible organization. After a long conversation, the Mussulman couple left, taking with them the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font9"> An appointment was made and a study was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Four months later they both attended the circuit assembly, during which they expressed the desire to engage in the field service. The brothers were very happy to give them their assistance in this work. When they got back to their hometown, this man and his wife could not refrain from talking of the welcome and the hospitality that the brothers had shown them. The wife expressed a desire to progress in the truth, saying to her husband: “I also want to have an active part in the Kingdom Hall like Jehovah’s witnesses do.” These persons are continuing to make progress and are keenly studying the Scriptures, and we rejoice with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While engaged in the service as a vacation pioneer last April, a brother met a lady to whom he presented a magazine. This lady listened attentively without saying a word until he had finished his presentation of the message. She understood that he was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> witness of Jehovah and said to him in an affirmative tone: “You are a witness of Jehovah, in which case you should make out a subscription to your magazine for me. You must talk to me, I’m listening.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The publisher was so surprised he did not know what to say. Seeing his astonishment, the lady said: “I have been warned of your visit. My godfather, who is a witness of Jehovah, said to me about three years ago: ‘One day you will be visited by a brother. Let him make you out a subscription to the magazine and listen to what he had to say.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This lady did listen to the message of the Scriptures and is still doing so because she is studying the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </span><span class="font9">with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This person is very keen to learn more of the Scriptures. Each time the publisher comes to the end of the study, she will ask him to come a little earlier the next time, so that they can have more time to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TUNISIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Four years ago two publishers engaged in the witness work met a Catholic lady to whom they witnessed. This lady accepted the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font9"> and an appointment was made to begin a study of the Scriptures. In the meantime this lady went to see her priest, who counseled her to get rid of the Witnesses when they came to visit her. That is what she did, and thus the study was not started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">However, this person was very unhappy. She was continually tormented by the demons. She spoke about it to her priest, who came to her house on two occasions to bless it and thus to chase the spirits away. Although the priest did not forget to accept a dinar for each visit, this did not in any way remove the spirits. During another visit of this priest to this lady’s home, she told him that she had a copy of the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font9"> The priest lost no time in telling her that this was why she was being tormented, and advised her to get rid of the book. This she did, but this did not change matters for her. She received further counsel, such as using the cross to chase away the demons, but they still remained. Disappointed by her priest and the counsel he had given her, this lady decided to go to see those who talk with the spirits. These people gave her an object that she must wear and also some cream to anoint her face. This cream was supposed to prevent the spirits from kissing her during the night while she slept, as she had complained of this. But once again, she got no relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Beset with these difficulties, this lady was always trying to find a way out. One fine day she came face to face with one of the publishers she had met four years ago. This happened while she was doing her shopping. She was very happy to meet the Witness and asked the Witness to visit her at her home. This was done, and not only did she have the occasion to explain her problems but also to know God’s thoughts on such things. After a few visits and after hearing the explanations given by the Witnesses, this person came to understand that the only way to get rid of the demons was to accept the teachings of the Bible. A regular study of the Scriptures was begun, and the lady lost no time in getting her own copy of the Bible. At the end of a month’s study she began to feel the good effects of the study. She said that the demons no longer came every day, but only every two or three days. When she felt their presence, she would pray to Jehovah in Jesus’ name and they would leave her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This lady is experiencing today the great joy of knowing the freedom-giving message of God as published by Jehovah’s witnesses. The publishers who have visited this person have noticed that certain statues have been thrown out and that she no longer attends mass. This lady is now sure that the results obtained come from the true source, namely, Jehovah. Thus she prays to him each day, asking for wisdom to know and serve him better.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The tremendous economic growth in Germany has taken its toll with Jehovah’s witnesses and some have been stumbled. Even though the branch office, circuit and district servants are doing all they can to assist the brothers to appreciate their spiritual needs, still some are falling by the wayside. The words of Jesus are most appropriate in Germany and to God’s people everywhere: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you.” (Luke 21:34) Time takes its toll when one does not keep uppermost in his mind the joy of association and the joy of service. When one loses sight of spiritual things and stops seeking first the kingdom of God, it is not long before one turns away. Despite the fact that 2,869 persons symbolized their dedication to God in Germany this past year, there was an increase of only 300 publishers. These conditions may truly be another evidence that we are in the “last days,” very close to the old system’s end. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences from West Germany and from West Berlin, which comes under the direction of the Wiesbaden office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A good field of activity was found among the “guest workers.” At present there are 1.3 million Italians, Greeks, Spaniards, Turks and representatives of other nations in Germany. Their living here provides good service possibilities. Many have found, not only bread for their physical life, but also the bread that gives everlasting life. Among these “guest workers” are many humble, meek persons who are ready to accept the truth and take their stand on Jehovah’s side. To date five Greek, one Italian and one Spanish congregation have been organized. Besides that there are thirteen Greek, eighteen Italian, eight Spanish, one Portuguese and two Turkish isolated publisher groups already organized. An Italian circuit servant has already visited the Italian congregation and publisher groups and preparations are being made for an Italian circuit assembly. A circuit servant has been appointed for the Greek-speaking brothers, and in the next few weeks he will begin his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Showing how willingly these people accept the literature and magazines in their own language, we have the following report of a congregation servant. He always endeavours to have enough literature on hand and uses the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Preach the Word”</span><span class="font9"> in the service. He writes his personal experiences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I bought an Italian dictionary, prepared a short witness and learned it by heart. At home I prepared sets of booklets. Wherever I go, I always have something with me to offer, because I have learned that the ‘guest workers’ really appreciate it when someone on the street is ready to speak with them about the Bible. Many ‘guest workers’ are really ready to hear what the Bible has to say concerning the future. So with Jehovah’s help, I was able to place 84 books and Bibles, 715 booklets and 146 magazines in the various languages in the last few months.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following experience shows the joy that can come from a call on a “guest worker.” Nine months ago a Spanish family was located that accepted literature. After a number of visits the interest was kindled and a home Bible study was begun. This study set off a chain reaction. Bible studies were likewise begun with two other families of relatives. After only six months, thirteen persons stopped attending church services. Six persons have already started in field service and want to be baptized at the next opportunity. They are very zealous in the ministry. One father said: “Two or three hours a week in field service are too few!” He has already made arrangements to have a share in the service during the week. How deep an effect on their hearts the truth has had can be seen by the fact that only a few months of Bible study were needed to establish respect for Biblical principles. A young Spanish girl who was operated on and would have received a blood transfusion said: “I will not accept any blood. So if the operation cannot successfully be carried out, then I will have to sleep a little while, but Jehovah will wake me up again. Jesus was still young when he had to die.” All were happy that finally a surgeon was found who performed this operation without a blood transfusion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The situation for our brothers in the island city of West Berlin is similar to that in West Germany. Because of its special position the city is supported by West Germany, as can be seen by the high standard of living, but also found are negligence and unconcern by the inhabitants. This is naturally a test for our brothers, because on one side they must overcome the indifference of the people and on the other side remain watchful that they themselves do not lose sight of the goal. Actually some have become tired, and so the average number of publishers is one percent less than the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The following experience of a sister shows how patience leads to results and how practical it is to invite all family members to a home Bible study. She said: “My husband was very interested in God’s Word and so he studied the Bible with an older pioneer sister. I myself was a very strong Catholic and did not like it that my husband was visited once a week. Full of opposition, I would go into the kitchen and read a pocket book. It was often like that. Once when the sister saw what I was reading, she asked me tactfully if this reading material was upbuilding. I then remained in the room to hear what she studied with my husband in the Bible. But I remained ‘standoffish.’ Later I was invited to a talk in the congregation. I went and was impressed by the joyfulness and unity. When my husband went to the convention in Munich I went with him. Shortly before that I, too, had begun to study. When I saw the love and joy at this convention, I knew that I had chosen the right way.” This sister as well as her husband are thankful to the publishers that they showed much patience and tactfully helped them to learn the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Ghana experienced some very difficult conditions during the past service year. There was an overthrow of the former government, and this brought a measure of relief to the people. It was very evident, though, that quite a number of the brothers allowed the hardships of daily living brought about by the economic ruin on the country to dim their spiritual vision and to cause them to cease to endure. They failed to see the wisdom of Proverbs 11:4: “Valuable things will be of no benefit on the day of fury, but righteousness itself will deliver from death.” In their anxious pursuit of material necessities some allowed the spiritual values to be pushed aside and so became sluggish, and they slowed down in their service to Jehovah. However, the overseers are working hard to help restore those who have not shown the full measure of endurance that is needed to win out in the contest of our faith during these trying times. But let us read what the branch office in Ghana reports on Ghana, Ivory Coast and Togoland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Under the former government there had been considerable suppression of freedom of speech and religion. Many of our young publishers in school were faced with the issue of resisting the demands of worldly men who tried to force them to do acts of worship toward the national emblem. In 1964 two young schoolboys appeared before court on a charge of “insulting the national flag and emblem.” The district magistrate declared them guilty and stated: “The accused persons are immature ... As such they should not have allowed themselves to be hampered by religious scruples to do acts contrary to the laws of Ghana.” They were sentenced to three years in a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">borstal</span><span class="font9"> institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On February 24 of this year a military coup overthrew the former regime, and a breath of freedom blew across the land. Shortly after, on the 22d of April, our case came before the Supreme Court on appeal. The three justices declared: “No offence had been committed in law and it was the duty of the trial court to have acquitted and discharged the accused persons. . . . The convictions and sentences are quashed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are thankful to Jehovah for this fine victory, giving us a precedent upholding freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young student in school made good use of articles from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> in preparing to deliver essays before the class. As a result, he usually obtained high marks, and this caused other students to inquire as to where he obtained such fine information. He would point their attention to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> and encourage them to obtain copies. However, their objection was that our magazines are full of our doctrines, which are contrary to their beliefs. So the young brother was not having too much success distributing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One day a classmate asked the head teacher where he could find good information on current affairs and economic questions. Unhesitatingly, the head teacher said it would be found in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazine. He explained that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> had helped him and a number of his friends to pass examinations in banking recently and that he had been recommending </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font9">ever since. This caused the classmates of the young student to have a change of viewpoint, and he was able to start a magazine route right in school. Also, a Bible study was started with one of the boys showing good interest. They are studying together twice each week, after classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A publisher started home Bible studies with six different individuals in the same compound. Each one, in turn, dropped out for lack of interest. He started a study with the seventh person, a woman whose husband was not interested in the truth. As the study progressed, this woman expressed the desire to help her husband to learn the same good things. People in this area are accustomed to using charms to hold influence over others. So the publisher recommended the use of a “charm.” The woman looked surprised and asked if Jehovah’s witnesses use charms. The brother assured her this was a different kind of charm and told her she would need the following in preparing this special charm. A bucket of water, a sponge with soap and a towel; these would be for the bathroom. Then, a new hair comb, talcum powder and pomade for use after her husband had taken his bath. The final part to make the charm work is the use of the word “please” with a smile whenever she wanted to talk to the husband. To his question: “Have you ever used this kind of charm?” the woman said, “No.” He told her to use it regularly, and when the husband asked her about her change of conduct she should open the Bible to First Peter chapter three and let him read: “In like manner, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, in order that, if any are not obedient to the word, they may be won without a ’word through the conduct of their wives, because of having been eyewitnesses of your chaste conduct together with deep respect.” The woman applied the the suggestion, and it worked. The man became interested, and regular Bible studies were conducted with him and his wife together. Both are now dedicated servants of Jehovah, happy to be sharing the truth as a married couple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One happy father relates: “I am a man with many children and large family obligations that make it impossible for me to be a full-time preacher. Nevertheless, I have continually encouraged my children to look forward to full-time service as a career. One of my boys I encouraged to vacation pioneer during his school vacations. He did this consistently until he left school. I then encouraged him to take up regular pioneer service, which he did. The circuit servant suggested he accept an assignment where the need was great. By my continual encouragement, and by aiding him to remain in this assignment, my son has done very well and I am happy to see him setting such full-time service as his career in life. He is presently serving as a special pioneer at the age of eighteen years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">IVORY COAST &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,200,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Recently police broke into a Kingdom Hall and arrested a number of the servants, including the overseer. They were charged with practicing a religion not allowed in the country. Heavy fines were imposed following their trial. However, the brothers and interested persons continue to meet together to study the Bible and keep their faith strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While riding the bus a missionary and his wife redeemed the time by reading the latest magazines. A young man noticed </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and inquired if he could obtain copies for himself. This was quickly arranged. The bus was crowded, but the missionary was able to ask the young man’s address. He explained that his house number was 18, but he could not identify the street because it was unnamed. As the young man left the bus, the missionary wondered, Which one of these streets could be his? A week later the brother set off in search for this interested one. On the first street he found number 18, but it was not this house. Another street, another number 18, but wrong again. Finally, as he approached house 18 on yet another street, he noticed the very young man in the yard. The missionary was immediately recognized and warmly welcomed. After discussing </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> Bible sermon, the man readily subscribed for both </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> A study was immediately started and good progress has been made.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">As a result of Jehovah’s blessing on the diligent work of the Witnesses in Togoland, the word of God has kept on growing, and the number of disciples keeps multiplying. (Acts 6:7) The big news for the brothers was the announcement by the Society that, beginning with September 1, 1966, there would be a new branch office opened in Lome, the capital city. Everyone was pleased to receive this news, as it is an evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon the activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Catholic man began studying the Bible with a full-time minister, but his wife was reluctant to join in the study. In fact, she grew more and more opposed to the arrangement. Whenever the pioneer minister would arrive for the study, she would leave the house and sit under a nearby tree, complaining to all her friends about her husband’s conduct. Eventually, she even stopped talking to the man, but would only cook his food and put it on the table. The pioneer encouraged the man to read Matthew 10:34-37, where Jesus showed that even families would be divided over the truth of God’s Word. This proved to be a means of strengthening him. In time the man began to preach the good news from house to house. At the same time he patiently tried to win over his wife. He was helpful when she was cooking. He helped to bathe the children, gave her more money to buy food for the family and avoided quarreling with her. Finally, the wife began to see this change in her husband and listened to discussions of God’s Word. She was invited to a public talk, and she came and enjoyed it. Now the man’s wife has progressed to the point of attending and taking part in meetings, and recently she attended an assembly. Thus we can see that applying Bible principles in one’s daily life can prove very beneficial.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Every step of the way Jehovah’s witnesses have experienced protection and loving-kindness from the Almighty God, Jehovah. Recent political developments and malicious actions of the hierarchy of the Greek Orthodox Church have caused hardship to come upon many Christian witnesses of Jehovah in Greece. Yet, in spite of the many difficulties, day by day the ministers of the good news zealously continued their preaching work. The increase attained this year was reached even though many brothers left Greece to find better living conditions elsewhere. In this country that boasts of being the cradle of democracy, Jehovah’s witnesses are not allowed to have their own Kingdom Halls, nor are they allowed to enjoy large assemblies. Despite these restrictions on the work, excellent progress has been made and a marvelous witness given. Here are some experiences of our brothers in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At a town in southern Greece a businessman learned the truth with all his family. He made his home available for meetings and is now regularly sharing in the work from house to house. Sometime ago, while working </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> territory, he was arrested by a gendarme and taken to the police station. There the police officer asked him when he became an adherent of Jehovah, and the brother answered: &quot;In the last eight months.” “Now you will go to prison for the work you do,” said the officer. The brother answered: “We are used to hang our hat anywhere and have our blanket ready to spread anywhere; it is only in the priest’s garden that we don’t spread it.” “And which is the priest’s garden?” asked the officer. The brother explained to him about Babylon and the anti-Scriptural teachings of false religion. Finally, the officer set the brother free, when he became convinced that no law was violated by placing the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How careful a publisher must be not to pass by any house, as a “sheep” just may live there. This is shown by the following experience: In a village of Thessaly two brothers called at a house and knocked several times at the door, but nobody opened the door, although talk was heard inside. They were ready to leave, but one brother said to the other: &quot;Let us go back and knock again at the door. It may be some ‘sheep’ of Jehovah; why abandon it?” They went back and knocked again. This time the householder opened the door, received them gladly, took two magazines and expressed the desire to become a subscriber. The brothers called back in a few days and invited him to attend the circuit servant’s talk. The man rejoiced in what he heard and a Bible study was arranged with his family; now he is steadily advancing in knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Perseverance in serving interested people finally brings about blessed results, according to the report of a special pioneer: &quot;In a community of central Greece I was acquainted with the president of the community and spoke to him of the Kingdom message. But, owing to his position, this man did not show much eagerness to listen. Finally, he agreed to come to the Memorial talk, and then to a public talk entitled ‘Our Generation in Bible Prophecy.’ This talk aroused his keen interest, and, as a result, he invited me to his home to consider this important theme. At this first call there was also a theologian present whose object was to refute the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses. But he was unable to disprove the Scriptural proofs I showed him, so he got up and went away. The second time a doctor of medicine was present who tried to support the theory of evolution. But he, too, was unable to refute the Scriptural proofs I presented. Finally, the president of the community realized that Jehovah's witnesses have convictions based on the Holy Bible. A Bible study was arranged with his whole family, and now this president and five members of his family are publishers of God’s kingdom.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In many respects it seems that our brothers in the French-speaking territories of the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique and in South America’s French Guiana have not neglected “the house of our God.” Again the work has moved along very well in all three territories. All have gotten a deeper appreciation of the admonition of Paul contained in 1 Corinthians 15:58, which says: “Your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.” Truly it is not in vain when we see the rich blessing that Jehovah has poured out upon his people during the service year and the many experiences they have enjoyed in these three locations. Here are some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Faithfulness to Jehovah is always rewarded. During a recent circuit assembly a young publisher got baptized. He knew for some time that he would be called on to perform military service. To be fully ready for that coming test he immediately entered the vacation pioneer service. This strengthened his faith and his resolve to Jehovah to stay faithful during the test that suddenly arrived upon him. He made a declaration of his faith before the authorities and explained his Christian position in the matter. As a result, he was put into jail, alone in a cell. Then pressure started to be put on him, but he stayed faithful. Threats were uttered to him: “If you do not change your mind, you will be put in prison for at least two years. Moreover, you will be alone in a cell all that time, so think well—alone for two years!” The answer they got from this brother was: “Well, that is what you think, but I will not be alone as you say, not at all! Jehovah God will be with me and will strengthen me by his spirit.” They were quite surprised by his answer and left him. His firmness, calmness and good conduct impressed them, and, as a result, they started to show deep respect for him. They realised that nothing could change his decision to stay faithful to “his Jehovah,” as they said. Months went by and the time came for the most wonderful district assembly ever held, with its significant theme “God’s Sons of Liberty.” But what a surprise to see that brother present for the opening session! Yes, just the day before he was unexpectedly set free! Of course, the first one to be surprised was himself. During one of the sessions he told his experience. We did not know an officer was listening to the program. He was not noticed, as he was dressed as a civilian. After the session he went to the brother and warmly congratulated him for his faithfulness. Turning to the overseer of the congregation where the brother belongs, he said to him: “All your brother said is exactly true; all happened as he told us. I was in that affair. Here you have a man of value, worthy of respect, faithful to his God, firm in his decision. He knows what he wants, and when he has said no, it is no, and nothing can change his mind in that.” Then he continued, saying: “Because of his good Christian conduct and unbreakable decision, do you know what my wife said to me? She said, ‘Don’t think that you men have done that by your own will. No, but it is his God, Jehovah, who has done that for him in order for him to attend his convention. His God, Jehovah, is stronger than our god!’ ” He was visibly moved, and concluded by saying: “I have admiration for you, and if in the past I had had the chance to know what you know about God, I certainly would not be what I am today.” What a strong witness, is it not? Indeed, we can appreciate the great advantage of staying faithful to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Oftentimes through the Society’s publications or our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> we are advised to witness by letter to our relatives or friends that are far away or to take the opportunity when we write to mention in the letter some words about the good news or to enclose some tracts. This is just what a sister did, and she got very good results. She wrote some months ago to her sister-in-law, telling her about the good news and the wonderful hope she has. She encouraged her sister-in-law to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses in France. Some time went by without any answer, so the sister thought that her letter had not been delivered. But to her great joy and surprise, she recently received a reply, and here is what was written: “My dear sister, I was very happy about the Biblical counsel you sent me sometime ago in your letter, and I thank you very much for the various tracts you enclosed in that letter. I am very happy to tell you that I got in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses. A couple has paid me a visit, and since that time I am visited regularly. I study a book with them now. Be assured that I have a very keen interest in my lessons, and I am very glad. I have to tell you, too, that I am very happy you have chosen this way of life, because I know now it is the best!” No doubt that person will soon be a singer of praises of Jehovah, and all this because a few words were slipped into a letter by a Witness animated with the sincere desire to help her relatives with the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">During a recent circuit assembly the advice was given to visit, with a mature brother or the overseer, the husbands that are apparently not in favor of the truth when their wives start studying the Bible. A sister kept that in mind and applied it in a practical way. She said: “After a few back-calls I started a home Bible study with a very interested woman. Each time she was well prepared and I rejoiced in her good progress. But after a few months of study I noticed that her interest began to cool off. I asked what the reason was and I was told that after each study she had a hard time with her husband. He quarreled with her, pressuring her to quit studying the Bible. His main threat was: ‘I will separate from you if you persist in your study of the Bible with the Witnesses. We cannot have two chiefs in the home!’ I tried several times to get in touch with him and I did meet him in his home. He was polite with me but never wanted to listen to the message, so I understood that something else should be done. First, I exhorted his wife to show patience and kindness. Then, as advised during the circuit assembly, I went to our overseer and explained the situation to him and invited him to go with me to visit the man, which he gladly agreed to do. But before going I informed the man that my wish was to pay him a special visit in the company of the responsible one of our congregation, who would like to discuss with him a subject of interest. He agreed, and a rendezvous was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“When we arrived, he was ready to leave the home, but he postponed his project and kindly received us. Then the brother, who was well prepared, gave a good witness, explaining our work and the wonderful purposes of God toward mankind. The new book was presented to him and was accepted. Taking advantage of the situation, the brother tactfully asked to make a new rendezvous with him for the next week, to start to study the Bible with the help of the book. I was agreeably surprised to hear his answer: ‘Why not tomorrow?’ which was done, of course! Now, as a result of that special visit to that so-called ‘unbeliever,’ the study is progressing very well. He feels sorry not to have accepted the truth earlier. Needless to say, the happiest one is his wife, who was allowed to pursue her study with me. What joy was ours when she got baptized during the recent district assembly! Her husband said that he, too, hopes very soon to be a witness of the true God.” Is this not encouraging? Certainly! But why so? Simply because she applied in a practical manner what the visible organization of Jehovah had said, and now look at the blessing from Jehovah on that family! Because a simple visit was paid, the love of the truth, peace and happiness have taken root in that family.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Guatemala are happy to be able to preach openly and freely in all parts of the country. They have enjoyed a 6-percent increase in the average number of publishers during the past service year. They have twelve congregations in Guatemala City, where an international convention will be held in December of 1966. All the brothers there are speaking about the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Assemblea Internacional,</span><span class="font10"> and it appears that many brothers from other countries will be visiting Guatemala during this new service year. Jehovah’s witnesses in Guatemala enjoyed their best year in bound-book distribution to date, due to having the new publication</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> in the Spanish language. Many new Bible studies were started, and the brothers are looking to the new service year with keen anticipation of greater increase. Here are a few experiences as reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A twenty-three-year-old special pioneer brother writes: “The joy and satisfaction of serving Jehovah overwhelms me, and I am impelled to write this letter of deep appreciation. I am so very happy to be a special pioneer; I never thought that it could really be. Although I was raised in a Christian home and trained to ‘walk in the way,’ when I was about thirteen years old I became absorbed in sports and gave little attention to the truth. Nevertheless, in my mind there was always the idea of the truth and when I did something incorrect, such as trying to smoke or drink, I became afraid and fearful to do wrong. The servants tried to revive my interest, but when I attended a circuit assembly I felt like an intruder and guilty. Then an enthusiastic special pioneer was assigned as our overseer and he was able to reach me by speaking of the assurance of a good and happy future by serving God. I repented and began attending all meetings and service arrangements, and I asked Jehovah for his mercy and his spirit. As I progressed I felt the impulse to be a useful servant of Jehovah and became a pioneer in time. About this time the brother who had helped me so very much became ill, and six days after receiving my pioneer appointment he died suddenly, and I was assigned to be congregation overseer. It was a bitter blow to me, and I felt upset and confused and quite discouraged at the loss of this brother who had given me courage and the impulse to serve Jehovah. But even in my sadness I was reminded of Paul’s words: ‘When I am weak, then I am powerful.’ I realized as never before that all depends upon Jehovah. Now I know that being a full-time minister is our real goal in life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister living in an isolated town had become inactive due to her husband’s opposition to the brothers’ visiting her home. She was spiritually weak. When the brothers would visit her she would be frightened because her husband was jealous, and she asked the brothers not to visit her for fear that her husband would do them harm. When a new overseer visited her she was not anxious to invite him in, but on the second visit she explained why. The overseer spent three hours talking to her of her responsibility to Jehovah and explained that God had made woman as a “helper” for man and not as a slave. The sister was moved by the application of God’s Word to her problem, and when her husband returned she was prepared. She told him: “Well, Pharaoh, the chains in which you have held me have been broken, and you must let Jehovah’s people go free.” Then she continued to explain her position and determination. The husband said not a word but left the house. From that time onward she fulfilled her service to Jehovah with little opposition, although he continued to be jealous. Not long after that the husband died, and she was left with the care of eleven children. She became even more active, conducting various home Bible studies, averaging twenty-five hours a month and placing many magazines. Now a weekly group study is held in her home. So let us never think that some who have become inactive are beyond the reach of help from Jehovah through his organization. Let us, rather, try to imitate those who constantly have success in helping inactive ones by preparing well and by letting God’s Word speak with boldness to those who long to be among “God’s sons of liberty.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses have had a very busy and happy year. Although all the people kept living where they were, they no longer were in the same country. In the month of May everyone in the land found out that he was no longer living in British Guiana, but he was now living in Guyana. But the change of name did not change the people. They were the same people in every way as before, people who should hear the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. All are in great need of God’s Word, and it is the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses in every land to take the Bible message to them whatever the nation’s name is. Here are some experiences that the branch servant from Guyana sends in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother who serves as a prison officer was summoned to a staff meeting about a week before the independence date. Assignments were being made for all available officers to be on hand for the raising of the new flag on May 26. It was indicated that all the men would be required to take an active part in hoisting the flag, saluting it, marching, and so forth. The brother reported: “When I asked if I could be assigned any other duties apart from the flag-raising ceremony, the chairman answered, ‘This is a duty detail and has nothing to do with your religion.’ When I stated clearly my Bible-based position, another officer spoke up, arguing that others might also want to do as they pleased and not take part. As the meeting became noisier, the chairman raised his hands high and said: ‘Gentlemen, this is off the record, but if I could hold the reigns of government for ten minutes, I would put all of Jehovah’s witnesses on an island and then we’d see if they wouldn’t have to form a government of their own!’ Then he assured the brother that he could not be excused from the flag duties, parade, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I prayed to Jehovah for strength and direction. Two days later when I appeared for my physical examination by the prison doctor, you can imagine my surprise when he informed me: ‘I am very sorry, but you will have to rest awhile due to hypertension. You will not work for eight days. I will give you sick leave.’ So I spent the critical days of the independence celebrations in my home, witnessing to various callers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Present at our district assembly and working diligently in the refreshment department was a “stranger,” an East Indian youth. A circuit servant tells us more about him: “At my last visit to the Black Bush area I met a young man of seventeen. He showed unusual interest in the Bible, asking several questions that had puzzled him because he had not received satisfying answers from another religious organization. One of these questions was: ‘What has become of the ark of the covenant?’ He was shown in the Scriptures that it could not be in heaven as other religionists had told him. Following through on the Society’s suggestion, I started a study on that first call; in fact, I conducted three studies with him that week. Due to his enthusiasm, nine persons attended one of the studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“After the visit I kept in contact with him by writing several letters to him, to which he sent encouraging replies. I observed his progress from such expressions as ‘Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,’ ‘May Jehovah’s rich blessings . . . ,’ ‘I try to interest my neighbors in the good news,’ and so forth. I invited him to the ‘God’s Sons of Liberty’ District Assembly, and he was very much impressed by what he saw and heard. He accompanied a brother in the field service during the assembly and later saw some persons present whom he had invited. When he left, he said, ‘I wish to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses on my arrival home.’ Now I am happy to see him conducting a home Bible study with his brother and witnessing to neighbors. I had the joy of working with him in the ministry and starting some more studies. So, within a period of three and a half months, he has made a fine start in serving Jehovah. This studious young man plans to be baptized soon and hopes never to miss any of our assemblies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HAITI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,384,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">There have been quite a few internal difficulties among the brothers in Haiti, but despite unfaithfulness on the part of some and the renouncing of the truth even by a prominent overseer, Jehovah’s witnesses in Haiti have continued to make a very good impression in the eyes of those righteously disposed and they will continue to do so, preaching the good news of the Kingdom. We find in this land of Haiti that people are breaking away from Babylonish false religion the same as in other countries, as the truth brings liberty and freedom to those having ears to hear. Some interesting experiences have been received from Haiti, which show zeal on the part of those who are hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A special pioneer working in a small town in the south related that in the house-to-house ministry he met a very devoted Catholic lady who was completely hostile to the truth. Seeing the pioneer at her door, she begged him to leave immediately so that the worst would not happen. The pioneer withdrew in an amiable way, leaving a good impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After a few days a stranger who had been sent by the woman came to see the brother to congratulate him on the fine attitude he had shown when calling on her. Seizing the opportunity, the brother returned to the house. There he met the same woman as well as her husband and children. The brother gave the sermon and, finding he had only his own copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet, began a study with it and prom-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ised the people he would bring each his own copy at an opportune time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When he returned for the second visit, the husband already had a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet and explained that he had walked a distance of six kilometers to obtain it from another Witness. After the final review of the lesson the woman asked if the pioneer could come every day. Since then the study has been conducted twice a week. At the present time this couple have left Catholicism, are participating in the proclamation of the Kingdom, attending all the meetings, taking part in the Theocratic Ministry School and are nourishing the hope of being baptized at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An overseer was informed by his Bible student that the priest had taken his book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font9">during religious instruction on the pretext that the book was filled with errors. The overseer decided that while doing the territory around the presbytery he would also go to see the priest. Arriving at the presbytery with his Bible student, he met a group of thirty parishioners who had come to prepare a manger for the Christmas holidays. When the conversation began, the group left their work for a moment to listen to what was being said. The priest, in answering a question put to him, exclaimed: “You say that hell is a place of rest in hope; there is one error.” The overseer then asked: “Could you tell me the Hebrew and Greek terms from which the French word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">enfer (hell)</span><span class="font9"> is translated?” The priest stood there for two minutes with his mouth agape while the others waited to hear what he would say. Then the brother went on to explain the meaning of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Hades.</span><span class="font9"> Taking the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font9"> from his briefcase, he read the extract from page 100, paragraph 9 (page 91, in English): “The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia . . </span><span class="font9">. under the word ‘Hell’, states: ‘Holy Writ seems to indicate that hell is within the earth,’ ” and went on to say that Jesus was in hell and was resurrected from the dead the third day, according to the “Apostles’ Creed.” He next said to the priest: “In the light of these declarations presented in your own books, where is hell? Where was it that, according to your own teachings, Jesus stayed for three days?” The audience composed of faithful Catholics cried out in full voice: “In the tomb, in the earth.” The Bible student then told the priest: “For a long time you have held me back, to hinder me from associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, isn’t that so, Father? Well, from this moment on, there will be no more holding back for me.” Since that time he has been attending all the meetings and takes part in the ministry and is making progress theocratically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HAWAII &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;771,693</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,306 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 335</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The dangerous trend toward materialism, irregularity and inactivity was noted among some of the Hawaiian brothers during the past year, much like the trend in other countries of the earth. When there is an atmosphere of indifference toward service privileges and a neglect of spirituality, some slow down their activity. It is observed in some cases that both parents and children are showing the spirit of the Laodiceans. As mentioned at Revelation 3:15, 16, they are neither hot nor cold in their zeal for the service of Jehovah. The branch servant in Hawaii says that in view of this there has been more emphasis placed on a daily study of the Bible, the reading of the daily text and a family study of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> week by week. Circuit servants have given good attention to the congregation publishers, and especially those who have become indifferent. They have tried to help those who have tended to laxness in their spirituality, and there appears to be some reversing of this tendency among God’s people. There were 102 publishers who were reactivated during the year, and this, of course, brought joy to the hearts of all Jehovah’s witnesses. The branch office in Honolulu looks after the work in the Hawaiian Islands and also the Marshall Islands. Here are some experiences from each group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Without doubt one of the year’s highlights in joy and spiritual upbuilding was the fine District Assembly program. Three district assemblies were held this year, with a total of 3,175 attending the public talk in English, 374 in Japanese and Iloko, and a total of 3,073 attended the Jeremiah demonstration. Jehovah certainly blessed us with an abundance of “spiritual food in due season” and fine encouragement to endure in our service to Jehovah. We express gratitude for the new releases at the assemblies and a new circuit servant schedule giving more attention to aiding the weaker brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One sister started a study with a lady who was a Mormon and whose husband was an opposed Catholic. As she learned new truths she eagerly shared them with her husband, but this brought much opposition. Despite these many problems, she began to attend the meetings whenever her husband was not home, always bringing her children with her. Opposition developed to the point where she asked him to call his Catholic priest so he could help them answer their questions from the Bible, and perhaps they would be able to live a more peaceful life together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two sisters were present for this discussion. When the priest came, he had a large bag filled with books, but no Bible! They loaned him a Catholic Bible. The lady of the house was prepared with a list of questions and directed them to the priest, while her husband hardly spoke, not having any knowledge of his Catholic beliefs or the Bible. Not being able to give Biblical answers from his own version of the Bible, the priest finally admitted that in the theological seminaries they were not taught the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The lady of the house again repeated the same questions to the sisters, who gave Scriptural answers from the Catholic Bible. This amazed the priest. One scripture, for example, was 1 Corinthians 5:11-13, where it says that fornicators, drunkards and idolaters are to be removed from the congregation. He asked: “What do you mean ‘removed from the congregation’?” They explained that one who willfully practices such wickedness must be disfellowshiped or excommunicated from the congregation. He said: “Wait a minute, let me read that for myself.” After reading it himself, he commented, scratching his head: “I didn’t know that in my Catholic Bible it said that.” The priest marveled at the knowledge the sisters had of the Catholic Bible and wanted to know how they obtained such Bible knowledge. They pointed out how weekly studies were held free of charge for one hour, using the Bible as the main textbook while at the same time using the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font9"> He asked that we deliver this Bible-study aid to his home the following day and expressed a desire to have a weekly study. The discussion lasted over three hours, and the poor husband was bewildered at the priest’s ignorance of the Bible, displaying this by silence throughout most of the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The next day one of the sisters placed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font9"> book with the priest, but he never kept his Bible study appointment. For the next two weeks in church he reportedly told the congregation that when Jehovah’s witnesses come to your door, “listen to them, for they have the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The article “God Is Alive,” in the April 8 issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazine was a very timely subject, discussed by many. For example, one day in social studies class at school one of our young brothers had an opportunity to do incidental witnessing when the class entered into a discussion on the topic “Is God Dead?” The class consisted of thirteen Catholics, seven Protestants, three Buddhists and one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The teacher asked each of the students if he believed there was a God. He was surprised to find out that only </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font9"> out of the whole class believed there was a God. He asked the class why they did not believe there was a God. One girl asked: “If there is a God, why can’t we see him?” The young brother raised his hand, telling her that no man can see God and live. He also told her that you do not have to see something to believe. For example, he explained, consider the planet Pluto. Though the scientists previously could not see this planet, they believed it existed by detecting its effects on other planets. The next day he took some copies of the April 8 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> to class, placing them with his teacher and some of his classmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MARSHALL ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18,205</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,023</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the end of the service year the isolated group of publishers in the Marshalls are making fine progress toward maturity. This group of five publishers and two missionaries are now conducting seventy-three Bible studies. Rather than starting new studies, they invite newly interested ones to attend studies already in operation. As a result, the average attendance at studies is from four to seven persons, representing from one to three families. Eleven persons have enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School and twenty-three persons attend, on the average. At least four men are advancing rapidly toward dedication and baptism. During the year the congregation book study attendance rose from five to nineteen persons. They had a similar increase in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study attendance. The prospects for forming a new congregation during the coming service year looked very encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The two missionaries used their vacation time to take a trip to eight of the outer islands and atolls. On the same boat was the head minister for the Protestant church, an American. They wondered what effect his visit to these islands would have upon their efforts to comfort these humble people with the Kingdom good news. Rather than his being a hindrance to their efforts, his presence enabled the natives to see clearly the contrast between the missionaries of Jehovah’s witnesses and those of Babylon the Great. The brothers preached to the natives in their dialect from early morning till late at night, answering their Bible questions. The Protestant minister could not speak any Marshallese, though he has been in the islands over three years. He only held one meeting at the local church and spent the rest of his time sight-seeing and taking pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The interest of these people was so great that, though they could not read English, they wanted the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book just to look at the pictures and look up the scriptures in their Marshallese Bible. Though two cartons of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book were taken along as well as full book bags, it soon became clear that the books would have to be rationed in order to have enough to go around at all the islands. Persons contacted were so hungry for the truth that they begged the missionaries to stay a couple of months until the next ship came in. “Don’t worry about food or a place to stay; we will take care of you and you can teach us more of these wonderful things from the Bible,” they would say. The missionaries promised to return in the future, reluctantly leaving these sheeplike people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The outstanding event of the year was when the circuit servant visited these islands in February. The film “Divine Will International Assembly” was shown, with a total of 2,550 in attendance. Many commented on the organization and the love shown. Questions were asked on baptism and what one has to do to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. It was a real encouragement to the many interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HONDURAS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,068,083</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 900 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9">1 </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to 2,298</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in this Spanish-speaking country have had their best year in Jehovah’s service in many respects. The release of the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> certainly stirred up the publishers. A new all-time peak in publishers was reached, and they had an average of 780 Witnesses in the field every month throughout the year. The highest number of hours ever devoted to the field service in Honduras was reported this past year. There was an increase in the number of subscriptions obtained and in the distribution of individual copies of the magazines. They also moved ahead in the number of home Bible studies conducted. So our brothers are rejoicing. Now they are looking forward to a fine assembly in Tegucigalpa in December. The branch servant gives us some interesting reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Illustrating the need to use the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> in conducting our Bible studies, as suggested by the Society, is the following experience. A sister conducting a Bible study with a family in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font9"> book knew that she should now follow through on the suggestion to change over to the new book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie,’</span><span class="font9"> as it was “meat in due season” also for her Bible student. The family at first did not want to make the change, especially the father, but the change was made. As soon as the study began in the new book you could see the enthusiasm of the family grow as they studied its up-to-date contents. The father, who had previously opposed the idea, was so overjoyed with the book that he ordered fourteen of them and placed them with his friends and companions at work. They are now regular meeting at-tenders, the entire family participating in the field ministry. Several have already joined the Theocratic Ministry School, and the others have expressed their desire to do so. It is a joy to see their zeal increase as they continue to delve into the book’s contents. We, too, should be quick to see that our Bible studies are properly cared for according to the instructions from Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The working of isolated territory was given special attention during the past year, and we could see Jehovah’s blessing upon the arrangement and on those who made special efforts to visit these people that are seldom visited. Hundreds of books were placed, one circuit servant placing 117 books and obtaining 40 subscriptions in one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HONG KONG &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,700,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 259 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 14,286</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How true it is that the witnesses of Jehovah have a message of real hope and comfort for the people of all the earth! This message reaches out to Hong Kong, too, and the brothers and sisters there are working diligently to get the good news of the Kingdom to the Chinese population. The majority of the people, however, are not interested in this message, for they are too concerned with the cares of this life, and they do not stop to listen when the truth is presented to them. Those that do are very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Great changes are taking place in Hong Kong. Modern concrete skyscrapers are replacing the old Chinese-style buildings, making Hong Kong look like a modern city. Everyone is busy with the things of this life. The current prosperity that exists has not brought real joy and happiness to the people. During the past year mobs of young people have taken to the streets. Rioting has caused much damage to property. The younger generation in particular is distressed and feels that there is no real hope for the future. It is evident that Jehovah’s witnesses still have a great work to do in Hong Kong among the Chinese-speaking people. The branch servant there gives us a few experiences on Hong Kong and Macao.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An overseer reports about his visit with the circuit servant to a young publisher who had become inactive. Briefly they helped this young man to recall the blessings that would come in God’s righteous new order. Yes, he believed and wanted to live in that righteous new order, but he was too busy with his work. It was pointed out to him that if he wished to get life he must make a sacrifice. A schedule was suggested whereby he study with one of the special pioneers at eight o’clock in the morning one week and at the same time the following week he could go into the service. The overseer now reports that he has made the necessary sacrifice and has been most impressed with the love and patience shown by the brothers who have helped him. He is an active publisher again and attends the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Chinese New Year is the one time in the year when everything comes to a stop for about three days and all celebrate the occasion with feasting. All are in a happy frame of mind. The brothers take advantage of this holiday period to do special magazine work, and last year the results were excellent. Many people were contacted whom we never meet ordinarily and they accepted copies of the magazines. One congregation of 32 publishers placed 1,097 magazines in an area seldom worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MACAO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;375,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 53,571</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This small Portuguese colony is just seven square miles in area and lies right at the tip of a peninsula on the South China coast. It is to this colony that many Chinese flee from the Communist mainland in search of something better. So the little group of publishers in Macao meet many Chinese people and are able to present the only message of hope and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One sister called on a man who had lost all faith in God. He lacked understanding as to the reason for the existing conditions and hardships. A study was established and after a few months he regained his faith in God. He then revealed that he had thought of ending his life, but the publisher had called just in time and had given him real hope. He made good progress in knowledge and understanding and then began preaching the good news himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ICELAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;194,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 98 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,980</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We think of Iceland as a cold country, and it is, but Jehovah’s witnesses are warmhearted and anxious to bring the truth to all who will hear. They made remarkable progress during the year and had a 15-percent increase in publishers. The 92 regular publishers throughout the country did very fine work in the distribution of bound books and in getting home Bible studies started. Here is the report by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We appreciate the new arrangement providing for a full-time circuit servant who will be able to visit, not only the three congregations, but also the isolated publishers, regularly three times a year so that they can be strengthened and built up to carry their load of responsibility faithfully. As he does not have places enough to visit in order to keep busy all the time, he also goes to other territories not presently worked to do some real pioneer work and open up the way there so that later on pioneers can be assigned to such places. This arrangement has already done much good, and all the brothers are very thankful for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During this service year the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book was received in Icelandic. It had been awaited for a long time and was received with enthusiasm by the brothers, who showed their appreciation for it by placing a total of 964 the first month we had it and 908 the next, thus placing in two months’ time more books than they did in all of 1965! The public responded very well, and in many territories it could truly be said that the only calls where no books were placed were the not-at-homes. As one lady said about the book: “This is what I have been waiting for and what we all need.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">INDIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 490,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2,226 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 220,126</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The country of India has certainly had its share of the woes that have affected the entire world. The struggle to live has caused many to use the difficult times as a reason for all sorts of violence and disturbances in many parts of India. The worsening economic conditions have had their effect upon many of Jehovah’s witnesses too. However, the work in India has moved ahead during the year, and it is a pleasure to report that once again India has had an increase in publishers. It seems that year by year conditions are getting more difficult, but the Christian witnesses of Jehovah in this vast land are doing all they can under the circumstances, and Jehovah is blessing them. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An effort was made through the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font9">to boost family Bible reading and study. One day two children of Jehovah’s witnesses, aged six and eight, were attending school when their class was taken to pay homage to a statue. These two children refused to do what the other children were doing, and, when questioned by the Roman Catholic priest, the younger one answered: “In the Bible it says, ‘Little children, guard yourselves from idols,’ ” and, though pressure was brought to bear on them by the priest, they still refused to bow down to the statue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a predominantly Roman Catholic village a family was subjected to much ridicule because they were Jehovah’s witnesses. The priest visited the home and found only a girl aged fourteen at home. Asked why she did not attend church, she replied: “It is written in the Bible, ‘The Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands.’ ” The priest questioned that such a statement was in the Bible. A girl of fourteen showed him where.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have not had many problems over blood transfusion in India, but two very interesting ones occurred during the past year. One involved a brother who died as a result of a malignant cancer. The doctors had refused to operate because of his refusal to take a blood transfusion, and when he died the local cemetery owners, being Roman Catholic, refused to allow burial unless the deceased’s wife gave a written apology for the sins of her husband. This she was unwilling to do. The body was eventually buried in another cemetery through the cooperation of the management of the firm where the brother had been employed. This incident evoked so much discussion in the locality that a local newspaper published a report severely criticizing the local religionists for their action, stating: “His sin: Joining the Bible Society.” The other case involving blood transfusion was where a special pioneer sister refused a transfusion, and the hospital refused to proceed with her case unless she and her husband signed a declaration that gave the hospital authorities liberty to treat the case as they wished. The sister was removed to another town, where she was successfully operated upon without the use of blood transfusion. An excellent example was thus set by our special pioneers for the encouragement of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">India remains a vast country where the need is very great. It may astound some to know that here in India there are dedicated brothers who do not even possess the Bible in their own language. This is in the province of Goa, where the Portuguese Roman Catholic Church has held sway for centuries. Their local language is known as Konkani, and as yet the Bible is not published in this language. Some Gospel portions have been published by some Protestant organizations, but that is about all the people have had access to unless they read English or some Indian language. We now have pioneers working in Goa, and last year they placed several hundred bound books and obtained many subscriptions for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font9">The message of the Kingdom is at last being published in Goa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">INDONESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 105,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,426 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 73,633</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The service year just past proved to be a very turbulent one in Indonesia. The office in Djakarta has had a real problem trying to keep in touch with all the brothers in the islands. This has been due to the lack of communications and poor transportation facilities. However, the circuit servants have been getting to the brothers and giving them the necessary encouragement. Despite conditions in the country, which created problems for Jehovah’s witnesses, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness these servants of God came through strengthened in faith. It appeared, though, that at the end of the service year conditions were such that they might enjoy greater freedom in preaching in the future. In the early part of the service year the situation was building up toward an attempt by Communists to take over the country, and the brothers were certainly put under great pressure in many parts of the nation with regard to neutrality. Here are some of the experiences reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the beginning of October the Communists made their final push, expecting that it would put them in full control. Their attempt failed. Captured documents show that the Communists planned a wholesale murder of all people of influence opposed to their ideology, had their coup succeeded. Many of our brothers, particularly the servants in almost every congregation, were listed for liquidation. Most of them were near the top of the list. It was reported to us that the Bethel family headed the list of religious leaders to be liquidated in our area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the failure of the coup there was a fierce reaction against the Communists and a great slaughter of them, led primarily by the religious groups. Those religious groups opposed to Jehovah’s witnesses attempted to use this situation to crush Jehovah’s witnesses in some areas. There were several mob attacks on the brothers, and other difficulties were caused for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the island of Sumba our opposers have made a song against us with the theme “These devils are our enemies.” Groups of people gather and chant this insulting song when the brothers try to work certain areas. All the brothers there are well known and when they pass down the road on their daily business, people sing this song at them. The circuit servant was recently followed for several kilometers from one village to the next by a teacher and his students chanting this song against him the whole way. The brothers are not dismayed by this treatment. They have stood firm and boldly pressed on, until they have become almost proverbial for their endurance. People there say: “Jehovah’s witnesses are like nails. The more you hammer them the deeper they enter in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On Sumba Island a young man began to study the truth. His father violently opposed him, beat him and dismissed him from the home. Later, the father was arrested as a suspected Communist sympathizer. In prison those arrested in this campaign were discussing the cruel treatment they had received from the religious groups and making derogatory remarks about religion in general. One of the prisoners said: “There was one religion, though, that did not join in crushing us, that new religion called Jehovah’s witnesses. They are neutral in all political matters. They are hated and persecuted everywhere, but they are the only ones that show love for their enemies, even those that persecute them.” The father began thinking things over and realized that it was for this religion that he had beaten his son and thrown him out of the house. He was later cleared of complicity in the Communist plot and, when walking home from the jail after his release, he met his Witness son on the road. He said: “Please, bring a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses to see me right away. I want to talk about your religion.” A study was arranged with the whole family, and the father and son were reunited. Within six months the father and the whole family became publishers, and the father made his house available for congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From the island of Sumatra comes </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> report of the effort made by a sister to attend a district assembly, the journey requiring a two-day bus trip each way. The sister, who was formerly a Buddhist, has seven children and an opposed husband, who was not willing to provide money for his wife to attend the assembly. The wife saved a few rupiahs each day from her housekeeping money and bought ingredients for making cakes. By selling cakes every day for a couple of months she made enough money to cover her trip to the assembly. This sister, by training her children well to assist in the home, is able to be out in the service several times a week and attend all meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,606,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 112 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 23,268</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Israel Jehovah’s witnesses had a very successful year. They found a number of newly interested persons who began to associate and who have gone ahead in preaching the good news. One of the big problems in the land of Israel is the language barrier. There are so many different tongues spoken in the country that when the publishers go from home to home they must carry literature with them in many different languages. If they are carrying the right languages with them, often they will have good success. The problem then is to find someone to study with those who have taken the literature in languages other than what the publisher speaks. While there is a common tongue for the country, not everyone knows it. It is good to report that the brothers in Israel enjoyed an 11-percent growth during the year. Here are some of the experiences that were sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A highlight of the year was the opening of a meeting hall for the Haifa Congregation, thus providing them with facilities for combined and central meetings in place of scattered homes and cramped conditions. The hall also provided suitable facilities for the opening days of the assembly last month. This provision has already had a good effect on the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been heartwarming to the local congregation to see the sheeplike response and fine stand taken by one new sister. Contacted in the house-to-house ministry, she recognized the information in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> as “the truth” and was ready to start a study on the first return visit. Within a few days she started regular attendance at the meetings, coming early to help with tidying the hall and to enjoy the association with the brothers. She met and cheerfully surmounted considerable difficulty at home by taking extra care to fulfill her home duties without neglect. Then within three or four months she asked if she could share in the ministry. Now she has the added joy of seeing her son also sharing in the field service and her husband regularly at the meetings. They are a happy family and manifest warm hospitality to brothers who visit their humble home. She is becoming one of the pillars of the congregation, now calling around to take out in the service the sister who originally called at her door with the magazines!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The profound effect that one magazine can have was seen in othei’ cases this year. One lady accepted a magazine for her son to read. In this case no return call was made right away so the young man wrote to the branch office requesting a subscription for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and expressing his interest. Despite his orthodox religious upbringing, the material in the literature appealed to him as quite different from Christendom’s approach to the Scriptures. A study was immediately started with him, and soon he expressed belief in the Messiahship of Jesus, the mortality of the human soul, the nearness of the new system of things and other points. Besides this, his mother and sisters are also studying, their interest stirred by his enthusiasm for the new things that he has been learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 53,129,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 10,278 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,169</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The servants of Jehovah in Italy have appreciated the privilege that has been theirs to serve God and they have had a fine time doing the ingathering work. When you compare the 9,798 regular publishers in the field this year with the work done ten years ago when there were 3,229, you can appreciate how well the work has progressed throughout Italy. A few months after the start of the service year the Italian publishers were provided with the new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> in Italian. It was received with great joy and given an excellent distribution. This has been the greatest year in bound-book distribution Italy has ever had, and because of this many new Bible studies were started. The brothers in Italy expect to reap excellent results in the year ahead too. Here <a name="bookmark163"></a><a name="bookmark164"></a>are some experiences that were sent in by the branch servant regarding Italy and Libya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By using strategy a witness can be given even in a difficult territory, as seen by the experience of a congregation where the brothers had to preach in a very hostile town in their territory. This was a town of 6,000 inhabitants, and every time the brothers went there to preach many of the women and even the men of the town would round up the boys and encourage them to follow the publishers, whistling at them and making much racket. Thus after a few minutes the brothers were forced to quit and go on to another town. In an endeavor to give at least one complete witness to all the inhabitants of this town the brothers decided to preach there only on very rainy days, in the hope that they would not be bothered by the young folk of the town. They noticed that not only the boys but also the men and women of the town were not willing to get themselves wet in order to disturb the publishers. In this way a good witness was given. Interested persons were found. New Bible studies were started. Now, not only is there a blossoming congregation in this small town, but the preaching work is done even on sunny days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That a gentle answer calms anger is demonstrated by this experience of a special pioneer. He was preaching from house to house in an apartment building and was giving a sermon to a kind lady when he heard some loud shouts from the floor below. A woman was yelling: “Go away! Return to the church! Return to the pope!” Not being able to continue his sermon because of the noise, he decided to go downstairs to talk to this lady. Kindly and calmly he asked her: “Are you sure, Madam, that Peter was in Rome?” The lady replied that she was certain of it. So he asked her to get her Bible and invited her to open it to 1 Peter 5:13. It was clearly pointed out that Peter wrote this letter from Babylon and not from Rome. Then he had her read Romans 16:8-27, and the lady was able to note that the apostle Paul sent greetings to several Christian brothers but did not mention Peter, who, according to the Catholic church, was in Rome at that time. After this brief conversation the lady had him come into her living room, where he was able to give her a complete witness about the truth. She readily accepted the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book. An appointment was made for a return call. After two back-calls, a home Bible study was started. The lady proceeded to take all the books of the Society and subscribed for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> After just a few months of study this lady began attending meetings and started preaching the good news of the Kingdom to others. Having decided to dedicate her life to Jehovah, she symbolized her dedication by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,650,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 43 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 38,372</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah is worthy of all praise for the peaceful service activity carried on despite the ban on the work. The only negative aspect is the twofold decision issued by the Supreme Court rejecting the appeal for legal recognition of the Society and the request to reconsider the unjust decision regarding the expulsion of the former Tripoli Congregation overseer in 1959. Nonetheless, the brothers are in high spirits as the ministry continues to be done in the European communities and principally among the Italian population. The economic prosperity has caused materialism to become a real danger, but efforts have been made to assist the brothers in their fight against this new pitfall. Most of the time is dedicated to extending the good news to interested persons and aiding them to gain more knowledge of God’s Word. When these interested persons understand the message they do not hesitate to talk favorably about it. Considering the number of publishers, one could conclude that there has been no progress in Libya, but such is not the case, as there have been new publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">JAMAICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,811,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5,324 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 340</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Jamaican brothers were pleased to contribute to the worldwide ministry during the past year. They appreciate that “Jehovah himself will bless his people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11) They unselfishly invite others to enjoy the peaceful conditions of Jehovah’s organization. What a glorious privilege it is to point the people of the world to God’s Word! It takes effort, it takes hard work, but Jehovah gives the reward. Here are a few experiences that have taken place in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Rich blessings have come to many publishers that have engaged in the ministry for a period of time before the congregation book study each week. This is a regular practice with many of the publishers here in Jamaica. Because the circuit servant encouraged participation in this service, a sister eventually followed up his suggestion. She placed a few magazines and had some interesting discussions, which encouraged her to do the same thing the following week. The more she engaged in the ministry before the study, the more she enjoyed it, and it eventually became a regular routine with her. Calling at the homes of the people in magazine work has led to some fine back-calls and home Bible studies. As an outgrowth of these calls three fleshly sisters and an interested person are now attending meetings regularly. How long would it have taken for these four people to be found if it had not been for prestudy work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is natural for a married person in the truth to want to assist his unbelieving mate to learn of Jehovah’s purposes. An unbeliever made it plain to his wife that he did not want her to discuss her religion with him and that no matter what she had to say about her religion it would go in one ear and out the other. The sister knew that once her husband took an interest in the Bible, he would appreciate the knowledge gained, and at a circuit assembly encouragement was given for persons in the truth to conduct home Bible studies with their unbelieving mates. After prayer and meditation on this matter, the sister recommended to her husband that they read just the Bible together. She would do the reading and would humbly ask him for the meaning of various texts discussed. He did not know the answers, but would ask her what she thought it meant. One interesting discussion led to another, and the Bible provided all the answers. One evening when he came home from work, the sister noticed that he hurriedly washed himself and quickly dressed, obviously going somewhere. When asked where he was going, he replied: “You will soon see.” When the sister got to the Kingdom Hall, she found her husband there! Now he allows the truth to come in through both ears, and he uses his mouth to let it come out, for he is now a dedicated publisher of the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is not always necessary to meet a person at home; Jesus preached to people he met on the road. Likewise, two publishers met a man on the road as he was coming from his fields, and they discussed the sermon “The Bible’s Promise of a Better System of Things.” The man asked so many questions about the Kingdom that the publishers saw, to their amazement, that they had spent two hours explaining the truth to him. He accepted the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet and later said that he had been praying to God to show him the way to go so as to be able to serve Him. Arrangements have been made to point this way out through a home Bible study. Even though this man is in his sixties, he walks three miles in order to attend these studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CAYMAN ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,511</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 608</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">People in this territory are scattered and the brothers do not have automobiles; nevertheless, the good news of God’s kingdom is gradually reaching into all parts. During the past year the inhabitants of the Cayman Islands were introduced to the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.”</span><span class="font9"> The film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” was taken to Grand Cayman by the district servant from Jamaica. The showing was attended by fifty persons, which was considered a fine attendance, since this was at the time that mosquitoes swarm in the area, but the swatting went on unnoticed as the audience gave their attention to the film. The people were impressed by the fact that there are so many worshipers of Jehovah throughout the earth, as evidenced in the film. This gave them an opportunity to see that persons from all nations worship Jehovah God and not just the few they see on their island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">JAPAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 98,274,964</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,336 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 22,665</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Modern Japan rides high on a tide of material prosperity. Has this affected the spirituality of the Japanese Kingdom publishers? Apparently not at all! They have found their delight in the law of Jehovah, and Jehovah has blessed them. (Ps. 1:1-3) Jehovah’s witnesses’ teaching of new ones has met with excellent success, because 581 persons were baptized during the past year, the highest so far in any one year in Japan. Meeting attendance improved remarkably during the year, as more and more of the brothers appreciate that they must not forsake the house of their God. While another excellent witness was given in Japan, there is still a lot more work to be done if we are going to reach all the people of that country with the good news of God’s kingdom. Here are some very interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young lady was making good progress through a home Bible study until an issue arose due to her refusal to worship at the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan</span><span class="font9"> (family Buddhist altar). Her father, fearing that his daughter would not worship him after his death, attempted to stop the study. However, the sister conducting the study told him of a home she knew where the daughter, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, cared lovingly for her Buddhist parents until they died. On the other hand, the son did nothing to help his parents while they were alive but bought them a $300 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan</span><span class="font9"> after they died. The father saw the point, and the daughter continues her Bible studies and is now attending meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister who teaches flower arranging does incidental witnessing among her pupils. At an office where she teaches the female staff she was provided with lunch, and she bowed her head in prayer before taking up her chopsticks. One girl, seeing this, asked if she was a Christian, and this led to a home Bible study. Every week after teaching flower arranging she would study the Bible with her and explain something about God’s organization. She encouraged the girl to attend meetings near her home, and this she did, even though she had to travel over an hour and along a lonely road. She attended an assembly and soon was preaching and was baptized. Now she has completed two years of regular pioneering and has herself brought many others to the truth. Recently she entered the special pioneer service. It all started with a silent prayer at mealtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother who runs a tailoring business hangs the Society’s calendar in his store. This year the calendar was in Japanese for the first time, and it attracted much attention. One young man asked for an explanation of ‘not neglecting the house of our God,’ and as a result literature was placed with him and a study started. He is studying very keenly, and attended the Memorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A newly appointed overseer changed his work so that he could have more time to devote to the congregation. He now sells hairdressing equipment and supplies, while his wife operates a beauty parlor. The business is always closed well ahead of meeting times, and when there is special activity, such as during the circuit servant’s visit, it is closed for half a day or more at a time. A card in the window notifies customers when the parlor will open again. The wife also shuts up shop to have a regular study with her assistant beautician. Whenever the shop opens again, there are always customers waiting. Putting Kingdom interests first has not hurt business at all. The shop was closed for a whole week for this year’s district assembly, and there the assistant beautician was baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a country area a sister lived forty minutes’ walk away from the meeting hall, and she had a three-year-old child, too small to walk that far and too big to carry. She decided the only solution was to learn to ride a bicycle. Her husband laughed at her, but said that if she learned to ride he would buy her a new bicycle. This made her more determined than ever. She got up an hour earlier each morning to practice. At first she got bruised all over her body from bumping into things and falling off the bicycle. However, with help from her husband she finally learned to ride, and now she has her bright new bicycle equipped with a seat for carrying her child. She can get to meetings in only ten minutes, finds preaching and back-calls much easier and does vacation pioneering. Jehovah blessed her determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In covering some territories we frequently meet the same person with the same objection. A young man had refused the magazines, saying he was busy and went to church anyway. The next time over the territory he said the same thing. “Do you know God’s name?” the pioneer sister asked quickly, before the door closed. She was able to explain the name, using the cover of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> and placed two magazines. When she made the back-call, the young man’s initial attitude was the same as on previous calls: “Did you know that God’s kingdom began to rule in 1914?” the sister asked quickly. As a result she was invited in to explain this, and a study was started. Admitting that there were many things that he did not understand, the young man asked for a study every day, but he had to be satisfied with just twice a week. After two weeks the circuit servant visited, and the sister showed the young man how to prepare for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study. He was the first one to arrive at the hall and answered several times during the study. No longer being “too busy” with other things, he now attends Sunday and Tuesday meetings regularly. Tactful, interest-arousing questions brought this fine result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">KENYA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,365,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 294 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 31,854</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The love of the people of Kenya for God and his Word has not diminished in any way during the past service year. As Jehovah’s witnesses talk to people of all tribes and languages, many are embracing the truth and are becoming truly united with their brothers and sisters world wide. A number of strong, new groups of publishers have developed throughout the territory under the Kenya branch. It appears that the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses has become established on a firm foundation in the countries of Kenya, Burundi, Seychelles Islands, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Here are some of the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A keen appreciation for Bible truths is seen in that when honest persons who previously attended religious organizations come to know the truth, they are quick to discard previous false teachings and replace these by true teachings heavily supported by the Scriptures. A typical case is that of an African businessman who began to study, showed good interest, and, as a result, stopped attending his church. The bishop, who had never called on him before, now visited him. Unable to make headway with the man, who refuted him at every turn, he threatened him with hellfire. The bishop was requested not to visit the house again, but did so when the interested person was not at home. He tried to draw the man’s wife back to church, as she had previously been a zealous church worker. The bishop said: “You can do this witnessing work and you don’t have to believe in the Trinity, but just continue coming to church.” The lady, using the Scriptures with real skill, gave several reasons why she could no longer associate with false religion, and the bishop withdrew. Both husband and wife are now regular publishers and were baptized recently at the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly in Nairobi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even though personal freedom may be restricted, if a person has the right heart attitude he can gain spiritual freedom. A young man who began to study with Jehovah’s witnesses was sent to prison on a false accusation. During the several weeks he was in detention awaiting his sentence the sister who had started the study with him visited him in company with other publishers and encouraged him to continue to study the Bible. The young man was so impressed by the kindness shown to him and the concern for his spiritual welfare that he studied very diligently during his eight months’ imprisonment in order to find the reason for such a display of true friendship. When he was released he displayed a ready zeal, witnessing to all his friends. As a result, one of them began to study, and soon both young men were attending the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Both made rapid progress, and after just a few months of study both were baptized at the district assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BURUNDI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,224,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 202,182</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There has been a fine year of theocratic progress in Burundi. A circuit servant from Uganda was able to make two visits during the year. On his first visit in January three new brothers were baptized, to become the first three in Burundi to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah, though a number had done publishing for some time. The circuit servant was able to talk to a group of fourteen persons on the theme “Not Neglecting Jehovah’s House.” On his second visit in July, twenty-eight attended his talk and the number of publishers had increased from six to twelve, in spite of the fact that two brothers left the country. These zealous brothers are averaging thirty-two hours </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> month and, under the guidance of a special pioneer from Tanzania who visits from time to time, they regularly conduct five meetings each week. Truly the brothers in Burundi are ‘not neglecting the house of their God.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SEYCHELLES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46,472</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 7,745</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The small group of brothers in the Seychelles Islands continue to make sure progress. During the year the group, who had previously been scattered among the islands, all moved to the main island. Regular meetings were organized, and interested persons are at last able to associate regularly with the brothers. Two of them are now giving regular talks in the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SUDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,831,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 39 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 329,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The work is progressing slowly in the Sudan. Though there has not been an increase in numbers during the year, the quality of work done has improved considerably. One indication of this is that the distribution of literature and the conducting of Bible studies have both increased 100 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Letter writing is sometimes the only way in which Jehovah’s sheeplike ones are able to receive the truth. The following experience shows the good results that can be obtained by patience in this feature of service: Three years ago on his way to a remote part of the Sudan a man obtained copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> He so enjoyed the contents that he read the magazines many times and then wrote the Society to subscribe for them. The address of this person was sent to the Khartoum Congregation and a study was started by correspondence. For more than two years the study continued in this way in spite of disturbances in the country that caused delay to the mails. The man studied diligently, witnessed to many of his friends and corresponded with his brother in Khartoum, arranging for the congregation to study with him. A few months ago the interested man was transferred to Khartoum and now continues his study with the brother who used to write to him. He has made fine progress in the truth and recently started to preach to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TANZANIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 10,498,400</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 836 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 13,558</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year a number of arrests of brothers were made due to the misrepresentation of the work to the superior authorities of this land by religiously prejudiced persons. However, one important fact stands out and that is that all the charges made were eventually dismissed due to lack of evidence of any unlawful act by Jehovah’s people. In a number of places where brothers had to face charges and were released there is now a marked friendliness on the part of officials who had previously been instructed to detain the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One pioneer who was held in custody for a considerable time early in the year reports that recently one of the officials approached him and asked for a Bible study, confessing that, though he was charged to act against the brothers, in doing so he had made a bad mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In spite of such hindrances the work goes ahead. There are many fair-minded persons in Tanzania who refuse to be influenced by religious pressure to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from peacefully preaching to others. In one village a special pioneer met with twentyseven interested persons. This enraged the local pastor of the Moravian Church, who complained to the Village Executive Officer that the pioneer had no right to preach in his parish. The officer replied: “I give you permission to take out all persons you have created amongst the villagers and leave those created by God to be preached to by others. Let the people themselves seek where the truth is, for everyone has freedom to change to the religion he thinks is the true one.” The pioneer reports that the following morning he started four new studies with the interested people in that village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Five years ago a special pioneer was sent to the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro to help an isolated group of five publishers. The truth took root to the extent that there are now 111 brothers in two congregations and one isolated group. Respect for God’s Word has been manifest in that, though this area abounds with the practices of drinking blood and consensual relationships between men and women, Jehovah’s witnesses have become renowned in the area for their abstinence from blood and their respect for the divine marriage requirements. Though it is the custom for a woman to be given a blood gravy to impart stamina to the newborn child, the children of Jehovah’s witnesses are not found to be lacking stamina in any way though they shun this God-dishonouring custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">UGANDA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,551,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 188,775</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Twelve years ago a surgeon began work in a Catholic mission in Sierra Leone, West Africa. Having a deep appreciation for Bible truth, he started a Bible discussion group. This was discouraged by the mission priest. Again in Ghana he started a similar discussion group, but again this was discontinued as the priest indicated that the bishop felt such Bible study was unnecessary. Four years ago this God-fearing doctor moved to Uganda to carry on his mission work. Twice he endeavoured to gain the support of the priest there to organize a Bible study group. Each time, due to the reluctance and apathy of the priest, the study fell through. Finally, the doctor succeeded in his purpose by organizing the study group as a private arrangement without priestly interference. He reports: “We were looking for spiritual food through the Bible and could not get it.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was at this point that he was contacted by a brother who visited the mission hospital as a drug salesman. The brother was able to give a good witness to the doctor and upon his arrival home he found a letter awaiting him requesting that he be sent books explaining the Bible so he could be prepared to discuss the points when the brother made his next trip. Besides sending the books, the brother made arrangements for another brother from a nearby town to study with the doctor. Rapid progress was made, and the doctor, in turn, started a Bible study with his wife and two nurses in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet. Soon thereafter the circuit servant visited the nearby congregation and was delighted when the doctor turned up at the talk with his wife, the two nurses and four other interested persons. Before coming to the Nairobi assembly, which both he and his wife attended, the doctor wrote to the brother telling him he had resigned from the Catholic Mission because he believes that Jehovah says it is time now to get out of “Babylon.” He quoted Proverbs 3:5, 6. He is now making plans to move to a congregation so he can make better progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">KOREA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 28,647,176</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 6,005 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,771</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea enjoyed to the full the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly in Seoul. All of them realize that the freedom God has given to his people is a most priceless possession, and something that cannot be taken away from any who remain alert and faithful. The program in Korea was the same as in all other parts of the world. It was stimulating and left all the brothers with the feeling of urgency to make good use of the remaining time. It has helped many to understand that they must widen the gap between themselves in Jehovah’s organization, and the old system of things, including Babylon the Great. Since the work was reorganized in 1951 after the Korean War, there has never been a shortage of interested persons wanting to be taught the Kingdom message. The problem has been to hold on to all of those who have heard the truth and dedicated their lives to God. Here are some interesting items the branch servant has sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Korea is an emerging nation, making its first important strides forward in developing its economy; and it has been noticed that materialism has become a temptation to a degree heretofore unknown. It has also been noticed that higher education of the young people has been given an importance even above the Kingdom interests by many youths and parents alike. Opposition from pagan family members is still a big factor. Some stumble over the matter of Christian neutrality. With others it is simply lack of endurance in doing good works. Whatever the individual factor, it still remains that, during the 1966 service year, for every six persons coming into the organization five dedicated persons have become inactive. A still greater effort on the part of overseers and their assistants is needed to offer the personal help and assistance needed for the weaker ones to endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Korea needs more pioneers. Parents’ encouraging their children and inculcating the pioneer spirit means so much. In Pohang a sister went immediately into the pioneer work after graduation from high school. At a recent assembly she told why. She was raised by parents who had the pioneer spirit themselves. Her father, although an overseer and a full-time high-school teacher, has been a regular pioneer for a number of years. She says that in her family the children would have no other thought than to become pioneers. This sister was offered a chance to go abroad for study, something highly sought after by Korean students, but she refused in favor of a career as a pioneer. In another case a young sister wanted to pioneer very much but her parents opposed her, saying they needed her support to make ends meet for the other children. For the next five years she vacation pioneered at intervals, for the purpose of showing her family she could do both full-time service and assist her family. She was finally able to overcome the opposition and is now happily engaged in the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The majority of the people of Korea live in small villages in areas that are too remote and too small to be considered as special pioneer territories. The principal way new groups and eventually congregations are developed is by publishers from the larger areas either moving back to their home village or by visiting temporarily, introducing the Kingdom message to the local villagers. A brother went back to his native village of eighty families and witnessed to all of them. As always, an issue immediately arose among the interested ones over ancestor worship, the village elders violently opposing. Among the interested ones was this publisher’s younger brother. Both parents disapproved, and the mother, a devout Buddhist, took it upon herself to visit all the people to whom her dedicated son preached in order to undo his work. In time the circuit servant visited the interested people. A public talk was arranged. At the end, one of the elders who attended got up and said: “We should walk the way of life rather than the way of the dead.” This comment by this respected eighty-one-year-old elder encouraged the interested ones who thought all the elders were unalterably opposed. As the meeting closed and the publisher’s father came in to beat him, this old man persuaded the father to return home and told the young brother not to blame his father but to endure as Jesus had done. And so, even this older generation can be moved by hearing God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the remaining time grows shorter, it is more important than ever that a proper balance be kept between our secular work and Jehovah’s work. In this country few people have 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. jobs. For most it means working twelve to sixteen hours, seven days a week, for subsistence pay. In Wonju the overseer is a carpenter, whose business traditionally depends on his being on call at all times. He found that more and more he was being called out at times that interfered with his theocratic schedule of field service and attendance at the meetings. He realized he could not continue this way and be putting the interests of the Kingdom first. He determined that, no matter how much business it cost him, he was going to keep his theocratic schedule. After his customers got used to his firmness, he found that the customers he thought he would lose came back later at a convenient time and that he did not really lose any of his livelihood after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the close of the service year the first class of the new two-week Kingdom Ministry School was in progress. This first group of circuit and district servants were very pleased with the arrangement and all commented on how convenient it was to have the course in the Bethel home and have use of the new Kingdom Hall and the facilities of the enlarged home. We will be having one course a month through the new service year, and the Bethel family enjoys having the fellowship of the brothers from all parts of Korea’s field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LEBANON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;1,822,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 918 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,985</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The branch office at Beirut looks after a vast territory where the Arabic language is spoken. In all the countries under its jurisdiction Jehovah’s witnesses have found it very difficult to continue the preaching of the good news. During the past service year opposition has been quite severe in a number of places and, as the Scriptures point out, many hear with annoyance. While others happily embrace the message of the truth, they are not very many in these Arabic-speaking countries. Jehovah’s witnesses are grateful for the privilege of continuing to hold forth the Word of life in these lands. The report that follows covers the countries of Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Don’t bother preaching in our village, Mister. You were not able to convince more than one person here in the last twenty-five years.” So objected one of the women of a small village noted for its scenery and fine fruits. But the brother continued his service in the territory, and in a short time one of the villagers showed some appreciation for the truth and consented to have a Bible study in his home. This aroused the ire of the local priest, who then stirred up some of his followers to persecute the newly interested person, even to the point of beating him up. They punctured the tires of the car of the brother who was conducting the study and threatened to set the car on fire if he kept coming. So it was arranged for a brother from a nearby town who was not known in the village to take the study, and he used public transportation to get there so as not to attract attention. This meant there was no way for him to get back home after the study, which had to be held in the evening, so the householder arranged for the brother to spend the night at his house each week when he conducted the study. Jehovah blessed this arrangement, and in a short time the interested person declared his dedication to Jehovah, and was baptized. It is now about one year since the woman told the brother not to bother preaching in that village, and the study that was at first attended by four or five persons now has an attendance of twenty to thirty each week. Fourteen of these have started preaching the good news from house to house. When the circuit servant visited them recently, it was arranged for them to have a service center and to conduct the service meeting and Theocratic Ministry School. So this little fruit-growing village is now producing fruits of a spiritual kind, and the group there is well on its way to becoming a new congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The importance of following up interest the best we can under existing circumstances is illustrated by this experience sent in by a brother in a small town: “As my wife and I were working from house to house one day we were invited in by a lady who wanted to listen to the sermon. At first her twenty-four-year-old son did not pay any attention to the conversation, but about halfway through the sermon he began to take part in the conversation. He began to help us convince his mother of what we were saying, as she had now became skeptical. The young man’s interest was definitely aroused on that first call, whereas his mother finally showed no interest and even refused to receive us when we went back. After that I started to watch for the young man on the streets of our small town, and each time I had a chance I would encourage him to keep on reading the literature and studying the Bible. He attended some meetings at our local Kingdom Hall, even though by now his mother was opposing the truth. Later, he moved to a large town and began to attend meetings with one of the congregations there. After a time he returned to our town, and I met him on the street one day. He told me what he had been doing and asked if he could go out in the service with me on Sunday. Of course, I welcomed him to come along. On Sunday, after working a few doors, we were arrested by the gendarmes because they thought we were inviting people to attend an assembly that we had been forbidden to hold. I was very much concerned over the effect this might have on the young man with me who was out in the service for the first time. So, since he was not carrying a bag, I attempted to bid him good-bye and go with the gendarmes alone to the station. But he refused to leave and said to me: ‘Whatever happens to you is going to happen to me too.’ Observing this, the gendarmes said: ‘Why are you telling him good-bye? We are going to take him too.’ So I pointed out to them that I was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and had the bag of literature and the Bible but that my friend had nothing with him. But they said they must take him too. My young friend then spoke up and said: ‘Well, who said I wasn’t going anyhow? Here, I’ll lead the way.’ At the station they asked us many questions but could find nothing wrong with what we were doing. They asked my friend why he had started associating with Jehovah’s witnesses, and he informed them that he had observed they were the only people following God’s law and the law of the land conscientiously and that kept God’s command to love their neighbor, and since he considered these things to be good for everyone in the country he had started associating with and studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. Then they told us that, if we would promise not to go around preaching anymore, they would let us go. So I asked them what was wrong about preaching the Bible, as that is what the people really need. I mentioned that it would be good for them, too, to read and study the Bible, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I presented some of the literature. At that one of them said to the other: ‘I think we had better let them go and not ask them any more questions or they will be changing our minds and way of thinking.’ His friend agreed, and we left after placing four booklets with them. Rather than frightening my new service companion, this experience even encouraged him, and he continues to make good progress.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The small congregation in Iran has had Jehovah’s blessing this past service year as they kept pressing ahead with Kingdom interests. A regular pioneer moved there from the United States to continue his pioneer work, and he has been a real blessing to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some years ago a German lady came to Iran to work for a company there. She had heard quite </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> bit about the truth; so when she arrived in the capital of Iran she immediately looked up the Witnesses. She made rapid progress in her study of the truth and soon started in the service and dedicated her life to Jehovah. During the years since then she has remained in Iran, renewing her contract for work each year so as to serve there where the need is so great. For a long time it has been her heartfelt desire to be a regular pioneer, but she was not able to do so due to her necessary secular work, although she was a vacation pioneer a number of times. But during this past service year she was finally able to arrange matters to enter the regular pioneer service. Though this has meant extra work and planning to get everything done, she is happier than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAQ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,263,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The brother in Iraq has been busy spreading seeds of truth during the year. Due to the fact that his mail was being censored he was called to the police station and questioned. They had read in one of his letters that he was an “ambassador” and they wanted to know what kind of ambassador he was. He explained the matter Scripturally, but they began to watch him, and he had to be very careful in his service after that. Nevertheless, many heard the message of truth in Iraq this year, and it is hoped some of the seed sown will take root in the hearts of interested people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">JORDAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,860,493</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">At the beginning of the 1966 service year a branch office was operating in Jordan. But because of pressures from Babylon the Great, the government refused to renew the visas of the branch servant and his wife so they were forced to leave the country by December 10, 1965. So now the work of the brothers in Jordan comes under the direction of the Lebanese office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was the privilege of the brothers to have the visit of the zone servant during the latter part of November and the first part of December, and in conjunction with his visit a one-day “Word of Truth” assembly. Fifty-eight brothers from all parts of Jordan came to this assembly, thus not neglecting the house of God in the face of difficulties. They were rewarded by a rich spiritual feast. The assembly was held without incident, and all were greatly encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother doing secular work wrote: “On January 20 I had to go with some men to visit the various ‘holy places’ in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Hebron, as I was to serve as their guide. The three-day tour turned out to be a wonderful opportunity to witness. One of these men was on his way to London but decided to stay all three days so as to see old Jerusalem. He showed no interest in the Bible, but after he saw all the places of Biblical interest in Jerusalem and heard my explanation of the differences between the teachings of the Bible and Christendom’s religions, he was moved to ask many questions. On passing a bookshop he saw a book about the Bible, which he was then interested in reading. This made me introduce the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,’</span><span class="font9"> and I was successful in placing it with him.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The brothers in Kuwait are thankful to Jehovah that they have been able to receive spiritual food all during the past service year in spite of the fact that much of what is sent to them is confiscated by the post office. Some of the sisters have had strong persecution from family members, and this has hindered both service and meeting arrangements. The brothers are not able to meet in the same place regularly or at the same time each week, but meetings are held and the benefits from them enjoyed. Those in the small group are of three different languages, French, Arabic and Greek. But a system has been devised for using all three languages at their small meeting. We pray that Jehovah may continue to bless these few brothers in Kuwait as they keep true worship alive there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SAUDI ARABIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 8,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Saudi Arabia continues to be a land with few Witnesses but with many people who need to hear the truth. During the year several publishers were able to do some witnessing there. One brother who worked for an oil company in Saudi Arabia witnessed to his fellow workers as often as possible. Many showed interest, but in that land, too, Satan is sowing the seeds of disbelief. The brother writes: “There are many persons here who are atheists. At the same time there are many ‘Christians’ who claim to believe in God, Christ and the Bible, but when I try to discuss some of the vital doctrines that a true Christian should know, they quickly abandon their ‘belief’ and belittle the Bible and all that it teaches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister was called to the police station for questioning as a result of her mail’s being censored. When she was sent for at her place of employment, the manager was quite amazed. He went along with her to the police station to help her. He told the police that if they had sent for any of the other girls that work for him he would not have been surprised, but that this girl is a model of good conduct and he could not imagine what they wanted with her. They began to question the sister, and by Jehovah’s help she was able to give them an appropriate witness and answer all their questions satisfactorily. Since then she has continued to receive the literature and correspondence sent to her with no difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SYRIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,067,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Syria has seen another year of unrest with one coup d’etat and several attempted ones. The brothers have had legal difficulties too and have had opposition from the clergy and other sources. In one village the homes of the brothers were raided and their literature was confiscated. They were taken to police headquarters but were later acquitted and some of the literature was returned to them. A local writer published a book against Jehovah’s witnesses, making the usual false charge of Zionism among other things. This writer was called on by a group of brothers who gave him correct information about Jehovah’s witnesses and cleared up his viewpoint quite a bit. He confided</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">in the brothers that the clergy had induced him to write the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Even though conditions are unsettled in Syria, many are finding it the right time to start serving Jehovah. Two high-school girls, very much interested in learning new things, began studying the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot; </span><span class="font9">book with a Witness, but stopped halfway through because of opposition by one of their teachers. Two years went by until one of the girls again came in contact with the truth while visiting her aunt, who was studying with the Witnesses. She started studying again, but secretly so that nothing would interfere with the study. The study was held twice a week to make up for lost time. Rapid progress was made and she began attending meetings and publishing the good news. She interested her sister, who also began to publish. Then they interested their two brothers, and they became publishers. Now the first girl is baptized. Her sister plans to be at the next circuit assembly. Their brothers continue to make good progress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In the city of St. Johns in Antigua of the Leeward Islands the Society has a branch office. From there the work on nine islands receives direction, including Antigua, Anguilla, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Kitts and St. Martin. On some of these islands we have a goodly number of Jehovah’s witnesses who are able to visit all the people living on the island, but on some of the others we really need more preachers. We know that faith comes from hearing, and if anyone is going to hear there need to be preachers. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Leeward Islands have made it their custom to be regular and patient in calling on the people of the islands, and they have done very well in helping them to learn the Word of God. Some of these people live in homes that are hidden away in the mountains or at the end of the road, but Jehovah’s witnesses in the Leeward Islands feel it their individual Christian responsibility to let their light shine in these isolated places, and they <a name="bookmark165"></a><a name="bookmark166"></a>have done this with good success. Here are some experiences from each of the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister who had to go and see a doctor remembered that often much time has to be spent waiting, so she took along some literature. It happened that because of an emergency the doctor was later than usual. The result was three hours in the service, nineteen magazines, one book and a booklet placed. The sister commented: “It was a joy to speak to sick people of God’s promise for a better system of things. I am so glad I used the opportunity to give a witness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One publisher was not able to support the congregation’s Magazine Day, as she had to see a friend off at the airport. However, being conscious of placing magazines, she took her supply with her. As passengers are required to check in one hour before flight time, the sister decided it was a good opportunity and a fine place to offer the magazines to the many busy people who do not normally hear. During the interval she placed sixteen magazines. How many times this fine opportunity may be overlooked!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first new Kingdom Hall built by the brothers in Antigua was dedicated recently. A neighbor who came in to look at the hall when the brothers were working on it said: “You people put us to shame the way you get busy and build your own meeting place.” The brothers are more than pleased with the results of the hard work put into this fine building, to which they are happy to invite newly interested persons. The government recently built a new road in front of the Kingdom Hall and, since the district representative was acquainted with our work, fittingly named it “Paradise Street.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The building of their new Kingdom Hall has had a good effect on the congregation’s activities, with meeting attendances improving considerably. “It is indeed a joy,” said the overseer, “to see interested ones sitting on the steps of the Kingdom Hall awaiting the brothers to open the hall for the congregation meetings. During the week of the next circuit assembly the brothers look forward to dedicating this fine new building and to having all the assembly sessions held there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Much work was accomplished during April, when four publishers shared in the vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">DOMINICA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63,609</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The statement ‘the day of a man’s death is better than the day of his birth’ may be true in the following experience. A study was started with a man located in an infirmary. Over a period of time he learned the truth, as the Witness called back regularly. One day he stated to the Witness: “Just think, I spent all those years in the Catholic church and I had to come to a place like this to learn the truth.” In this home live mainly poor people. This man, who was now penniless, had been a newspaperman most of his life. When he became sick and it was evident he was going to die, others in the home began to say to him: “Well, now what is going to happen to you? You have left the Church and now who is going to look after you when you die?” He remained undisturbed by these remarks. After his death the brothers arranged for the funeral service, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> short talk was delivered at the infirmary. The aged people in the home were able to listen and observe. The attention this man was given was far more than they would receive when they died. They saw he had gained real friends as a result of accepting the truth. How much better it is to die in God’s memory, having made a record of merit with Jehovah, than to cater to the wishes of men! The attitude of those in the infirmary has changed considerably toward the Witness who visits there, and many are realizing that one should not cling to a false way of worship just because of fear of how he will be buried.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A Bible study was conducted with a person intermittently over a period of ten years without much sign of progress. When a new special pioneer came to the territory, this study was turned over to him, with the comment: “Try this study for a month and see what happens.” On the first call the person said: “I wonder how we are going to get along?” The pioneer assured her that they would get along well in their study of the Bible. The pioneer made sure that it was a progressive study, each call explaining some point of truth and building up the woman’s appreciation for the truth and Jehovah’s organization. As a result, she started attending the meetings. After this the special pioneer prepared her gradually for service when the circuit servant would visit the next time. In between visits they discussed dedication in preparation for baptism, so that on the next visit of the circuit servant this person was ready for baptism after ten years. When asked what helped her to get started after so long, she answered: “When I observed the patience and humility of the brothers and I got to understand the truths taught and could see these things for myself in the Bible, then I knew this was Jehovah’s organization and so I had to do something. I could not go back and sit at the feet of the clergy any more.” Now her aim is to press on to maturity so she can bear 'thorough witness.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NEVIS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12,770</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A Bible study had been discontinued with a family with many children, as the mother could not seem to arrange time for the study. It was decided to try to renew the study with just the children. This was agreed upon. The mother’s niece lived with the family, but at first she would not sit in on the study. After some persuasion, however, she did sit in and soon became quite interested and became a regular participant in the study each week. The publisher invited this niece and the children to the congregation book study, which was nearby. They attended and at this meeting they heard the announcements of the other meetings for field service at the Kingdom Hall. What a surprise to the publisher studying with them when one Sunday morning the niece and three children were at the Kingdom Hall ready for field service! Since then they have attended all congregation meetings and are making very good progress in the truth. The publisher is more convinced than ever of the importance of encouraging all members of the household to sit in on home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SABA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,007</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The circuit servant and his wife made three visits to this island during the year. Fine hospitality is shown by the people here and over 200 pieces of literature, including 20 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> were placed. These visits have been very encouraging to the isolated publisher, who has been doing his best to talk to people about the Kingdom truths. Showing appreciation for the work of the Society, one man said: “It is a pity there are not more of your kind of ministers around these days to help people understand the Bible.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The Macedonian call is being sounded from here because the one publisher finds it impossible to cope with all the interest that has been found during the past year. The sister has done her best trying to care for them and she makes the most of the circuit servant’s visits and looks forward to the time when more help will be forthcoming. In the meantime she conducts two home Bible studies regularly, aside from her own family studies. At a circuit assembly in St. Kitts everyone was very happy to have the sister from St. Eustatius in attendance. She very much appreciates the encouraging letters she has received from thoughtful sisters in other places.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The attitude of parents toward their service to Jehovah God has a direct bearing on the outlook their children have for the pioneer service. A sister with five children to care for has averaged twenty-four hours a month in the ministry and vacation pioneers once each year. When her oldest son finished school he took up the regular pioneer service at sixteen years of age. He is now nineteen and is serving as a special pioneer on the island of Dominica. Parents can do much to cultivate the desire in their sons and daughters to pioneer after finishing school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One new congregation was organized in St. Kitts during the year, and the foundation has been laid for a new Kingdom Hall by the Sandy Point Congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">One Magazine Day a group of pioneers and publishers went into a territory. They divided into two groups and set a goal of fifty magazines for each group for that morning. When they met at noontime one group had placed their goal, but the other had not. They all decided to work another half hour. When they met again and checked the results, 130 magazines had been placed. Do you set a goal for your own Magazine Day?</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark168"></a>For two years, during 1963 and 1964, when heavy persecution was on the brothers in Liberia there was a very great falling away. But in the past two years there has been a steady increase and now there is an average of 365 publishers in Liberia, and these have given a very fine witness throughout the land. The brothers have taken a very determined stand and Jehovah’s rich blessing has been upon them. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">Favorable publicity was indeed welcome this year. Many Liberians saw the zone servant and a local overseer interviewed to the first time over TV. This must have impressed some people, for the next day a motorist braked to a halt in the middle of a street to thank the zone servant for the way he presented our views on the flag issue. Our district assembly was also well publicized, Monrovia’s major daily running front-page articles for three days, twice with pictures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The flag issue is not dead by any means. The refusal of authorities to allow young publishers simply to stand respectfully at flag ceremonies has resulted in expulsions from schools for not saluting. Recently four students each endured twenty-five strokes with a strong rattan stick for not participating in Flag Day exercises. Another was expelled for not repeating the pledge. Some of the students were later allowed to return to school, but as the year ended a security officer studying the truth was arrested for not saluting. Freedom of worship triumphed, however, when the case was dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Assemblies have a great impact on the newly interested. A pioneer sister making a back-call on an elderly woman was thrilled to hear her say: “I believe the Lord answered my prayer to show me the right people, those who are serving him, by directing you to call at my home. Your sermon greatly impressed me and I have thought about it all week.” A study was quickly started with this woman who was looking for ‘the right people’ serving God. And where could she better see these people in action than at the circuit assembly? So after just a couple of studies the woman was brought to the assembly. She saw the latest film. On the second day the sister planned to go in the service without the lady. “No,” protested the latter, “I’m coming along with you. I think I have found the people doing God’s will and I don’t want to be left behind.” She continues making good progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Their law is strong!” So people describe the right religion’s firm devotion to principle. In a jungle town a special pioneer studied with a blind woman who gained a deep respect for Jehovah’s laws. When the brother was transferred, the completely pagan villagers tried to win the woman back to their ways by cooking unbled meat for her. Tipped off to this by her young daughter, the woman refused food for three days, saying she preferred death to eating blood. Her fearless example caused these pagans to relent, and when the special pioneer returned for a visit he now found many of them interested in learning the “strong law” of Jehovah God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in this small country of Luxembourg enjoyed their year of preaching the good news of the Kingdom to the people of the land. They showed this by devoting more hours in field service activity than any year previously. And it bore good results, because they averaged 321 Bible studies conducted in the homes of the people every week. The people of Luxembourg are showing more interest year by year; they are taking more bound books and more of the magazines than before, and for this we are glad. The branch servant sends us a few experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the age of eight one young lad heard about the truth for the first time. However, he understood only one thing, that God’s name is Jehovah. So when in trouble he would always pray to Jehovah. Other than that he showed no concern for him at all. There was also no change in this situation when he became a grown-up. In the meantime he became so engrossed in sports that he had time for nothing else. As it happened, because of sports, he met many people, but he also met with many disappointments. For this reason he began to wonder about the purpose of living, but he found no answer to all his questions. Then he remembered the God whose name is Jehovah. He turned to him in prayer, and the next day one of Jehovah’s witnesses called at his door! He received an answer to all his questions as together they studied the Bible. At the age of thirty-four this man was baptized at the latest circuit assembly. This shows us once again that Jehovah is long-suffering, and also that in his due time he hears prayers directed to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Often one becomes discouraged when preaching to his own relatives when they refuse to react to the Kingdom message immediately. The following experience had in Luxembourg shows us once more that we should not give up trying to explain the Bible’s message to our relatives, since we shall reap in the end if we do not grow weary. A man heard of the truth for the first time through his cousin. Since he considered the matter serious, he went to his priest and asked for a Bible. The priest did not want to give him one, and said it would be better for uneducated persons not to read the Bible. Still he mentioned a bookstore where this interested person could purchase a Bible for 30 DM (U.S., $7.50), and that he did. His cousin in Germany sent him the magazines regularly, but this man’s wife subscribed for one of the magazines without his knowledge when a brother called at their door. She wanted to come in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses in order to show they were false prophets and should become Catholics again. Her husband supported her in this, since they were both strict Catholics. Their undertaking was not crowned with success, however, for soon they liked the Kingdom message so much that they began attending meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses instead of the Catholic church. Soon the lady was baptized, and the man symbolized his dedication at the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly. All this came about because a cousin did not give up telling her cousin about the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MALAGASY REPUBLIC Population: 6,335,810 Peak Publishers: 214 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 29,607</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The organization in Malagasy has grown from seven publishers in 1956 to 194 in 1966. Excellent progress is being made in all fields of service. New peaks were reached in the distribution of bound books, new subscriptions, individual magazines placed and Bible studies conducted; so the publishers in Malagasy Republic have kept themselves very busy. Jehovah’s witnesses have four congregations established there now, and with more special pioneers in the field they will be moving out into new territories. The work is getting a good start. Here are some of their experiences as reported by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is very important to try to have the whole family attend the Bible study. One missionary, having placed the current offer with a lady at the door, expressed his desire to speak also with her husband and asked if he might return at a time when he would be there. On calling back the following week the missionary found both the lady and the gentleman awaiting his visit, although he had to delay his usual time of departure for work. After a brief discussion a study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News”</span><span class="font9"> booklet was proposed. Although they readily accepted this proposition, the gentleman said that he could not guarantee being present the following week or at any other time, as he often had to leave early for his work and sometimes returned very late. However, he agreed that the other members of the family could study. The sample study was conducted and arrangements were made for the next study. Every week since then the whole family has been present for each study and all participate very well. The gentleman has started attending the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study at the Kingdom Hall and, although it is only three months since his first study, he recently said that he must admit that all that he has learned so far is the truth and that it is obvious that once one has started studying with Jehovah’s witnesses one cannot continue to attend church, because the teachings are so different. When it was explained to him that those who study with Jehovah’s witnesses can have the prospect of serving in the preaching work also, he was very pleased and expressed his willingness to share in the ministry. At this point he explained that he was not yet free to preach with Jehovah’s witnesses, as he and the lady with whom he lives were not married. He then quoted Matthew 5:14 and remarked that his present condition was known by all in his community. Now, spurred by his desire to serve Jehovah, he has already taken steps to bring his life into harmony with the righteous Christian requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We have to talk to all kinds of people in our territory, as this experience sent in by a circuit servant shows: “I gave a sermon to an Indian lady and she took the offer. I also gave her booklets in the Gujarati language. Later, when I worked in another part of town, I saw her son. The boy said that his mother wanted to see me. I thought that she was going to give the books back, because it is rare for the Moslems or Hindus to read books about Christianity. But when I called on the lady, to my surprise she asked for one more book for her son. The young Indian boy came to the Kingdom Hall and I had a fine discussion with him. For example, I asked if he knew the name of God. He answered: ‘Jehovah.’ I asked how he knew that, and the boy said that he had already read almost two chapters of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font9"> book, which I left with his mother. A study was started.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">For many reasons Jehovah’s witnesses in Malawi have had a most fruitful and blessed year of activity. Back in 1959 there was a growing spirit of nationalism followed by much persecution and opposition to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. All this contributed to causing the work to stand still, and there was no increase of new associates with the organization. The preaching work did not stop by any means, and the brothers in the truth were just as active as before, but there was no increase so far as total number of publishers was concerned. But a rich blessing has been theirs during the past year. With things more peaceful in the country many people are now listening to what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say. They know what they went through in the way of persecution and how they took their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant looking after the work in Malawi and Mozambique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To what extent would we go to attend an assembly? Often there are problems to overcome. Do we give up easily? One elderly man who was studying said that he wanted to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He was shown that the steps of dedication and baptism would need to be taken. As soon as he heard of the district assemblies for this year and that there would be a baptism at these assemblies, he was determined to attend. Allowing himself sufficient time, he walked the eighty-four miles to the assembly even though he is eighty-three years old. How happy he was to be among those baptized in the waters of Lake Malawi! Having no money for the bus fare had not prevented him from being there. Many brothers and sisters had to travel long distances in order to attend the assemblies. Many walked and others traveled by cycle or bus or other forms of transport. Among those baptized at one of the district assemblies was a man and a twelve-year-old girl who had both walked about 120 miles to reach the assembly. After the assembly was over, they returned on foot to their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Often marriage mates said to be opposed to the truth turn out to be very interested when tact is used. A circuit servant was visiting five new brothers living in isolated territory. They said that their wives were very opposed to the truth, even though they had tried to tell them that this is the truth. The circuit servant visited each of these brothers in turn and started a Bible study in the home with the husband. Then tactfully the wife was invited to sit in. At each home the wife responded favorably and sat in on the study. The next week as the circuit servant was passing through the area he met with these five brothers and their wives. The wives said that they really appreciated the study that was started in their homes and that, even though only one week had passed, it was sufficient for them to see that this was the truth. They even expressed their desire to share in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All types of people accept the truth, and often it is those whom we least expect to listen who do. A special pioneer experienced this in his territory. When he visited an interested person for the weekly Bible study he found the local pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church present. Immediately the pastor asked: “Why don’t you Jehovah’s witnesses keep the sabbath?” The brother answered by showing what the Bible taught. When the pastor found that he had no answer from the Bible, he became very angry, even to the point of being about to assault the brother. But after he left and returned to his home, he began to think. That same night he took the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,” </span><span class="font9">which he had on his bookshelf, and began to read In it concerning the sabbath. He saw that what was written was no different from what the special pioneer had told him and shown him from the Bible. After praying, he asked his wife: “Which is the true congregation about which Jesus said that they would be killed and beaten on account of his name?” His wife said: “You know the answer to that.” The pastor replied: “Yes, it’s Jehovah’s witnesses.” He also said that from that day on he was going to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. In the morning he went to the church to straighten up the records. He then stood up before his congregation and told them he was now becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Next, he went to find the special pioneer. At first the brother thought the man was joking, but, when he realized that he was sincerely seeking the truth, a study was started. He has made rapid progress to maturity and says that, even though he had passed many examinations in the church, he knew in his heart there was a famine that he was unable to satisfy with the teachings and studies of false religion. How happy he is that he has now found the truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do people really mean it when they raise the objection that they are not interested? Many times they do not. One householder told a sister that she was not interested. Then in the next breath she said: “But do come in and have a cup of tea.” The publisher thought that there still might be an opportunity to give a witness. The publisher was relaxed and friendly, and not many minutes had gone by when the publisher found an opportunity to say that she was only spending a few minutes with people showing them the wonderful hope that the Bible offers concerning conditions for this earth. “You mean that you haven’t come just to sell me magazines? I didn’t know that you talked with people about the Bible.” A Bible discussion followed and arrangements were made to start a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Taking every opportunity that presents itself to preach the good news is one way of expanding one’s ministry. One brother was entering the local market when he heard someone whistling one of the Kingdom songs. He approached the man and, thinking he must be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the brother introduced himself. However, this man was not a brother and was just whistling the Kingdom song because he liked the tune. Taking this opportunity to give a witness, he asked the man whether he knew the difference between this song and others of the world. A Bible discussion ensued, resulting in placement of a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MOZAMBIQUE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 6,650,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 1,369 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,858</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Besides having patience and perseverance one often has to use different methods in presenting the truth to a person before he accepts it. One brother found the indirect way of presenting the truth to be very fruitful. He had witnessed over a number of years to a couple who were his acquaintances before the husband accepted the truth. At first the couple, who were Catholics, refused to discuss the Bible. For eighteen months the brother witnessed to them without any apparent result. Then he started showing the man articles in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazine on Jehovah’s creation, but without attempting to give a witness. The man started to read all the articles in the magazine offered to him and soon requested that the brother bring every issue. Then he began to ask Bible questions and started to read </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> also. Still the brother was not able to start a Bible study with the man, but the man had a ten-year-old son and the brother asked if he could study with this boy, using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book. Each week the man would drive the seven miles into town to bring his son to the brother’s house. The boy and his mother joined in the study, but the man sat apart. However, when the boy did not answer to the point, his father would tell him the correct answer. Gradually this resulted in the father’s also being drawn into the study. Then he saw the importance of the truth, dedicated himself and was baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Word of Jehovah is very powerful and is able to aid persons to overcome the snare of pagan traditions. The child of an African couple died, and, according to local tradition, the parents were to shave their heads or else they would not be able to have any other children. A lot of pressure was brought on them by others in the village. The husband decided that they would not shave their heads until first he had discussed the matter with the special pioneer, who was studying the Bible with them. The brother showed what the Bible says concerning pagan traditions and told the man that it was now up to him to make the decision. The man put faith in what the Bible teaches and the couple did not shave their heads. The man progressed rapidly and was baptized shortly thereafter. The wife held back a little, but, when she found that she was expecting another child, she told the special pioneer that now she too wanted to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, for she had seen herself the power of God’s Word and that pagan superstitions are not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MAURITIUS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;745,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 142 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 5,240</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Watch Tower Society has a branch office in the small island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean and from this place we direct the work in La Reunion and Rodrigues also. Jehovah’s witnesses on these three islands have had a most joyful time during the year. The people living in these faraway isolated places are giving an ear to the truth. Today on the three islands there are 418 ministers as a result of a 25-percent increase for the Branch. Pioneers and circuit servants in this area are kept very busy arranging for studies with people who want to know what the Bible teaches. Here are reports from the three islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A pioneer relates: “Without knowing the purpose of my visit, a lady invited me in. By the images and the pictures of ‘saints’ and the ‘virgin’ around the room I knew that she was very devout. She said she went to church every morning at 6 a.m. and prayed to the ‘virgin’ for better health. Using </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines, </span><span class="font9">I discussed with her the subject of prayer, showing that prayers should be addressed to Jehovah through the name of Jesus. Although she could not read, she accepted some literature so that the family could read to her. The following week I visited her again, and during our conversation the church bell rang at midday. The lady made the sign of the cross, bowed her head in prayer, saying to me as though I had forgotten something: ‘That was the Angelus, Madame P---, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Angelus.’ I took the occasion to explain to her a little more about what the Bible says about prayer. I was able to start a study with the whole family the following week, and during the study the church bell rang 6 p.m. Their little boy started to make his sign of the cross and pray, when his mother caught his arm, saying: ‘It’s not necessary, son, to do that; from now on we only pray to Jehovah the true God.’ After three months’ study they told me that they had been able to save much money as, since my second visit, they had refused to pay the witch doctor for sacrifices for the wife’s health. He cursed them by scattering cinders in their garden, but even after only two visits the truth had made them free, and they just laughed. With the money they made a contribution for chairs for our new Kingdom Hall. They now attend all meetings, walking two miles each way, and have just started out in service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah allows his servants to be tested in many ways and one of the most difficult is by means of false brothers, those who try to turn others to look to them rather than to Jehovah’s organisation as represented by his appointed servants. In two congregations during the year this trouble arose. Well-respected individuals quietly sowing dissension and distrust were sapping the zeal and enthusiasm of the brothers. The first four months of the service year saw only decrease, then disfellowshipping action was taken against the rebellious ones, and from January to August we were blessed with an increase from 109 to 142 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year we also had a new peak in Bible studies mainly due to the appreciation of many for the vacation pioneer service, during which they started studies and then continued them when they returned to the congregation publisher ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LA REUNION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;415,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 274 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,515</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The expansion of the work continues in La Reunion, with a 33-percent increase. Brothers are now living in eight towns, but due to the lack of mature servants we have only four established congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother writes: “My parents did not approve of our new religion, and they did not hide their disapproval. My mother offered hundreds of prayers to try to make us return, as she sincerely believed that we had strayed into error. Every time she visited us we would talk among ourselves of the truths we had learned, about the name of God, how to pray to him, the condition of the dead, and so forth. As she never expressed an opinion or asked a question, we began to think that it was hopeless. The truth, however, was making inroads. By our constantly talking of the good things that we had learned, she began to think and to compare. This was progress, as throughout all her life she had never doubted that the priests had the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Now she was asking herself: ‘Why do they never mention the name Jehovah? Why do they keep the Bible to themselves? Why do they say the soul is immortal if the Bible says it can die?’ You can imagine our joy when one day our patience was rewarded by her asking us to talk to her about the Bible and Jehovah, saying: ‘I do not know how to read, but I can listen and I am beginning to believe that the Catholics do not have all the truth after all.’ Now, a few months later, my mother is a zealous publisher along with my two sisters, and soon they will join my wife and me by symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah. How glad we are that we did not keep quiet even when there was no response at first!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">RODRIGUES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,250</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 4,050</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the start of the service year a sister and her daughter had to leave the island due to a change in her husband’s work. This left the two pioneers to look after the twenty to thirty interested families. So far no local person has taken up the preaching work, but a good foundation is being laid. Every six months the circuit servant visits them and stays with them in between the visits of the one boat that sails between Mauritius and Rodrigues every six weeks. After his last visit he reported that two group studies had now been arranged, with a peak attendance of fifty-nine persons. While on the island the circuit servant gives a public talk each week and the response is excellent. The Anglican priest forbade all his parishioners to attend the meetings, which caused a great stir among the flock. Some went to him to ask him why he did not want them to listen to the Bible. One lady read the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Word—Who Is He? According to John </span><span class="font9">and went to show him that the Trinity was not Scriptural. After two or three visits of this nature the priest realized that he had made himself somewhat unpopular by being so dogmatic. For us, the result was a peak of thirty-six persons attending the afternoon meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MEXICO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 42,230,811</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 33,518 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,260</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Over the years Jehovah’s witnesses have been very active in the country of Mexico, and again they had a fine year in preaching the good news. On the average, there are 30,261 publishers of the Kingdom preaching from house to house every month. More than 5,000,000 hours have been devoted to talking to the people about God’s kingdom. The new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> was greatly appreciated and has had a wide distribution; in fact, this year has been the very best year for the distribution of bound books in Mexico. The people are still listening, and it is the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses to give them every opportunity. This God’s servants in Mexico are trying to do. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“During my service as a pioneer I have had the pleasure of helping many persons. One young lady that I studied with told me at first, ‘I’m very Catholic.’ I overcame her objections and started a study in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font9"> As the study progressed she acquired more knowledge. She was a member of Catholic Action and was obligated to attend mass, where she took advantage of the silence and prepared for her study. She said that she continued to attend church but did not use images in praying and asked it that was correct. I told her that she would have to decide about the matter, but God’s Word says: ‘What agreement does God’s temple have with idols?’ We continued studying and she finally resigned from Catholic Action. She started to preach and later was baptized. The following month she became a vacation pioneer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The case of a family of nine brings to mind the experience of Cornelius the centurion. This family of nine for many years were members of the Pentecostal Church, but it seemed to them that there was something lacking in the church, and when the minister did something that was unworthy of a minister the mother decided to stop going to church. For fourteen years she did not go to any church. Then one day she decided to go to a Protestant church to see if she could find something new. But she found the same thing as before, so from that day on she decided not to go anymore and just prayed in her own home. She kneeled down in a corner of a room and prayed to Jehovah (she knew this name) and asked him to direct her to the correct way. She never let her daughters go to church anymore. She had always been zealous for matters about God and she was sure that someday God would help her to see the truth. One day her brother was visiting her and they talked about many things including the need of worshiping God. He asked her if she would really be interested in learning about the Bible. She told him that that was her greatest desire in life, to have somebody explain the Bible to her. He told her that he was studying the Bible with a young lady and he would ask her to come and study with her. Soon the young lady came and studied with her, and now, after only a short time, three of the family are publishing. One of the daughters reports from twenty to twenty-five hours a month, and another, twelve hours a month. Now the congregation meetings are held in her home. She is very happy even though she has difficulties with her husband. She says that nobody will take away her zeal for serving Jehovah. She witnesses to everyone who comes to her home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother who had been very active in the service since 1940 became inactive for five years. A circuit assembly was held in a nearby town and due to loving encouragement from other brothers he attended all three days of the assembly. Upon hearing the practical counsel that was given and after seeing the new film “Everlasting Good News,” he could see the progress of the organization. This made him think positively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the assembly he said: “I thought that I was getting along all right without the organization, but now I have no other alternative than to continue serving Jehovah.” He is now a zealous publisher again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MOROCCO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,594,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 108 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 116,611</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As one looks at the figures above it is easy to understand that a vast territory and a great population confront the publishers of the Kingdom in Morocco. One often wonders how the good news of God’s kingdom will reach this great multitude of people who are steeped in traditions and false religion. These people are not being educated in Christendom and they look at life altogether different from individuals who have had the opportunity of reading the Bible. It is very difficult to help them to gain a knowledge of the truth. The only consolation Jehovah’s witnesses have in this matter is that Jehovah knows who are his “sheep,” and he has told his servants to go and disciple people of all nations; and we are confident that his “sheep” will be gathered regardless of nationality, language or tribe. So, as the Kingdom message penetrates into these lands, it is with keen interest that we watch the results. Here are a few experiences that have taken place in Morocco and Gibraltar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister who owns a road construction company has a brother working for her. The sister and brother often witness to other employees about Jehovah’s purposes. Among those witnessed to was a Jewish surveyor who never wanted to listen to the message. One day he was sent out to survey the land for new roads deep in the interior untouched by Western culture. Since there were no hotels, the chief of the village showed his hospitality by asking him to stay with him in his home. The surveyor asked the chief if he had something to read. The reply came that he had nothing to read except one book in Arabic. Since the surveyor knew Arabic, he asked for the book. He was amazed to find in this village, many miles from electricity and Western civilization, a copy of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book. Since he had no other choice, he was obliged to read the book and take in the Kingdom message many miles from his employer and other Witnesses. When he asked the chief how he obtained the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book, he said he got it while visiting in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A special pioneer working in the Arab quarters found a European who already had obtained the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens”</span><span class="font9"> books. The special pioneer took advantage of the situation to start a study with the man, using the literature he had. This person proved to have such great interest in the truth that he was willing to study three times a week. He soon started to attend all the meetings and made fine progress in knowledge and appreciation of the truth. He began witnessing to all that would give him a listening ear. Being an elderly person, he almost died when he got sick. But when he recovered from his illness, he asked to be baptized. Now he is one of the many that give praise to Jehovah regularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The growth can be seen not only by the increased numbers of baptized persons but also in the personal decisions that have to be made from day to day. A person who was studying for four years was told that she would need an operation on her heart, for there was an obstructed valve. The doctor in the hospital told her that it would be necessary to have a blood transfusion for this operation. Having an idea that this problem might come up, she prepared herself. She told her family that if the blood question came up she would not take the transfusion. When the doctor heard that the publisher would not accept blood, he became very indignant. He told her that she would not be able to find a doctor anywhere that would do the operation without blood. 'The publisher still refused. The doctor was so angry that he sent her home. The next day a specialist arrived from London and called the sister to the hospital. After examining her he said that he would be willing to do the operation without blood—to the great embarrassment of the local doctor. Before the operation the publisher was baptized. Just a few weeks ago the operation was performed successfully without blood. The sister is doing fine and is anxiously waiting to be able to attend meetings and share in the field service to show her devotion to the great Life-giver, Jehovah.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Good work has been done in the Netherlands by the overseers and their assistants to help the flock of God to stay together. As we recognize that these are very trying times, everything must be done by those who are strong to help those who are weak to grow to maturity. The assistance that the overseers are showing toward the “other sheep” has held back somewhat the flooding tide of complacency, and in the case of many there has been a reactivating to the worship of Jehovah God through the assistance of the circuit servants. Now our brothers in the Netherlands have received with enthusiasm the fine book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie” </span><span class="font10">Undoubtedly this will help the publishers in establishing more Bible studies in the Netherlands during the coming year. Here are some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">A special pioneer wrote that he placed fifteen books with one spiritually hungry person whom he had found during a summer campaign in unassigned territory. The man was a subscriber to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> but because of his being a showman in “Holiday on Ice,” together with his wife, he never had time and could hardly be found home. At last a telephone appointment was made by the persistent special pioneer. The first evening a Bible study was started. They both progressed quickly and attended the convention in Rotterdam in 1965. They made time to study by quitting their well-paid job in the show business and starting to do some fur farming on their own. When the 1966 Amsterdam convention was held in the RAI hall, the place where he formerly had worked in many a show, the doorkeeper could not believe his eyes on seeing him there at the convention. He had to read the name on the badge before he really’ believed that this was the former clown in the “Holiday on Ice” show. Since the convention he has become a regular meeting attendee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Incidental witnessing during convention travels is a source of rich blessings. On the trip to Munich in 1963 a Witness couple talked to a couple who wanted to eat in the dining car of the train but were disappointed because the train happened to have none. They told them that ‘man should not live on bread alone' and gave a witness with an invitation to the Munich convention. A few years later the Witness couple received a letter from a brother and a sister. They had found out the address of the brother and now they wrote him to tell about their happiness in being in the truth, thanks to their train conversation and the enthusiastic invitation to visit the convention, which they accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If children are alert they can make the best of their opportunities too. A young brother was asked by his teacher on Monday what he had been doing on Sunday. He had seen him a few times in the neighborhood of his home with some other people. The youth took this opportunity to give a short witness about his preaching work on Sunday and the meeting. Some time later this same young brother worked a territory in which he knew three of his teachers lived, including the one who had asked him questions. A little shaky at first, he rang the doorbell, and the teacher personally answered the door. Positively he offered the magazines, which were accepted. This encouraged him so greatly that right away he went to the other two teachers in the territory, and they also took literature. When the new magazines came out, he again went to these three teachers, and they showed more interest. At first he thought that it could be that they took the magazines only because he was their pupil, but not so. When he finished elementary school and said good-bye to his teachers, they said that it was not necessary to shake hands with him because they would still see him every fourteen days with the new magazines. He still brings them their magazines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 552</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses are pleased with the progress of the work in Curasao during the past service year. They averaged a new all-time peak of 247 publishers of the good news. They are pleased, too, because they devoted more hours to the field service than any other year. However, they know that the witness is not finished by any means, because they are still meeting people who are coming into the truth and dedicating their lives to the service of God. The branch office located in Willemstad, Curasao, also looks after the work on the islands of Aruba and Bonaire. Here are some reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A native sister, vacation pioneering in April, told about calling at a home while doing magazine work Saturday morning. The man of the house took two magazines and then called his wife, saying: “Here is a girl we can trust.” The man explained that he and his wife are both schoolteachers and needed a trustworthy girl to keep house and look after their children. The sister told them she would not be free to take a job until the end of the month, but they said they would wait. Now the sister has a nice job, and the family treat her like a member of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the July 1966 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> suggested that it is good for someone in the congregation to have his telephone listed in the telephone book under “Jehovah’s Witnesses,” it was good counsel. A brother here in Curasao has his telephone listed under “Jehovah’s Witnesses,” and it has brought fine results. One lady called up and asked for a Bible. The lady not only got her Bible but a Bible study too. A family that came back to Curacao from Holland called to say that they had had a study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book in Holland and would like to continue the study here. It is a fine study; the whole family, father, mother and two children all attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall, and the mother is now talking about baptism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 151 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 392</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past service year we had some very fine assemblies in Aruba, and these have contributed to the witness given. The publishers in Aruba love assemblies and they are always saying that the assemblies are too short or they do not come fast enough. At many assemblies in Aruba a certain elderly brother, a barber, has someone he studies with baptized. At the last assembly he was asked to explain his success in bringing people to dedication and baptism. He said that when he makes an appointment for a study or a back-call he puts forth a special effort to keep the appointment and to be on time. If seven o’clock is the time for a study and the student holds up the study by not being ready, he still stops the study at eight o’clock when the hour should have been up. He says that this helps to impress on the student the seriousness of the study. He begins with prayer even from the first study. (That is not too difficult in his territory.) He requires that the student prepare his lesson in advance. The brother recognizes that he can only plant and water the seed of truth while Jehovah makes it grow, but he is of the opinion that Jehovah is more disposed to bless a diligent effort.—1 Cor. 3:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BONAIRE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,908</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 288</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Most of the people in Bonaire are Catholic, but now an Evangelical group have put up a powerful radio station on Bonaire called Trans World Radio. When we call on the people, many of them ask if we are associated with Trans World Radio. When we say that we are not, the people want to know why. Then we have to explain to them the difference between Babylonish religion and the truth. On our explaining the Trinity doctrine to one educated man, he exclaimed: “The religious organizations have pushed Jehovah the Father into the background and put all the emphasis on Jesus, the Son.” The theme of Trans World Radio is “Accept Jesus as your personal savior.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWFOUNDLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The work of making disciples of people of all the nations has been assigned to Jehovah’s dedicated witnesses. This is indeed a good work and there is nothing better for a man to do than to work hard at it. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere know the scripture at Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13: “I have come to know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during one’s life; and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work. It is the gift of God.” No matter where one lives in the earth today he should feel the urgency of doing God’s work well and soon. Not only is the work urgent, but it is also very rewarding and satisfying to Jehovah’s witnesses. In this northern island the work progresses, and here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many of the brothers have been using the direct approach as suggested in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> in which a home Bible study is offered without cost or obligation on the part of the householder. Many home Bible studies have been started in this way. Some have been discontinued after two or three studies, but others are still being conducted. This approach was used by others on their regular magazine route calls. What was the result? The following experience will help us to see: “For some time I have been calling on a man in my territory, leaving with him the latest copies of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazines. He always readily accepted them but would not invite me into his home. He showed unusual interest and I often wondered why he would not allow me into his home. The next time I called I was determined to show him the importance of home Bible study and explain what it would mean to him and his family of ten children. What was his problem? He felt that his home was not good enough or large enough for a Bible study. He said, however, that he believed that Jehovah’s witnesses were the witnesses spoken of in the Bible and he wanted to learn the truth with their help. He then took me to the back of his home, where he showed me a small building under construction and proceeded to explain what he had in mind. When the building would be completed, he explained, he would invite a representative of the Watch Tower Society to come to his home to study the Bible with him and his family. He wants to learn the truth and win the approval of Jehovah and is happy for the assistance given by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The weather in Newfoundland is not always suitable for the door-to-door ministry, especially in the cold winter months. It is just about impossible to visit some of the interested ones during the stormy winter weather. In cases like this arrangements are made to conduct correspondence Bible study courses. A publisher explains her joy in this service when she writes: “It gives me the greatest joy to conduct a home Bible study by mail with an interested lady who is the mother of six children ranging in age from two to thirteen. She makes time for study and answers all the questions I give her and accompanies each lesson with a letter expressing appreciation for what she is learning. In one of her letters to me she wrote: ‘Thank you for starting this Bible study course with me. I think I am going to enjoy it very much.’ In another letter she says: ‘I wish I could join you at your Kingdom Hall in some of your studies. Maybe one of these days my prayers will be answered. I know as we proceed further along in this study I will gain a better knowledge of the truth. I know, too, that I must study to gain this knowledge.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Since I had outlined a lot of Bible reading for her to do, I asked her if I was going too fast. But she replied: ‘No, you are not going too fast; I just make the time for my study. I find it very interesting and I do most of my reading by night while waiting for my husband to come from work. I know Jehovah will bless me in my efforts to understand his Word of truth. I am looking forward to receiving the next study lesson.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the highlights of the year came with Brother Knorr’s visit to Newfoundland in conjunction with the district assembly held in Corner Brook; 1,284 attended the public talk, which was the best attendance for any assembly in Newfoundland. The assembly was outstanding in every way and will long be remembered by our brothers in Newfoundland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW ZEALAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,676,919</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,730 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 566</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another good witness concerning God’s kingdom was given to the people of New Zealand by Jehovah’s witnesses. A new peak in the number of Bible studies was reached, and the brothers are hoping to reap good results from this during the next twelve months. As the brothers concluded the service year in New Zealand they made mention of how much they enjoyed the “God’s Sons of Liberty” assemblies, and say that the days they spent at the assembly put new life into all the brothers. They are aware of their spiritual needs and are grateful for all the provisions made by the faithful and discreet slave, which operates under the direction of Jehovah God and by his holy spirit. The brothers are happy in New Zealand, and the branch servant sends some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">History was made on the last day of the service year when, at the invitation of the New Zealand Broadcasting Service, we were allotted fifteen minutes on the national radio network to explain our beliefs on a program entitled “I Believe.” We were among nine smaller religious groups who shared in this series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The year was also climaxed with two “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies. A number who missed the first of these heard such glowing reports about the program that they decided to attend the second assembly. Overflow crowds were served by closed-circuit television. One family who sold the family car to pay for the trip considered the sacrifice well worth the benefits gained. Warm applause sounded from 3,500 grateful brothers and sisters when it became known that the prompt, loving service of our brothers in Brooklyn had made it possible for an urgent order of the new book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God</span><span class="font9"> to arrive in time for release at the assembly, the books actually being cleared from the ship while the assembly was in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our joyful spiritual prosperity provokes Satan’s anger. Aware of such danger, wise publishers prepare newly interested ones for the opposition they may meet. One sister found this paid off when she started a Bible study with an interested woman. All the woman’s family were against her except one nineteen-year-old son, who said: “Carry on, Mum; I know that what you’re doing is right.” Various ones of her friends would arrive during the Bible study and seek to hinder it, raising questions on blood transfusion or neutrality. Forewarned, she was undisturbed and simply invited her friends to sit in on the study, but they declined. Finally the clergyman from her church called one day and opened his visit with the remark: “I believe you have someone worrying you,” to which she replied: “Oh! Not at all.” When he asked if Jehovah’s witnesses were calling on her, she said it was true but that it was not “worrying” her. Rather, she was enjoying it. He tried to say that Jehovah’s witnesses use only the Hebrew Scriptures, but she quickly showed from the study booklet that the entire Bible is studied. Next, he unsuccessfully urged support for a Bible discussion group at the church. This sheeplike person has already expressed a desire to share in discipling others and continues to be fed and protected from the “wolves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Watering seeds of truth very soon after sowing promotes spiritual growth. One Monday a sister engaging in field service met a young mother of five children whose tragic, unhappy past had left her despondent and without hope. The wonderful promises of the Kingdom blessings obviously struck a responsive chord. Although hesitant about making a return visit so soon, the sister called on Thursday and a study was started, the woman commenting that she had never before had her questions answered from the Bible so clearly. Another call was made on Friday to draw attention to the subject of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">study for Sunday and to leave a copy. Was it too early to be inviting this person to the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study? Not at all. Not only did she attend that first Sunday, but has attended meetings ever since and in a matter of months has become a publisher sharing the message of hope with others. Prompt and regular watering of the seed stimulated fruitfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A month of vacation pioneering can lead to a grand future. After receipt of the March 15 pioneer letter, the wife of a circuit servant was moved to write the Branch a letter of appreciation. She recalled how thrilled she was when vacation pioneering was first introduced and how she quickly applied for this privilege. In that first month she obtained thirty-four subscriptions and started five new Bible studies. From that first taste of vacation pioneer service her joy increased, along with her love for Jehovah and the brothers. Pioneering became her goal. As her young family of five grew up she planned ahead for pioneer service. Eagerly she sought out pioneers at assemblies and discussed their experiences with them. She and her husband talked about it constantly. One by one the family grew up and entered pioneer service. At last regular pioneering became a reality for the parents. Then in 1959 they were invited into special pioneer service, and in 1965 her husband was appointed to circuit work. Counting her blessings past and present, the sister says it was all “because of that first wonderful month of vacation pioneering so many years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NICARAGUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,725,525</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: </span><span class="font9">822 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,099</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Nicaragua certainly had a banner year. They had seven consecutive peaks in publishers, and the final result was that they had a 21-percent increase in the organization in Nicaragua. We appreciate, too, that a heavy responsibility falls upon them now to help make these newly interested people mature and to give proper guidance and direction to those who have just taken their stand on Jehovah’s side and have become proclaimers of the good news. They know that if they do not build with gold, silver and precious stones their work will go up in smoke when the fire test comes, so they are going to do their best to aid these new Witnesses to build on a right foundation. They appreciate, too, that there is still much more witnessing to be done, and undoubtedly Jehovah has helped the servants there raise up these additional Witnesses so that a greater coverage of the territory could be made during the remaining years to proclaim the good news. The branch servant gives us some very fine observations, and they are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We may feel that not too much interest is shown when a magazine is placed and, therefore, a back-call would not be profitable. But recently the branch office asked a missionary sister what was the one most outstanding contributing factor in her having been able to help seventy-four persons start publishing in the last ten years. We were surprised when she said: “We did a lot of magazine work, and I kept making back-calls on all magazines placed until </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font9"> was able to start Bible studies with them. Then I would encourage them to join me in magazine work as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Servants of the congregations are certainly to be commended for their supervision leading to growth and spiritual prosperity. For seven years one congregation reported from twenty to thirty publishers. It did not grow. Why? At first the servants did not understand their duties and were lacking in knowledge and organizational training. Changes were made and instructions given. Now, during the past four months, over seventy publishers are reporting a monthly average of nearly thirteen hours each. Personal attention was the deciding factor. And how the brothers appreciate encouragement from the servants! One sister was heard to remark: “I really feel that I’m a member of the congregation now. My overseer visited me last night and we had such a fine visit together.” This overseer is more interested in the “sheep” than in just making a good service record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus, overseers are finding it fruitful to spend more time with publishers and former publishers even though it may mean less time devoted to the service. Another overseer located a “prodigal son” who had not attended meetings for more than five years. He confessed that he had attended meetings of other religions, but he could not find peace of mind. The overseer adjusted his busy schedule and started a Bible study with him. In a short time he was attending meetings again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no substitute for loving personal assistance. With multitudinous duties to perform a servant may easily forget some details; but if he has true interest in his brothers and spends as much of his time as possible with them, the work will prosper, because “a true companion is loving all the time.”—Prov. 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NIGERIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 55,620,268</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 43,738 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 1,272</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This great country of Nigeria in Africa has been in the news recently because of political disturbances, armed revolts, lawlessness and tribal violence. There are certain individuals in the country who have been fanning and exploiting tribal jealousies and hatreds to explosive heat. Three times during the year the seething caldron erupted. While greatly affecting the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, these troubles are also helping to awaken many indifferent ones to the truth that Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching. The violence and strife have brought into sharper focus the neutral stand of Jehovah’s witnesses. Many people are getting to see that God’s servants are the only ones absolutely neutral in this world’s disputes. The branch office has some experiences from Nigeria, Fernando Poo, Niger and Rio Muni.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to our zealous preaching activity and our neutral position with respect to this world, we gain a favorable testimony from those on the outside by the way we conduct ourselves in our private lives and on our secular jobs. In one of the big cities of the Western Region the police were investigating a big theft case recently. All the clerks were summoned to a police station. Warrants were prepared. Among the seven clerks was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The clerks were brought before a law officer with their warrants for signature. Incidentally, this law officer was at one time having a Bible study in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font9"> and the person who conducted it was the brother now before him. The law officer said to the policeman: “I have signed all the warrants except the one for this man (pointing to the brother), whom I guarantee, for I know he cannot be involved in this sort of thing. Go, make a thorough investigation, and if he is in the least involved in the crime, bring back the warrant for my signature.” The brother was allowed to go. The police made their investigation and found that the brother was not involved at all. Instead, the manager of the store gave a very good report about him and recommended him very highly. The police, very much surprised, went back to report to the law officer, and wanted to know from him how he knew beforehand that the particular man could not be involved, because “the manager has a very high regard for him.” Then the law officer said: “I know him as a preacher of Jehovah’s witnesses, and it is this sort of thing they are preaching against and warning people about!” So it is good to let our light shine. God is glorified when they see our fine works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Though physical disabilities may restrict or handicap us, we do not let them silence our preaching of the good news. A thirty-three-year-old brother who is confined to a leper settlement spreads the Kingdom hope among others who share his unfortunate circumstances. The local Baptist preacher heard of his activities and immediately mounted a propaganda campaign to silence the brother. When they would have religious discussions in the settlement, the brother would ask Bible questions, such as: ‘If, as you say, all the good people will go to heaven, then what will become of this earth, which God took so many years to create?’ Not being able to give a Scriptural answer, the preacher would turn to his church members for support, but they proved to be just as helpless. The white manager excused himself by saying that he is not an authority on the Bible. From that time on more persons turned from the church, despite the fact that the preacher influenced the manager to use pressure to get all to come to church. Greater opposition followed, and the brother was isolated .from contact with all others in the settlement. However, an assignment came that needed a trustworthy person to be put in charge. No reliable person could be found except the brother. Upon being offered the position, the brother accepted, with one condition: that he be allowed to exercise his faith freely by preaching as before. This was granted, and the result is that eleven persons now associate together for weekly Bible study. Two persons are ready for immersion, one of whom is an illiterate who is being helped to read and write.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Pioneers have helped greatly in stabilizing the work and speeding up the increase, as can be seen in the following experiences. Said one: “For two years I have preached among the 250 fellow workers in the camp but did not succeed in adding a new person to the number making up the group. To my surprise and joy, during the first ten days of my pioneer service the four young men with whom I lived for these years began to respond and a Bible study was organized. It was not long before all four shared in the preaching work, and all are now active as dedicated Witnesses. This came as a result of my improved schedule and increased zeal.” When a pioneer brother and a dedicated publisher began working at Biapa Concepcion eighteen months ago, there were no other publishers there. Today, despite the distance from one farm to another, there are fifteen sharing the Kingdom hope with others and two pioneers helping them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The increase in the territory has not gone unnoticed by the Devil. Although the brothers are becoming quite tactful, the Catholic priests have continued to use the police and soldiers to intimidate the brothers. During the year a tribal chief began associating with the Witnesses, and this caused much concern to the priests, who arranged for soldiers to break up the meeting and arrest the Witnesses. This plan was frustrated, as the brothers moved to a different location for their meeting upon learning of the plot. This congregation is enjoying a fine increase, although they have to move from one location to another to avoid the enemy. Only truly interested persons are informed of the place of meeting,</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">We now have eight Nigerian special pioneers in this newly opened territory. Their experiences show that, as Paul said in 2 Corinthians 6:4-6: “In every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers . . . by kindness.” A special pioneer was studying the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book with a devout Catholic man. After </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> while the student stumbled over the Scriptural facts about Christmas and ordered the special pioneer to stop coming to his house. “Why am I fooling myself?” he said. “My parents’ religion is good enough for me.” Some weeks afterward the man was admitted to hospital, very sick. No one visited him there despite his undergoing two operations. “Where, now, is the Reverend Father?” he wondered. News came to the special pioneer. He promptly visited him, even slept in the hospital with him and cared for his meals. As the man recuperated, the special pioneer had the wonderful opportunity of reviving the study. He soon came to feel that his parents’ religion is no longer good enough for him. When discharged from the hospital, the man began attending meetings regularly. A visiting circuit servant went along with the special pioneer to the study at the man’s home. After the study the man called his family together and advised them all to pursue the course of life with Jehovah’s witnesses, for he now knows them to be God’s ministers. The whole family is now associating with the isolated group, and the man and one of his daughters have started out in the service.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Through the zealous activity of the publishers the message is now reaching the natives of this land. At Mbarabum, near Bata the capital, a family head gathered members of his family and asked that a weekly Bible study be conducted with them. Progress was noted by a neighbour, who sent for the Witness conducting the study. This lady was disturbed at why the Witness did not call on her for a similar study, and so another study was started. At another village a middle-aged woman follows the publishers as they engage in the preaching work. Although not yet having enough knowledge to be considered a publisher, she feels she should identify herself with this religion while a regular Bible study is held with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">NORWAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;3,738,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Despite the very good witness that was given in Norway during the service year by the publishers and the pioneers, and even though there were many new publishers starting in the service, there has been no increase in the number of Jehovah’s witnesses proclaiming the good news. The reason for this is that many who were once active have stepped aside. We regret very much to see brothers forsake the assembling of themselves together with God’s servants, and, of course, when they stop assembling they stop preaching the good news to others so that they might gain salvation. The circuit servants in Norway along with the overseers in the con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">gregations are cognizant of this fact and they are doing everything they can to show the brothers the importance of attending meetings and keeping strong spiritually. It may be that now that they have just received the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font10"> book some of the interest on the part of the weaker ones will be rekindled; we hope so. It is interesting to note that in the last five years the average number of publishers has increased 439, but at the same time there were 983 baptized. So 500 more have definitely stated that they want to serve God, but it appears that some who have been serving God have lost their interest. Here are some interesting experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A dedicated sister who had not been sharing in the ministry or attending meetings during the past ten years was visited by the circuit servant and his wife. They carried the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> issues dealing with the parable of the prodigal son, and Jehovah’s great mercy and loving-kindness were discussed. The sister was so much encouraged by the visit that she started to attend meetings again, and more calls were made at her home. When the circuit servant and his wife had to leave this congregation, another publisher was assigned to help her further. Later on, the circuit servant’s wife received a letter from this previously inactive sister, saying: “I can hardly believe that I have been fortunate enough to learn the truth once more, but now I really understand that Jehovah is a merciful and loving God. I have to read and study a lot, because there are so many things that I don’t remember. It is just like starting all over again. But I pray to Jehovah for help and strength, and I am fully determined to carry on in his service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here is another experience showing that “lost sheep” are happy to return. A family accepted the truth many years ago, and the wife succeeded in helping some of her closest relatives to accept the truth too. After some years of zealous service the family moved to another place, and the relatives who once had accepted the truth were now falling away. In time the original family also fell away from the truth. Many years later they moved back to the place where they had first learned the truth, and the local congregation servant called on them to tell them that both Jehovah and the whole congregation would be very happy if they would come back. They were happy to see Jehovah’s mercy and loving-kindness and accepted a Bible study. The husband said that despite having prospered materially they had felt the emptiness that followed when they left the truth. The wife said: “I helped my relatives to learn the truth and start out in Jehovah’s service the first time, and now I will try to do it the second time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An eighty-four-year-old sister could no longer share in the house-to-house ministry because of infirmity due to weak legs. Of course, she did not want to stop preaching for that reason. As a former schoolteacher she was well acquainted with writing, and she decided to write letters. She could write as many as forty letters a month. With each letter she enclosed a magazine or a booklet, and she also stated her telephone number, so that interested persons could call her. For two years she kept writing letters, with no one paying heed. Then one day a man called, referring to a letter he had received, and said that he would like her to answer some questions. An appointment was made to call on him, and a brother took the sister with him in his car to visit this interested person. He was sincerely interested, and a study was started. He is making very fine progress in the truth and is very enthusiastic about what he is learning. This old sister was indeed blessed because of her perseverance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The highlight of the year for our brothers in these little islands south of Japan was the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly. While they have only 225 publishers on the island, at the public meeting they had the grand attendance of 360, and all the publishers rejoiced over this. There is still much to do in declaring the good news and helping people to be disciples of Christ Jesus. Many of the people on these islands have never heard anything about the Bible, and to convince these people that the Bible is the Word of the true God really takes patience on the part of the publishers and the ability to teach. However, the truth is reaching them, and Jehovah’s witnesses are making good progress in helping those who see the truth to become mature and to hold fast to the things they have learned. A branch office is now established in Okinawa, and a report is given here of the work done in the islands of Sakishima Gunto also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young schoolgirl from Koza City was asked to participate in flag waving and dancing when the national anthem was being sung. When she refused she was called before the principal of the school twice. She was able to explain her stand from the Scriptures and took her stand in spite of their yelling in her face. Later the principal respected her for her stand and became friendly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another sister requiring a serious operation refused blood. Remembering Jesus’ words at Matthew 10:39, “He that loses his soul for my sake will find it,” she prayed. Would they operate? After much discussion with her and her husband, who, though not in the truth, was cooperative, they agreed to use a substitute. Result? Success! She is well now and is praising Jehovah more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another experience is from a schoolteacher who had to maintain his neutrality in regard to politics, elections and demonstrations staged by teachers here. In spite of what was said about him, and their pointing fingers at him, he maintained his Christian neutrality and integrity. Now they all respect him for his stand. He is school servant in the congregation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">During August, twenty-one publishers from these islands attended the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly held in Okinawa Gunto. They were greatly strengthened by the association and spiritual food received, and returned home determined to serve with greater zeal. As soon as they reached home, the brothers on one of the main islands, Miyako, were visited by typhoon Cora. While making this report, we received word from our brothers, saying: “With rain and wind up to 150 miles an hour at times, which kept on blowing for 30 hours, our house shook like a basket, and it was a dreadful experience, hard to describe. The houses around us were practically all destroyed. The brothers are all safe.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The service year for Jehovah’s witnesses commenced with the nation at war and emergency measures being taken throughout the country. This was a new experience for the brothers in Pakistan. However, they continued to attend meetings and share in the ministry. When hostilities ceased, the Kingdom publishers scattered throughout this vast Moslem territory were found continuing to work patiently to make disciples. A good witness was given, with some new ones sharing in the ministry. The branch servant in Lahore gives us a report on what was done in Pakistan and also Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Conducting a study by mail with someone a thousand miles away is as thrilling and rewarding as by any other method.” So writes a missionary sister. “Our one elderly sister in East Pakistan, who herself learned the truth by correspondence, left the country some time ago to be with her children, but not without first planting a seed of truth in the heart of a Catholic woman. She put me in touch with this Catholic lady and I wrote, suggesting a Bible study by mail. In the meantime a brother from West Pakistan who was over there on business was able to visit the lady and leave a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book with her. However, due to severe floods, she was forced to change her address, and as she had also lost my address, our contact was broken. Imagine my joy when three years later I received a letter from her. She had again found my address and said: ‘I think you know that there are none of Jehovah’s witnesses in Chittagong except me, so please help me by sending a Bible and magazines for guidance.’ During the past months I have been able to send her literature and conduct a regular Bible study. In a recent letter she expressed her gratitude to Jehovah for leading her to the truth after her years of searching. She has a family of thirteen to care for and very little material means. However, on her own she has been teaching her children from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book, doing her own study after ten o’clock at night when her work is done. Her answers to my Bible questions are a joy to read, dictated to her eldest son, who writes for her, as she says her own writing is not so good. So a study by mail is caring for this humble person living among more than fifty million people among whom little witnessing has ever been done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A firm determination to expand one’s ministry, even if this is possible only for a short time, is certain to bring Jehovah’s blessing. This was the experience of a sister who writes concerning vacation pioneering: “I have not been well for some years now and especially since 1963, when I last vacation pioneered. Since then each year has passed and I kept waiting until I felt well enough to vacation pioneer, as this was my keen desire. Finally, feeling no better, in February I decided that, sickness or no sickness, I must vacation pioneer again this year, and so I sent in my application. I must say that I never enjoyed good health for such a long period as I did during the month I pioneered, forgetting at times that there was anything wrong with me. I am grateful to the brothers who helped me reach my goal and to my family, who cooperated with the housework, making it possible for me to have such an enjoyable time. I am grateful to Jehovah for blessing my service, as I was able to put in 126 hours, place 252 magazines and obtain 21 new subscriptions. I am looking forward to sharing in vacation pioneering again and would like to encourage all to share in this grand privilege of service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Circuit assembly programs are valuable aids in imparting knowledge and help in the ministry. A missionary brother relates: “My wife was conducting a Bible study with a young couple. After a while the wife introduced her sister and her husband to us and they also enthusiastically started studying. However, a friend turned this second couple away from studying by saying that Jehovah’s witnesses did not believe in Christ, that they were Communists and that they would have a lot of ‘bad luck’ if they continued. After this, whenever I went for the study the curtains were drawn and the lights out. About this time our circuit assembly program featured the part on ‘Starting and Continuing Bible Studies.’ I listened carefully to the part on preparing new ones for opposition, fitting this couple into the situation. By chance, on the Sunday morning of the assembly I met this second couple at the home of the first couple and, with the demonstration fresh in mind, I discussed with them the scripture at Luke 12:53, showing that opposition was to be expected. This second couple were sorry that they had stopped the study and said that they had felt guilty when pretending not to be at home when I called. It had so happened that the so-called ‘bad luck’ had come only when they had stopped studying, the reverse of what they had been told. I am now conducting an interesting and progressive study with this couple twice a week, at their request.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AFGHANISTAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 13,500,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The small group of brothers serving in this country have a difficult assignment to work, but they have done well in giving a witness during the year. Two of the brothers were able to share in vacation pioneer service. The usual methods of field service can be used only among the foreign community, and the overseer relates: “People nice to talk to are very seldom met, so what a privilege we have in our association with the organization of the living God.” The group is well organized, holding meetings regularly, also meetings for field service. They support these well. Every occasion is used to give a witness, one brother making a copy of his talk and giving it to the son of a clergyman. This individual was astonished to know that such good talks were held. Sometimes talks are prepared in English in the hope that interested persons will attend. They are commenced in German when it is found that only the brothers are present, for they know German better; then halfway through, when an interested person arrives, the speaker changes to English. One sister kindly cared for the three children of an acquaintance for a time; and after hearing God’s Word discussed daily, one little girl remarked: “Because I now know who Jehovah is, I prayed to him yesterday.” The brothers have been able to attend the circuit and district assemblies in Pakistan, and this summer one sister visited Europe and attended the “God’s Sons of Liberty” assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PANAMA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;1,286,700</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The witnesses of Jehovah in Panama had a very good year in theocratic activity. An excellent witness was given throughout the whole land. The back-call and Bible study work was emphasized and, in addition to this, many more hours were spent in the field service than during any previous year. Very little opposition has been encountered in the field ministry, but there has been strong opposition against the schoolchildren, and some of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses have been expelled. Others have been allowed by certain teachers to stand quietly or go to another room while the flag-salute ceremony is conducted. So the children in Panama are bearing the brunt of the opposition at the moment. Here are a few reports sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Parents have been encouraged to teach their children the true religion, and it has brought fine results, as the following experience shows: One day a secretary from an office nearby called at the Branch for some literature. A friend had been witnessing to her and aroused her interest in the truth, although she was a Catholic and her two sons were in a Catholic school. One of the missionaries started a Bible study with her during her lunch hour, and they studied several times a week while her place of work was nearby. Of course, she began to teach her children what she was learning, and both mother and boys have made fine progress. One day when the mother arrived home from work she found that the boys had cleaned out all their desk drawers. They had thrown out the “saints,” crosses, pictures and religious medals and said they did not want to go to mass anymore. they wanted to go to the Kingdom Hall instead. Arrangements were soon made to take them out of the Catholic private school, and within a short time all three became publishers of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since Brother Knorr’s visit last December to make arrangements for the “God’s Sons of Liberty” assembly, interest has been growing fast, and now as the year draws to a close the brothers are looking forward and planning for this big international event set for December, and they are working hard to be on hand for it. A circuit servant sent in the following about one family that is preparing to be present. A child not even in school yet, hearing his parents talking about the coming assembly, decided he should be saving for it also, and so he began picking coffee beans on a nearby farm. So far he has earned enough to pay his bus fare to the convention city and is still working to save more. Since the family lives out in an isolated section and all are planning to attend the assembly, the boy’s father said he did not know who would take care of the farm while they are away, but they are going right ahead with preparations with full faith and confidence in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PAPUA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;543,235</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The branch office in Papua looks after the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Papua as well as in Manus Island, New Britain, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The brothers scattered throughout this territory have had very interesting experiences during the past year. But the same problems exist in the islands that exist in the larger nations of the world. The moral situation is the same as elsewhere, and sometimes individuals in the organization become immoral and action must be taken to remove these persons from the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. Those who are looking after the work in Papua and the islands have put forth great effort to help the people get an understanding of the principles of truth and righteousness taught in God’s Word, but how easy it is for some to slip back. Even though there are these problems to be faced, the brothers have had some very fine experiences in Jehovah’s service and the branch servant relates some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sometimes we wonder whether we should witness to a group of people when calling in house-to-house work. Many blessings come to us if we tactfully take advantage of this situation to give a witness, as shown by the following experience: While witnessing from house to house a group of brothers came across a village that at first appeared to be deserted. However, closer examination showed that the village people were there, but that they were all congregated about the home of a deceased girl. The father of the girl was asked to come outside. When he did so, it was explained that this, above all times, was the time he needed comfort. The offer was made to go into the house and give all such comfort from the Scriptures. This was agreed to, and all went inside. In the midst of about thirty people, crowded around the body of the dead girl, the resurrection hope was given first. It was shown that Christians should not sorrow as those do without hope but should gain courage in the fact that Christ was raised. (1 Thess. 4:13) At the end of the sermon the immediate family were all happy about the comfort received, and a back-call was arranged. On the return call when a deacon of the local church tried to interfere, the older sister of the deceased, herself a mission teacher, kept muttering: “Go away. You never helped us like this when our sister died.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two special pioneers have begun making regular visits to the Opau area in the Gulf District and have had very good success. Fifteen studies are being conducted, and among them are four of the local witch doctor’s children! In spite of their father’s efforts to stop them, they are making good progress in the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Despite very bad weather in past months—nearly 130 inches of rain in eight months—the brothers have continued to give a good witness in this locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The most outstanding event for the brothers this service year was the granting by the government of a fine large block of land on which they can build their Kingdom Hall. Already the land has been cleared, foundations have been laid and prefabrication of the building has begun. We feel sure that much increase will come when the brothers get into their own Kingdom Hall.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Last year a mob from one of the local Catholic missions broke up a study one of the special pioneers had been holding with a Tolai man. Because of this man’s fear of the mob and the mission he did not continue with his study. However, during the past year he has had time to reflect on the situation, and he walked into Rabaul to see the special pioneer about his new attitude, saying that he had decided now to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. It seems that during the time he discontinued studying he spoke about the Bible with two pastors from the Methodist theological college and found them completely lacking in Bible knowledge. Following this experience he attended Easter services at the Methodist church but came away without any spiritual nourishment. At home he began to spend much time praying and reading the Bible along with the Society’s books. What was his decision? He told his wife: “I don’t care if our neighbors don’t like us; and if they want to persecute me along with the Witnesses, I don’t mind, because this is the road that will lead to life for me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the island of New Ireland, just a few miles from New Britain, much interest has developed over the past few years. Different brothers from Rabaul have gone to this island to work for short periods and have done a lot of witnessing. As the circuit servant passes through on his way to other congregations he has always stopped off to see these interested ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">During the year the flag-salute issue came up for the first time here. Seven children of local brothers attending a government school had been excused from saluting the flag on grounds of conscience. In March the local education authorities informed the congregation overseer that the children would be compelled to comply with instructions to salute the flag. The head teacher in the school told the children that in the future they would have to salute the flag or they would be expelled from school. They were told that they would be tested the following Monday morning at school parade. Monday came and the children did not salute. The following day the whole school of over 300 children was again paraded for the flag salute, and still the Witness children refused to compromise. They were then expelled from school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Request was made at once to the Director of Education that the children be accepted back at school at once. Three weeks passed and, as there was no response to the request, appeal was made to the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly and to the United Nations. Informed of the situation by a member of the House of Assembly, the administrator of the territory ordered the local education authorities to reenroll these students at once. Ele also told them that, as there is complete freedom of religion in this land, these children would not be forced to salute the flag. Jehovah’s witnesses have thus aided in establishing freedom of worship in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One village where Bible studies are conducted has received much opposition from the Lutheran mission. One day a Lutheran pastor formed a mob of about seventy men from another village. They came to the village where our brothers were studying to chase them out and to break down their Kingdom Hall. The special pioneer put the mob off balance by going outside the village to meet them. He was soon able to locate the pastor in the mob and began to talk with him. The brother was able to turn the talk to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the discussion that followed, the pioneer asked the pastor why the Lutheran mission says God’s name is “Anutu.” When the pastor said it was in the Bible, he was asked to show everyone where it says that this is God’s name. It was a very nervous man, with sweat dripping from his face, who, after some minutes, had to admit he could not find it. The pioneer called on him to read Psalm 83:18. He had to have assistance to find the book of Psalms, and then he began to read out loud. When he came to the name Jehovah he slammed the Bible shut and screamed, “That’s a lie!” Too late, he realized that he had said his own Bible was a lie. Many of those who had been a part of the mob expressed their appreciation for what they had learned and encouraged those studying to continue on. Once more Babylon the Great received a scratching when she tangled with Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">After many years of rapid increase it is not surprising that a point must be reached during which the organization secures gains made in the past. Such a situation has now occurred here. During past years quite a number of persons left Babylon the Great and came into association with Jehovah’s organization. Last year three new congregations were formed on Malaita Island, and this has meant a closer supervision of those associating. As a result of this, many of those who had associated but had not changed their lives decided it was too much of an effort to be a witness for Jehovah and so they stopped associating. Even though we have seen a decrease in numbers this year, much good work was done by the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a village near F--- two men who were clearly</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">demonized were much feared by the other few inhabitants of the village. This fear became so great that all the people ran away from the village, leaving the two men alone there. At this time Witnesses from F--- came to preach. The men were encouraged to</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">sit down and listen. Back-calls were made and a study was started. It was not long before changes were noticed both in conduct and in facial expression. The two were invited to come to live in F—— village, where they could attend all the meetings and receive further help. Both accepted and are now well on the way to becoming active publishers rid of all demon influence. Those who ran away from them cannot understand the great change that has taken place in their lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The outstanding event of the past year was the dedication of the new branch office and missionary home in Asuncion, Paraguay. These expanded facilities have made it possible for the organization to have more missionary help for the preaching of the good news. While there was a nice increase in the work done in Paraguay, still one of the problems we have is that brothers move to other countries, especially Argentina, in order to find work and to better their standard of living. But whether such ones are in Paraguay or Argentina or elsewhere, as long as they stay in Jehovah’s organization and preach the good news of the Kingdom, much good will be accomplished. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In this relatively tranquil land where one seldom hears of “natural disasters,” the endurance of the publishers and their desire to “preach the word ... in favorable season, in troublesome season” was put to the test during the past service year. For the first half of the service year heavy rains made the whole south of the country impassable for much of the time, severe and extensive flooding taking place as the rains progressed. Some of the brothers lost their livelihood as farms and crops went under water and cattle drowned or starved. One congregation saw their Kingdom Hall crumble into a heap as the waters undermined and washed away the foundation. In spite of it all, the reports of the activity of these brothers kept coming through as they continued to preach under these adverse conditions. Wrote the congregation servant of the worst-hit area: “Here we are then, all fine . . . Although there has been material damage, nothing hurts us spiritually.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Just what is there that might prevent a person from being a vacation pioneer at some time during the year?” asks the supplement on pioneer service in the February 1966 </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font9"> With full faith a somewhat sickly sister decided that her poor health was not a good enough reason for her not to enjoy the blessings of vacation pioneering for one month. She and her seven-year-old daughter embarked, with her husband’s cooperation, upon a program of one month’s intensive activity. As a result, she placed the entire backlog of the congregation’s 450 outdated magazines in working four distant, seldom-worked territories. She and her daughter would leave early in the morning and try to stay in these territories all day. She gave specific help to three fellow publishers who, for the first time, were able to reach their publisher’s goals of hours and magazines. The congregation was so encouraged by her good example that it averaged 15.9 hours and 16.6 magazines per publisher for that month, with 36 publishers reporting. Her final report showed 125 hours, 615 magazines, plus many back-calls and a new Bible study. Her daughter also worked 110 hours and placed 160 magazines. How did the sister’s health hold up? She was in much better physical condition when the month ended than when it began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PERU &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,014,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Peru recognize that it means salvation to participate in the Christian ministry. To keep busy in Jehovah’s service means real protection, and if we walk according to his will it means everlasting life. Just as Paul said: “But all things are from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of the reconciliation, namely, that God was by means of Christ reconciling a world to himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses, and he committed the word of the reconciliation to us.” (2 Cor. 5:18, 19) During the past year it has been the joy and privilege of the publishers in Peru to extend to right-hearted ones this message of reconciliation and to see hope spring up instead of despair in the hearts of many. These witnesses appreciate, too, the necessity on their part of staying close to Jehovah and doing his will now that they have been reconciled. Here are some experiences that the branch servant sends in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Certainly Mr.--- had need of someone to give him</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">some hope. He was born deaf and dumb and had never' learned to read nor write. Knowing this, Jehovah’s witnesses living in his Andes mountain village had been bypassing his house each time they covered that territory. After all, what could be done to help him? But the circuit servant’s wife did not think that way about it when she inquired of the sister with whom she was working as to why she walked by that particular house without stopping. The two of them retraced their steps to the house, and the circuit servant’s wife, instead of knocking on the door, gave the wooden door handle a vigorous shaking. They waited. She waggled it again. The door was opened by a pleasantappearing, middle-aged man. The sister nodded to him and smiled, which served as her introduction, and then she immediately took out of her book bag the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font9"> Using her own style of sign language, she began to give a sermon with the pictures. Touching only the high points leading up to the destruction of the old system, she pointed out the new order that was to follow. She could see by the facial expressions of the man that he was getting the idea. To close off her presentation she took out of her own pocketbook the money equivalent of the book and pointed from the one to the other. The man disappeared inside and in a matter of seconds returned with just that amount. The happiness and contentment apparent on the man’s face made the whole effort worthwhile in the eyes of the Witnesses, and when they were able to gesture indicating they would return, he excitedly nodded his head in affirmation. The good example by the circuit servant’s wife emphasized to the other sister that all doors should be approached in any territory during each coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What Jehovah’s people preach to others they must practice now if they are to produce Christian fruitage among worldly-minded individuals. Self-control and kindness did produce fruitage in this experience. A sister’s children were playing ball in their yard and the ball bounced over an enclosure into the neighbor’s yard. When the children tried to retrieve the ball, the lady of the house angrily told them they could not have it and to stay away from her yard, and if they wanted the ball, their mother would have to come over and ask for it. After a while the sister did go over to knock at the door on behalf of her boys. The same explosive tirade was hurled at her by the lady, who irritatedly wanted to know what youth of today was coming to, going around throwing things onto other people’s property. Instead of replying like for like (which, the sister admitted, in former years would have been her first inclination), the sister agreed that there was much delinquency among the youth of today, but that in the case of her children they were merely getting some healthy exercise playing ball instead of staying in the house all day looking at television. She explained they were really model children who studied the Bible, which book explains why world conditions are so bad today. As the sister witnessed, the lady calmed down and finally invited her into her home. Tactfully it was learned the reason for the woman’s irritation was frustration over the wickedness in the world and not knowing where to turn for comfort. She agreed to a Bible study for the following week, which study has progressed to the point of inquiries about attending congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PHILIPPINE REPUBLIC Population: 32,000,000 Peak Publishers: 36,925 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 867</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Scattered throughout the many islands that make up the Philippine Republic are thousands upon thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses. The brothers there enjoyed many fine experiences during the past year. The high point of the year came when eight district assemblies were held. These proved to be most refreshing and invigorating to the brothers. The largest one was held in San Fernando, La Union, on the west coast of Luzon, where 9,489 heard the public talk. There was a severe water shortage at the assembly, due to a long dry season, but the local fire department came to the aid of the convention and volunteered to supply water for the thirsty conventioners, bringing a fire truck full of water each morning and afternoon for the assembly’s use. On the other hand, Jehovah’s witnesses took the water of life freely to all the people in the community. Here are some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During June and July 140 special pioneers were assigned to work seventy-two towns having a total population of 750,000, and all of them reported fine experiences in these untouched and often isolated areas. Two special pioneers walked for two days over the Sierra Madre mountains to reach the town assigned to them, working isolated houses along the way. No transportation was available and so they were able to carry only a carton of books and 400 magazines plus personal belongings. After working the town for two days they had disposed of all their literature, and they then began offering subscriptions, obtaining thirty in all. One lady came to their accommodations and begged them to study the Bible with her. Before they left the town they held a public meeting, with sixtyseven in attendance. Truly Jehovah’s blessing was manifest on this arrangement to work unassigned territory and many studies were started, to be continued by mail until permanent help can be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A fine demonstration of love and unity among brothers was given in June when much of the downtown area of the town of Batangas was razed by fire. The homes of four Witness families were completely destroyed, including one being used as the Kingdom Hall. Immediately brothers from unaffected areas and nearby congregations came to help, bringing food, clothing and offers of accommodation. Two days after the fire, rebuilding work was in progress, and in a little over a week all four homes had been rebuilt as brother helped brother. In one home the wife was the only one in the truth, and her opposed husband was amazed and impressed when his home was rebuilt by the very ones he had opposed. Because of this loving cooperation Jehovah’s witnesses were the first ones to rebuild their homes. As more contributions came in from other congregations, the brothers resolved that, since they were now resettled and had sufficient for their needs, they would set this money aside to build a Kingdom Hall in which to meet. Truly the brothers proved themselves to be Christ’s disciples!—John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Often people ask us: “What would the world be like if all were Jehovah’s witnesses?” A fine answer to this question can be found in a small, isolated village in Palawan where all the inhabitants are dedicated Witnesses or interested persons. The brothers settled the village about two years ago, and since then have built a road, schoolhouse and Kingdom Hall without any government assistance. Although the village is registered with the municipal authorities, it is the only one that has no elected barrio captain or councilors, and yet it is well organized and more peaceful than other villages. A teacher is assigned to the school from outside, and recently she was offered a transfer to a better position in the central school. However, she refused to move, explaining: “I love my assignment.” When asked why, she said: “It’s not the place, nor the condition, nor the work that I love. It is the people with whom I live. I feel secure living with them, just like living with my own family. There are no drunkards, no gamblers, no criminals, no juvenile delinquents. They all cooperate with me, and the children run errands for me and are respectful and obedient.” When asked for her opinion on the reason these people are so different, she commented: “I think it is their religion. Almost all are Jehovah’s witnesses, and I have never seen a group as well disciplined as this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who take full advantage of Theocratic Ministry School training will be “always ready” to give a coherent witness, to Jehovah’s praise. This was shown during an anniversary program of all public schools in a Luzon town. The day before, local religious leaders had been asked to supply speakers for the occasion, but they declined, being unprepared at such short notice. Finally, on the very day of the celebration, they went to the Kingdom Hall to invite one of Jehovah’s witnesses to speak. A young brother willingly accepted the invitation and, since the program had already begun, he changed his clothes and went with them to the school. Using his notes on the talk “Meeting the Problems of Today’s Youth,” he spoke for forty minutes. When later the guest speaker, the chief school official in the entire province, got up to speak, he complimented the brother and said: “If I gave the speech I had prepared I would only be repeating what this young man said, and I would probably not do as well.” With that he sat down, to the applause of the audience. When the amazed school faculty asked the brother later how he, an “unlettered and ordinary” man, could speak so well before such a distinguished audience, another good witness was given.—1 Pet. 3:15; Acts 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTUGAL, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,470,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,292 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,877</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tests of integrity come upon Jehovah’s witnesses in many ways. Sometimes it is sickness, sometimes opposition by the family or friends or it may be the snare of materialism or even physical persecution by those in authority. Each Christian stands up to his particular test, and how he comes through decides what his future will be. Jehovah’s witnesses in Portugal have withstood the oppression of certain ones within the government who are bent upon doing away with God’s people in that land. The sentencing of some to prison has caused the same reaction among the witnesses of Jehovah in Portugal as the jailing of the apostle Paul did, namely: “Now I desire you to know, brothers, that my affairs have turned out for the advancement of the good news rather than otherwise, so that my prison bonds have become public knowledge in association with Christ . . . and most of the brothers in the Lord, feeling confidence by reason of my prison bonds, are showing all the more courage to speak the word of God fearlessly.”—Phil. 1: 12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses around the world are well acquainted with the zeal that the brothers in Portugal have displayed, and they have seen how such ones have stood up under persecution. Here we have a report from the brothers in Portugal on what is being done in that country itself, as well as in Angola, the Azores, Cape Verde Islands, Madeira and Sao Tome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A common expression says, “A man’s home is his castle,” and there he can be secure. But not in totalitarian lands! Brother A &nbsp;is a model Portuguese citizen who is well liked by all and has never been in difficulties with the police. However, he is also one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and because of his religion he has had to suffer humiliation and indignities at their hands. Flis home has been invaded no less than six times by the police without so much as a search warrant. Each time his house is literally torn apart and his religion belittled, while anything even remotely related to his religion is confiscated. On a number of occasions he has also been called to police headquarters, where he has had to undergo questioning for hours about his religious activity despite the declaration in the Constitution that “no one can question another about his religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The past service year has been an exciting one for Jehovah’s people in Portugal. All the publicity was topped off by the reporting of the trial of the forty-nine accused of “instigating collective disobedience.” Even though the authorities suppressed a detailed account of the happenings after the first day, the news was out and the trial became the center of conversation. You can well imagine the opportunities this afforded for alert ministers! Many conversations were begun with those outside the courthouse who stopped to ask what was going on. Back-calls and studies have been the result. A sister who has an opposing husband, along with hundreds of other Witnesses, made a special effort to be at the courthouse during the trial, but she always made sure that her household duties were not neglected and that she was home in plenty of time to have dinner waiting for her husband when he arrived. Imagine her surprise when, on the third day of the trial, as she stood in the street conversing with other Witnesses, she spied her husband on the other side of the street in with the multitudes who had turned out. She had never mentioned the trial to him for fear he would become angry, but he had read about it and decided to see for himself. Rather than being angry, he sided with the Witnesses for their stand for liberty and has since shown a more friendly attitude toward the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While witnessing from door to door, two sisters were ushered into the sitting room of a large home where they had a long conversation with the owner, a retired judge, and his wife. This couple were amazed that Jehovah’s witnesses would still preach from door to door in Portugal, with the police so active against them. It was explained that true followers of Christ are obligated to preach and would continue to do so just as the apostles did, according to Acts the fifth chapter. The judge’s final comments were that there are many influential people in the Portuguese government who are in our favor and that his home would always be open to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Wine is an important product in Portugal and is the means of livelihood for many people. It also was the means by which at least one family started on the road to everlasting life. The husband owns a small store where wine is sold in bulk from large barrels. It is necessary now and then to purchase the wine from the wholesaler, and on one of these trips he met another store owner who had also come to buy a barrel of wine. As usual, the conversation turned to the difficulties in earning a living, and the shopkeeper mentioned to the other that a few gallons of water in with the wine helped him to meet expenses. This was an opening for the other man, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who mentioned he could not do such a thing, and then he gave a short sermon on how true Christians must be honest in all things. This amazed the other and he readily accepted an offer of a visit at a more appropriate time to discuss the matter. A back-call was made, a study started and today the shop owner and his family are all dedicated Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The border police stopped one busload of brothers going to the assembly and, because of orders from the Lisbon police, refused to let them pass. After some arguing the authorities agreed to let the bus go through, except for five brothers who would have to stay behind. Nothing could be done to change their minds, so our five brothers stood in the lonely frontier town and watched with heavy hearts as the bus pulled away. What would they do now? A little meeting was held, and after prayer and discussion they agreed to spend the day witnessing in the village, which had never before heard the Kingdom message. So the whole town received a witness, and what little literature they had was placed with those showing interest. Rather than show a defeatist’s attitude due to the blow struck at them by the adversary, these five brothers came away victorious, rejoicing in a fine day of theocratic activity in isolated territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ANGOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,605,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Contact with our brothers in Angola during the year has been very limited due to the strict surveillance of the government. Many have been arrested and warned to abandon their study of the Bible. The police have used all methods possible to search out those who desire to serve the true God so as to stop the spread of the Kingdom message. Several of our brothers have fallen victim to the following ruse. At one of the busier bus stops a man stands reading one of our publications. Since Jehovah’s witnesses are always ready to take advantage of any opportunity to preach, and especially in countries where door-to-door work is so very dangerous, it is only natural that when a Witness comes upon this scene he starts a conversation. The stranger pretends to be a Witness from another town or an interested person and begins to make inquiries of the Witness. When he is convinced that he is talking with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he identifies himself as a policeman and marches our brother off to jail. The literature he uses for his trap is that which is sent to our brothers and illegally taken from the mails by the authorities. While the Witness is held in jail, his home is searched and all religious articles as well as others are confiscated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AZORES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;348,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The leading newspaper of the Azores Islands recently published an article on the front page entitled “The Christian Disinterest in the Defense of the Church,” in which it lamented the condition of the Catholic church and then went on to say: “The Church in the Azores is persecuted by sects that teach error against the Religion, against the Family and against the Fatherland. . . . The carriers of this discord go from door to door as Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Babylon the Great sees its walls tumbling down around it and viciously lashes out against a handful of Witnesses who offer refuge to lovers of the Bible. In its attack it uses everything within reach, including the hand of the State. The police have been goaded to take action against the Witnesses, and interested persons have been warned not to study with us. This has caused </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> weeding out of those less interested as well as a firmer stand by those who are really God’s “sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brother B---- was given notice to appear before</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the local police and was detained for several hours. During this time the local director of police gave a tyrannical discourse about Jehovah’s witnesses and stated that Brother B &nbsp;could never again speak about the Bible. His reply was that he would cease to speak of the Bible only when dead. No sooner had these words been spoken than he was struck a stunning blow across the face. He was then scornfully pushed into another room to recover from the blow. Later, he was called again for questioning and, after being warned to stop his preaching, was released. This is just one of many acts committed against Jehovah’s witnesses on the islands during the year, but the brothers have not become discouraged but remember Jesus’ words: “By endurance on your part you will acquire your souls.”—Luke 21:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CAPE VERDE ISLANDS Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Due to the unfriendly relations between Portugal and most of the African countries, the Cape Verde Islands are very isolated from the African mainland and the rest of the world. Despite their isolation, the two publishers on these islands continue to preach the good news of God’s kingdom and have gathered together a group of thirteen interested persons who desire to align themselves on Jehovah’s side of the great issue. They have reported that there are many more who show interest but are afraid due to pressures brought about by the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year a brother from the United States made a visit to the islands, and although he was unable to have much contact with the publishers due to the distances between the islands, he was able to leave a good supply of literature and stimulate the work. What a blessing it would be if more could make arrangements to visit our brothers in faraway places and encourage them to continue in good works! We are hoping that someone from the Portuguese mainland will be able to pay a visit to the Cape Verde Islands shortly and help in organizing the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MADEIRA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The authorities continue to harass the brothers, and literature is received with difficulty, but the Kingdom message continues to be spread. One day as one of Jehovah’s witnesses engaged in the door-to-door work, someone called the police to have him arrested. He was taken down to headquarters and questioned about his work. When it was explained to the chief that our work is purely Biblical and has nothing to do with politics, the chief was dubious, as he had information to the contrary. How could the matter be settled? It was decided that one of the police would accompany the brother, and they would return to the houses where he had been witnessing. So off went the brother with the policeman by his side. At each door it was explained what had taken place at the first visit, and there was also time to give a further witness. Many of those who had not listened the first time were surprised to see the policeman and now listened intently to the sermon. After a time the policeman said it would not be necessary to go to any more of the houses, but the brother insisted that they go back to every home that had been visited before. The policeman agreed, but, since it was lunch time, made arrangements to meet the brother after having something to eat. They met at the appointed time and the door-to-door work continued. Once during the day the policeman complained of being tired and suggested they take a bus to the next home. But the brother replied that we are not paid for this work and cannot waste our money on public transport. At the end of the day the policeman gave a favorable report to his superiors, and the brother has not been bothered since. It is interesting to note that the policeman was favorably impressed by the work and asked for some of our literature, and arrangements were made for a back-call.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">When fighting broke out in the territory of Angola in 1961, Portugal sent many native Africans off to exile on the island of Sao Tome, where they worked on the coffee plantations as virtual prisoners. Among these Africans were several witnesses of Jehovah who were falsely accused of acts against the government. Their mail was heavily censored and it was very difficult to supply them with even a Bible, but Jehovah lovingly saw to it that his “sheep” were cared for. Through the years since 1961 our brothers were able to gather together a small group of interested persons and to share the literature they had. This resulted in a number taking their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the years passed, the government began to send back to the African mainland many of those held on the island. Among them were some who had heard the Kingdom message from our faithful few brothers. Finally, it became our brothers’ turn to leave, and so over the past two years all of those who started the work in Sao Tome have left, leaving behind only a few interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Although all alone and hindered by lack of knowledge of the Portuguese language, one interested person manages to keep in contact with the Society by going to the local post office where he hires a professional letter writer to do his correspondence. He manages to send his report and at the same time say a few words about the truth, which acts as a witness to the one writing the letter for him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 3,594 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 735</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The island of Puerto Rico has certainly come into prominence in the last several years. People in the island have become prosperous and they are gaining much as far as material wealth is concerned. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, are not being overpowered by these material things in the island, but they are diligent in storing up treasures in heaven as they help the people to learn the good news of the Kingdom. This requires preaching. Due to their very fine activity during the past year there was a 10-percent increase in publishers in the island. Eight new congregations were formed, and the branch servant reports that the Kingdom Halls are usually packed out to overflowing on Sunday afternoons. <a name="bookmark171"></a><a name="bookmark172"></a>The branch office, located in Santurce, makes a report on Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands (U.S.) and Tortola (British Virgin Islands).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One pioneer took to heart the Society’s counsel to visit the husbands of the publishers to see if they could be interested in the truth. As a result, seven husbands were visited during the year and now five of these are studying the Bible, three regularly attend meetings and one participates in the field service. Another congregation following this example also made arrangements to visit some of the husbands of the sisters, and now four home Bible studies have been started in that congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The special pioneers working in small towns are finding many persons who are thirsting for the waters of truth. A brother sent in this experience: “I was working from house to house and found a lady who showed much interest in the Kingdom message. She invited me to return, which I did, but since it was a Saturday and she was going out with her family, we could talk for only about ten minutes. I called back two weeks later but was informed by her mother that her daughter was in the hospital. I decided to visit her, but after leaving the house I remembered that there were two hospitals and I did not know which one she was in. However, the next day as I passed by one of the hospitals I heard a voice calling me and saw the son of the interested lady waving to me. He asked me if I was going to visit his mother and so, of course, I went right in to speak to her. The first thing she said was: ‘I cannot agree with people who will let their children die because of not giving transfusions of blood.’ I could not explain much right then, so promised to come back later in the day, which I did, and we discussed many scriptures on the use of blood. When we had finished she said: 'Even if I have to die, I will not violate God’s law by taking a blood transfusion.’ Then she asked: ‘How can I become one of Jehovah’s witnesses?’ When I explained that she should study the Bible first, she agreed to a study in her home. Now the whole family is studying and attending meetings in the Kingdom Hall. Since they have many visitors, they find that this hinders their attending meetings, so now they leave home sometimes two hours before the meeting and go to a nearby brother’s house and from there go to the Kingdom Hall, and in this way when the visitors call they have already left for the meeting. The son has already participated in the field service, and the whole family are a great stimulus to our tiny congregation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TORTOLA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8,619</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 17 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 507</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many people use the local public library and, seeing that this could be a means of spreading the truth, a brother approached the friendly librarian and said he would like to make a contribution of books to the library. Upon acceptance of the offer the brother made up a package of theocratic publications including the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font9"> and six other translations of the Bible. Two brothers delivered the books and highlighted the purpose and value of each and showed how they could be used in Bible study. The librarian showed great appreciation, especially for the booklet on evolution. A short while later the following letter was received: ‘‘Dear Sirs: I am writing to thank you in behalf of the Library Service Committee for the generous contributions, which you recently made to this Library, and to assure you that your contribution is greatly appreciated.” It is hoped that by this means some of those who use the library might come to a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Upon receiving the outlines for the first twenty public talks for the 1966 series, the congregation servant was delighted with the fine information presented and was desirous of helping all the brothers in the congregation to receive this spiritual food. But how could he find speakers for so many talks, when the nearest congregation was many miles away across the sea? There was only one way, and that was to give most of the talks himself. So he set himself the task of preparing nearly all the twenty discourses, giving one every other week. In this way the brothers are kept spiritually strong and the attendance at the talks and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study is now over 100 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">VIRGIN ISLANDS (U.S.) Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 155 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 265</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Patience and endurance are necessary to help people learn the truth. A publisher writes: “I often felt discouraged because a lady with whom I was studying just did not progress. She had four small children and opposition in the family, and it seemed that she forgot from week to week the things learned. So, many weeks were spent going over the same truths. This made the lady herself want to quit the study, and I found myself encouraging her with scriptures to continue. Then after three years the husband forbade me to enter the house. The study was continued just </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">outside</span><span class="font9"> the house until the husband relented and let me come inside again. Soon the woman was attending meetings and going in the service. Then her husband joined in the study and attended the circuit assembly, where his wife was baptized. He continues to study, attends meetings and goes out in the field service.” So patience, one of the fruits of the spirit, brings with it great rewards and blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many people say they are too busy to listen, but the following experience shows that a tactful reply and looking for something to interest the person can often gain a hearing ear. A publisher in the house-to-house work was told by a middle-aged lady that she was too busy to listen. The sister briefly explained that our work was to help people learn of God’s Word and, even though she was busy, it would be good to listen to the short message because it would be a great help to her and her children. To this the lady wistfully replied: “I have never had a child in my life, not one.” “But there is still a chance to have some,” replied the publisher. The lady said she could not see how this was possible, but now listened with great interest to the various scriptures on life in God’s new order as they were read. She said that she had had very little education and so it would be difficult for her to study the Bible, but upon being assured that that was not important, she readily agreed to a return visit for a Bible study. The publisher found it difficult to leave the house, for this “busy” person wanted to keep on talking about the Bible, and even after half an hour was still talking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">RHODESIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,325,100</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The country of Rhodesia is in the news constantly as far as the political world is concerned, but Jehovah’s witnesses are not involving themselves in the politics of the country. Their principal work, and only work, is to preach the good news of God’s kingdom, which shows the people of the land what the only hope for mankind is. Jehovah’s witnesses have been happy in praising the true God during the past year and have done good work in comforting many. The unsettled conditions in the country have disturbed many persons who claim to be dedicated to God, but we sincerely hope that those who are still standing for God’s kingdom will stay close to his organization and not forsake the house of their God, worshiping regularly together so that they can be steadfast to the end. Here are some experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An experience from a special pioneer illustrates the reward that comes from putting complete trust in Jehovah when one’s right to preach is questioned. Under present emergency regulations the police are suspicious of anyone who they think may not be properly employed. The special pioneer had been assigned to a mining area; and shortly after taking up residence, with the permission of the mine authorities, he was visited by the police and questioned. The police went to the owner of the mine to say that they did not want him there and that he must go. The owner sent for the special pioneer, saying he was sorry about the matter but that there was nothing he could do. The special pioneer writes: “I asked him if he would first let me go to the police and see what I could do. When he agreed, I went home and prayed to Jehovah.” Then he prepared his briefcase and went to the police station, saying to the sergeant in charge: “I am a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses and I have heard that you do not want me to stay here. Why? What have I done?” So the sergeant took the special pioneer to the officer in charge, who heard the matter and then said: “Why do you bring this man here? He is a minister, not a political agitator. Jehovah’s witnesses are good people and do not cause trouble. Go and tell the owner of the mine that he may stay.” The special pioneer then requested permission to speak to the policemen at the station, and, when this was granted, he succeeded in placing five magazines, starting with the policeman who had originally visited him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Families present no insurmountable problems to those who love Jehovah, who organise themselves and work together so that some may pioneer. An African sister who has been a regular pioneer for eleven years writes: “I am telling you that I cannot stop going ahead in praising Jehovah. Our children are a blessing from Him. My husband, our children and I are happily working together in Jehovah’s service, and we cooperate to get the housework done. I have nine children and four are dedicated. Oh, what joy we have in our family!” A special pioneer reports that his wife, who is also a special pioneer, gave birth to twins! They wondered how they were going to stay in the special pioneer ministry with their new responsibility. Finally, they settled for two cardboard boxes fixed to the rear wheel of their bicycles with blankets laid inside. He says: “The people were very surprised at our faith in Jehovah. They said it is impossible to ignore these Jehovah’s witnesses as they call on us.” As the babies grew bigger, wooden boxes were made, and now, as they continue as special pioneers, he says: “We can go wherever we want to without any hindrance and this has become a part of the witness in our territory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Visiting those who are physically sick is a fine way to show Christian love and can be as rewarding as visiting the spiritually sick. A sister from an outlying area came to Salisbury for an operation. Publishers were advised of her coming and, although she was not well known personally in the city, she tells us: “I used to look forward keenly to visiting hours, wondering who would come in; and I was never disappointed, as in all my three weeks’ stay in the hospital not one day passed without two or sometimes even six of the brothers and sisters coming along to cheer me up and brighten my day. Others in the ward would say: ‘My word, you’re popular. You </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">do</span><span class="font9"> get a lot of visitors.’ I would then explain who you were and would have opportunity to speak about our Kingdom hope.” She concludes by saying that these brief visits in the hospital did much to open the minds of other patients who formerly had refused to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL Population: 3,400,000 Peak Publishers: 98 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 34,700</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The service year started in Senegal with the opening of a branch office. This was established in the modern capital city of Dakar. Jehovah’s witnesses in Senegal diligently and quietly pursue their beneficial free Bible educational work, and they have made outstanding progress during the past twelve months. While there are not very many publishers of the Kingdom in this part of Africa, still the Society is doing everything possible to keep Witnesses in this part of the earth. Right now there are two congregations in Senegal, and the office in Dakar looks after the work in Gambia, Mali and Mauritania too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Bible study was started with a young Catholic lady who, upon being visited by the bishop, confided to him that she was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. To her surprise the bishop approved the study and commended her desire to learn the teachings of the Bible. He added: “I will have to survey your spiritual development.” Week after week the bishop would examine the material in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Good News’<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font9"> booklet in order to find the “errors.” When he finally came to the paragraphs on the “Kingdom of the Heavens” and read that this will be limited to 144,000 faithful ones, he thought he had found the “error” and started voicing his objections. The young lady asked the bishop to prove his points from the Bible and insisted on knowing why he thought it was impossible to have only 144,000 members in the kingdom of the heavens. The bishop was confused and finally stated: “It is possible. I have to admit that I have never deeply examined this point.” This, of course, greatly encouraged the sincere lady to continue her studies with more interest and determination than ever before, in spite of the verbal abuse by some of her prominent relatives. The spirit of tolerance and respect for the opinion of the others produced its fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Catholic woman chose to join the Protestants because they were more inclined to Bible reading. Soon she was discouraged again because, although reading the Bible, the Protestants made no real effort to help people to understand the Bible. Many years passed, and then one day her husband, who is Moslem, came home with three booklets that he had obtained from one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He mocked the statement that Jesus is the Son of God, saying that God does not have a wife. However, the wife read the booklets and eagerly responded, writing to the Society for further help to understand the Bible. Soon a Bible study started with a representative of the Society. Later the study stopped, since the husband objected strongly and threatened to take the child and put his wife out of the house. Five years later a new contact was made with Jehovah’s witnesses. The study was restarted, and again the husband objected, becoming very indignant, to the point of sending his daughter, now seventeen, to his native country, Lebanon, in order to learn and practice the Moslem religion. However, the daughter, upon returning, told her mother that her stay in Lebanon convinced her that Jehovah’s witnesses are the ones teaching the truth. The mother replied that she felt the same way. So they decided to make their feelings known to the father, only to get his definite decision that he would never let them become Jehovah’s witnesses. When they insisted, he put both of them out of the house. Although they have had to overcome many difficulties since then, their zeal for the truth is greater than ever before; they started to attend meetings and zealously publish the Word of truth to others. They await the coming assembly to symbolize their dedication by water immersion. Shameful treatment, abuse and all kinds of devilish persecution cannot discourage sincere people from doing Jehovah’s will when convinced that they have found the truth and are doing the right thing!—1 Pet. 2:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;316,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 39,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The small congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses at Bathurst, the capital of Gambia, continues to keep its “lampstand” firmly in its place, shining the light of truth for all those willing to be benefited by the illuminating force of the Word of God, the Bible. There were no spectacular increases during the service year, but the brothers were very busy and a good volume of work was accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After attending some meetings of the congregation, sincere people are impressed to see the great difference in the Instructive meetings of God’s people and start wondering why the meetings of Babylonish religion are so dull and lacking in enthusiasm. This is the main reason why an average of ten now attend the meetings regularly, which means more attendees than publishers. Two of these sincere people who swelled the attendance recently were contacted in the magazine work in 1960. In spite of the effort made to study with them, they would not respond at that time. However, they were not overlooked and every opportunity was used to talk to them and to invite them to the meetings. Even though these efforts were without results for some years, the ceaseless effort, good patience and perseverance produced happifying results, and both of them now attend regularly and are happy about the good things they learn during these instructive meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MALI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 4,200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 600,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the very beginning of the service year, September 1965, the four missionaries were notified by the local police authorities that they would not be permitted to preach to the local people and had to leave the country. Of course, the departure of these four mature ministers affected the work in this difficult country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young man of Moslem origin was contacted during the house-to-house ministry, and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book was placed with him. On the first back-call a study was started, and, since the young man had no religious knowledge, we had to be very patient, but slowly progress was made. A Bible was provided for him, and it was encouraging to observe how he learned to look for the desired scriptures by himself. At the end of every study it was necessary to explain Satan’s opposition to God’s people, to prepare him to face eventual persecution and difficulties. It was observed with satisfaction that all this did not dampen his desire to learn the truth, and he made slow but firm progress. Later, he was invited to our meetings, and he faithfully attended them all. He was soon enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School, and the brothers were rejoicing at his progress. When difficulties came and the missionaries had to leave the country, it was feared that he might be influenced somehow, but this was not the case. Instead he continued to progress to the point of publishing a few months after the leaving of the missionaries, and he continues his good progress month after month, to Jehovah’s glory and to the joy and happiness of the ones helping him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MAURITANIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is the first time that we have ever received any reports from this country. There were two congregation publishers that devoted 132 hours to the field service, placed some literature and got a study started during the year. This is a desert country and conditions are unfavorable for any organized work. However, we will see what the future brings as far as any further witnessing in the land is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SIERRA LEONE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,180,623</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 572 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 3,812</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God’s spirit continues to work upon the brothers in Sierra Leone in their untiring efforts as they move forward preaching the wholesome message of God’s Word. It has been a good year for the publishers, and they had fine results in their field activity. They enjoyed a 14-percent increase. As the service year ended, the branch office there was making arrangements for the building of a new missionary home, Kingdom Hall and branch office combined; they were just about ready to break ground for the construction of this new building. The brothers there express their appreciation for the generosity on the part of their brothers in other countries of the world so as to make such a thing possible in Sierra Leone. Here are some reports from the branch servant in Sierra Leone. They also cover Guinea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was really refreshing to read the simple letters from these humble truth-loving brothers, some in the Kissi tongue and others in English, as they impressively told the Society: “See, I have learned to read and write this year!” They just wanted the branch office to know how appreciative they were for the assistance given them in learning to read and write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These warmhearted brothers have made favorable impressions on officials and chiefs in other ways too, the most important of which is their Christian conduct. For example, because of smuggling, the customs officials at a border post between Sierra Leone and another country have been very rigid in their inspection of trucks. It has become well known by the officials that Jehovah’s witnesses are very honest and faithful in matters of this kind. However, one truck driver tried to use this honesty of Jehovah’s witnesses to his own advantage when going through customs. There were only three brothers among the many passengers on the truck, but when they arrived at customs the truck driver declared that all his passengers were Jehovah’s witnesses. On hearing this, one of the brothers quietly mentioned to the customs’ officer that there were only three brothers in the truck. The officer ordered an inspection of the vehicle and found some contraband goods carried by some of those who were not Jehovah’s witnesses. The disclosing of the truth established even to a greater degree the honesty and integrity of the brothers and added more salt to their Christian conduct before all in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We should not underestimate the power of the truth as expressed by our children. When children are trained to give ready answers, much good can be accomplished. In one school the teacher asked a young Witness to give five points or facts in respect to what Jehovah’s witnesses believed about the trinity, immortality of the soul, hellfire, and so forth, and why we claim to be the only true religion. The young sister was given a few days to prepare the material. On the day arranged, three hours were set aside for</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">argumentation and Scriptural explanations. What was the evidence that the teachers of the school were satisfied with the answers? Five of them subscribed for the magazines, with arrangements being made for further discussions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fine examples of the aged are also encouraging. One brother started pioneering when he was seventy-two years of age, and, although he is now past eighty-six years of age, he is still enjoying the blessings and joys of the pioneer service. He has set a wonderful example for many younger ones by walking twice a week to the Kingdom Hall without fail, in all kinds of weather, up and down a steep mountain, over a distance of more than five miles one way, to attend the congregation meetings. He regularly takes part in the ministry school, handles his service meeting parts efficiently and, up to this year, has been playing the organ for singing the Kingdom songs. What a source of strength to us all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">GUINEA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,500,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 76 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 32,895</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Conditions have not been easy for the brothers in Guinea during the year. The four missionaries that arrived in the early spring were not allowed to remain in Guinea. This was disappointing to the local brothers, but they have continued to preach the “good news” without letup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At certain times of the year, during the farming season the villages in some sections of the country are deserted during the daytime. Particularly at the time of preparing the ground and planting and during the harvesttime, when the birds are ever ready to consume the rice crop, whole families live in the fields. This problem has been overcome by the brothers’ working in twos and going directly to the workers in the fields. The workers are so busy that there is little time for them to listen to the truth, but by one brother assisting with the weeding, time is made for the family head to relax and listen to the sermon given by the other brother. The publishers take turns at this, and a large number of sermons are given even during the busiest time of the farming season. Thus the waters of truth can flow in all seasons to these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Other brothers have found success in traveling to the villages in the evenings, giving lectures, conducting Bible studies, staying overnight in the village and traveling on to the next one the next day. Sometimes they study, lecture and answer questions, with most of the villagers present, for three-quarters of the night. By the time of the brothers’ leaving in the morning, although the villagers have not had much sleep, they feel spiritually refreshed, encouraged and strengthened, and much happier than before the brothers arrived. During one conversation, one of the seekers of good heart said: “Mmmm, so you mean Jehovah has an organization that cares that much for me?” Needless to say, a Bible study was started with this person. He expressed his appreciation by escorting the brother for as much as five miles, even passing through other villages and witnessing along the way. Even as those interested in the preaching of Jesus followed him along the way, so it is with many of these interested persons. But the villagers soon realize they must return home to scare away the birds and care for their family responsibilities. The brothers will soon call again for more home Bible studies, more lectures and more answering of questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGAPORE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 1,865,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">For one year, now, Singapore has been operating as an independent state separate and distinct from Malaysia. Malaysia still has the territory that is now called West Malaysia, East Malaysia and Brunei. In all the territory under the jurisdiction of the Branch in Singapore there has been an increase, and the brothers have pushed ahead zealously declaring the good news of God’s kingdom. There is much work to be done in this vast territory. The need is very great in that part of the world, but the problem is to get missionaries into these countries in order to advance the work of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. However, those who are there are putting in good hours, conducting many Bible studies, and they are having good success. Here are some experiences sent in by the Singapore branch office on Singapore and Malaysia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A man not in the truth, commenting on the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly, said: “What impressed me most was the high standard of material and delivery that came from the platform during the whole of the assembly.” And what appropriate counsel we received! We certainly appreciated the timely instruction. Two weeks after the assembly our schoolchildren were faced with an issue arising from the newly instituted flag-saluting ceremony. With ‘Be like Jeremiah’ and ‘Listen to Daniel’s Words’ ringing in their ears, they were able to take the opportunity to give in a respectful manner a fine witness in favor of true worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The importance of coming into Jehovah’s organization is shown by this experience. A sister writes: “In 1963 I came in contact with a lady and her daughter who were associated with a group of people known as ‘Jehovah the True God Church.’ This group was a breakaway from another mission called ‘The True Jesus Mission,’ which originated from the mainland of China. They had disagreed on the matter of the trinity and, noting the name Jehovah in the Chinese Bible, they decided to take the above name for their church. The 1963 assembly impressed this family and they could see that Jehovah has a large organization operating world wide. They must be directed to this organization. I started a study with them, and since the first study the daughter has been a regular meeting attender and early saw her need to break connections with Babylon the Great. Six months ago she symbolized her dedication to Jehovah the true God. Her mother too has been making progress to the point of ceasing to go along with the previous group but spends her time associating with Jehovah’s witnesses. She is instructing her three young children and encouraging them in meeting attendance. Her aging mother has requested that she too be taught about the true God and his organization, and a study is being conducted with her in Chinese. A young man who is a friend of the family has also been encouraged by their enthusiasm, is studying and is attending meetings regularly, even giving his first student talk in the Theocratic Ministry School recently. Their depth of devotion is shown by their desire to grow in knowledge, regularly reading the text for the day from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font9">before departing for work or school. This is followed by Bible reading and prayer. Their honest desire to serve the true God is being rewarded, and Jehovah is blessing them. They have found security in his organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In offering our services to conduct free home Bible studies as suggested in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font9"> we should not think that some persons are not capable of studying. A call was made on a servant girl, and, contrary to general opinion, this girl accepted the offer to be aided to study the Bible. Before the study could be held regularly, permission was asked of the lady of the house, and she willingly consented. The study got under way, part in English and part in Chinese. The student quickly saw the need of attending at the Kingdom Hall, but at the same time the lady of the house displayed some Pharaoh-like qualities and said she could not have time off to go. By now the student had enough knowledge to decide what to do, so she tendered her resignation. The lady did not want her to go, because she was a good worker; so arrangements were made whereby the servant could go to the Kingdom Hall, and she continues to make good progress in learning to be a servant of the Most High God and his Son Jesus Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“I restarted a study with a couple,” writes a pioneer, &quot;and the wife would tell me that she was worried because her husband did not seem to be really interested. I assured her that time and patience would tell, and that it was necessary for both to continue the study together. One day after the study the wife was telling me about a frightening experience she had when a violent storm broke near the house. The thunder rattled the house, the lightning flashed so close and the wind tore down the fence. ‘Believe me, I was terribly weakened,’ she said. ‘I am sure Armageddon must be terrifying.’ I encouraged her by saying that we will have Jehovah’s protection during that time. At this point her husband took out a magazine I had left him to read and turned to the article ‘It Rained in Rio’ and read the portion where Jehovah’s people were unharmed and the Kingdom Halls were intact. He said: ‘See, Jehovah protected his people. There is nothing to be afraid of, only have faith.’ This husband has been quietly taking in knowledge from the study and now is preparing to adjust himself to theocratic standards. I am determined to invite and aid such husbands, although seemingly uninterested, to share in the family Bible study wherever possible, and to allow the truth to do the transforming work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A congregation publisher who is a hospital assistant in a small town found that his job kept him so busy that there was no time left for anything else. On coming into the truth three years ago he put forth a determined effort to get time off for attendance at meetings along with his family. However, not too long after he had made this adjustment he was transferred to a small town twenty-four miles away, where he was faced with the problem of isolation. He realised that he would go backward if he did not do something about it. If only he had a Bible study to conduct; but then he was not very skilled in this part of the service. However, he knew he must begin, so after asking Jehovah’s guidance he went from door to door. He began a home Bible study right away. He felt happy and encouraged. Shortly after that he began another study. He was elated. Since then he has increased his home Bible studies to four. A pioneer came to visit him and four more studies were started. Then his wife came and she started two more studies. So in this small town there are ten Bible studies in progress, and the brother is thankful to Jehovah for the blessings on his efforts to keep Kingdom interests first, especially when things appeared to be at their worst.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Faithful activity in any feature of Jehovah’s service with the right motive always results in a blessing, and this has been true for many of our brothers in South Africa who engaged in the vacation pioneer work. Jehovah’s witnesses in South Africa were delighted that 1,364 took part in the vacation pioneer service during the month of April, and these along with the regular and special pioneers brought the full-time publishers in that land for the one month up to 2,336, which was more than 11 percent of the 20,407 publishers reporting that month. The motive of all of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world is to bring honor and glory to Jehovah’s name, and when they engage faithfully in that service they receive a rich blessing. Here are some experiences from South Africa, Ascension, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, St. Helena, SouthWest Africa and Swaziland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is certainly true that getting newly interested ones to associate with the organization is a key step in helping them to progress toward dedication and sharing in the Christian ministry. A brother and his wife had much joy in studying with a married couple living on a farm, even though it involved a round trip of fifty-two miles each time. But after studying for about a year their joy began to ebb as the couple did not seem to be making any further progress. The circuit servant advised that an even greater effort be made to get the interested couple to a meeting. Though in the past the publishers had invited them to meetings, the brother now gave extra preparation to presenting material at the study about the value of meeting attendance. After two or three of these specially prepared discussions, the brother and his wife were delighted to see the interested couple arrive for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study. This couple had held responsible positions in the local Methodist Church and this apparently was what had been holding them back. But, now, as the brother wrote: “One </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study helped them to decide for good.” From that time on they hardly missed a meeting. They have resigned from their responsibilities in their former religion and are now sharing in preaching the good news from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a world where teen-agers so often take the easy “way of the crowd,” it is certainly refreshing in the New World society to have teen-agers who have the determination to stand up for the truth, come what may. Some have even made the step out of the old world into the Christian ministry at a young age and in the face of much family opposition. One young coloured girl, aged thirteen, had to take up work as a domestic servant. She later wrote to the Society: “My employer turned out to be a wonderful person and told me many good things from the Bible. She invited me to join in a study of the Bible, which they held regularly in their home. What I learned moved me to speak of my new-found joy to one of my friends. The following day when I went home, my mother gave me the beating of my life, without asking any questions. Only afterward she asked whether I was going to stick to the church with the big cross. My answer was ‘No!’ Immediately my mother took me away from this employer and sent me 150 miles away to live with an aunt I had never met before. How scared I was on coming to this big city for the first time! But imagine my joy when, on the very second day after my arriving, my aunt invited me to a meeting, a meeting conducted in exactly the same way as that held in the home of my former employer. It turned out to be a congregation book study. Nothing could block my way now. Soon I was sharing in the house-to-house work, and I now have the joy of conducting two home Bible studies, and these people are progressing well. I am looking forward to being baptized at our coming district assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A young child’s interest in the truth and his willingness to follow Bible teachings can powerfully influence older persons. That is one good reason for inviting younger members of the household to join in a home Bible study. A sister was conducting a study with an elderly African lady, but no progress was being made. The young twelve-year-old grandson was invited to join in the study. A few weeks later a relative paid a visit to the home. According to custom, a goat was slaughtered (this while the grandmother was absent), and the visitor gave some of the blood to the young boy to cook and eat. He was amazed when the boy refused to do so. Asked why, the boy fetched a Bible and read from Leviticus 17:10-14. When the grandmother returned and the visitor related what had happened, she was very pleased and took out a subscription for the boy and also made arrangements for him to attend the coming district assembly. But the experience also stimulated her own interest, and now the grandmother is making good progress in her studies and looking forward to attending the assembly herself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Ascension is a British island in the South Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is small and has only thirty-four square miles of territory, but a publisher spent three months there, devoted seventy-three hours to the field service and had three Bible studies going. So we will watch developments as time passes. No matter where people are in the earth, if one of Jehovah’s witnesses can get to them they will get a witness about God’s kingdom and a seed of truth may be planted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BASUTOLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;800,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The work in this country, which became newly independent in October 1966, has continued to move forward, and the past service year saw the greatest witness yet given to the people of this land. The territory is mostly very mountainous, making many of the villages difficult to reach except on foot or on horseback. Yet the publishers in Basutoland are determined to get the good news preached to all the people there as far as they possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Two African pioneers walked some forty miles to reach one mountain village, and then stayed there a week, placing sixty magazines, thirty-six booklets and five bound books. The interest of the villagers aroused the anger of one of the local “false shepherds.” He undertook to prove that it was Jehovah’s witnesses who were false. Calling a meeting of his church members, he invited the two pioneers also to attend, and then asked them to state just what their purpose was in coming to the village. The brothers gladly seized this opportunity and gave a fine witness to the forty-three present. After they had spoken for about forty-five minutes, the clergyman tried to discredit what they had said, but found his own people disagreeing with him. When they started asking him questions, demanding Bible answers, he soon left. The pioneers started six studies with these people and regularly walk the forty miles once or twice a month to feed the truth-hungry &quot;sheep.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bible truth really does “set free,” and this is no more evident than in the way the truth frees persons bound by pagan superstitions. In 1961 a man took his stand for pure worship. His wife became bitterly opposed. She and the rest of the family seemed to work together to try to break down his integrity, his wife even refusing to cook for him or wash his clothes, so that the brother had to care for his own needs in this way. When his father died, the brother as the eldest son became the head of the family. His wife and other relatives tried to pressure him into upholding family customs and traditions such as slaughtering an animal in honour of the dead ancestors. His refusal increased their opposition. Through five years of continued opposition the brother stuck by Bible principles while manifesting patience and kindness to all in the family. Eventually the wife became so impressed by his conduct that she began to realize that her husband must indeed have something good. She began to study. After attending two assemblies, where she got to see how and why Jehovah’s people are so different, she started out in the ministry herself and is now helping others to become free from pagan superstitious customs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Bechuanaland has been subjected to drought conditions for a number of years, and this has brought much poverty and has undoubtedly affected the activity of the publishers. In one area water was so scarce that, when a number of educated young African men wanted to be baptized at a circuit assembly, they walked seven miles to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> pool in the river, only to find it dry. The next morning the district servant had to drive them in his car twenty miles to a water hole, but it too had dried up. Another five miles brought them to a muddy pool where cattle were drinking, but this did not daunt these young men, and there they were baptized in symbol of their dedication to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A special pioneer was finding some opposition to his preaching from a paramount chief. The district servant decided to visit the chief and see what could be done to overcome the difficulties. At first the chief did not manifest much interest, but when the district servant showed him the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book in Tswana and also the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial”</span><span class="font9"> he was amazed at the information contained in them and that they were left with people on such a small contribution. Then he opened the drawer of his desk and took out three magazines, copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font9"> and asked: “Do you know who prints these?” On learning that it was the same organization, his whole attitude improved. He said: &quot;If you print these magazines you may by all means do your work around here, for I find these magazines very useful for reference. That is why I keep these copies here at my desk.” The chief then allowed us to show the “Everlasting Good News” film right in his kraal, and even sent out some of his headmen to inform the village of the showing. That evening nearly a thousand were in attendance. This certainly shows the powerful part magazines play in making known the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The Society’s film “Proclaiming ‘Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” played an outstanding part in the witness given during the past year on the island of St. Helena. During the visit of the circuit servant from South Africa, 814 people saw this film. Unusual rain did not dampen the zeal of the brothers to show the film, nor of the interested ones to watch it. While a small tent was rigged up at one place so that the projector could be kept dry during the showing, thirty-two people stood in the mist and showers to see the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Perseverance in the back-call ministry brings its rewards. Following the giving of a sermon on the name Jehovah, a woman took a booklet. On the return call the woman was not at home, but her husband was, and a sermon was given to him. On the second return call, neither the husband nor the wife was at home, but a further sermon was given to the woman’s brother. On the third return call only the son was in, and the publisher began to wonder if he would ever meet the woman again. But on the next call the whole family was home, a study was started and all four-are showing interest, though prior to this this family had shown no interest in the Kingdom message.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">One African from Okavango, on the northern boundary of the country, learned the truth when in Rhodesia and recently returned to his home. He began to preach to his neighbours, but, being all alone in the territory, was anxious to have some help. It was arranged for the circuit servant to visit him, though this meant a round trip of some five hundred miles. The circuit servant needed special permission to visit the area. When he arrived at the administrative centre for the area (about fifty miles from the brother’s village), he received the necessary permission, but found that he could not use his car since it did not meet the specifications required for vehicles travelling on the sandy tracks. Hopes of getting a ride on some other vehicle seemed doomed to disappointment, but then the police agreed to allow the circuit servant to travel in a police truck with an African constable as driver. Arriving at the village, he found the brother in eager anticipation of the visit. But there was another problem. The circuit servant and the brother could not converse, not knowing each other’s language. It was here that the police constable stepped in. He acted as an interpreter. This kindly police constable even agreed to prolong the stay so that the talk the brother had advertised to the villagers might be given. Again the constable acted as interpreter, and the twenty-five or more who gathered under a big tree to listen were delighted. The isolated brother is conducting a regular </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study as well as a study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book with the group. He himself was so encouraged by the visit that his report for the month showed he spent sixty hours in the ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The manager of a township housing employees of a large industry was approached in connection with the arranging of a circuit assembly in the township. He had been most impressed by the conduct of the brothers employed by the plant and made the comment: “They live what they believe and teach. I have served in the administration of African townships in many parts of Africa and have never found such fine people. Because of their honesty and conscientiousness they hold a number of very responsible positions here.’’ He gave every cooperation to make the assembly a success, and, after the assembly, he remarked how well organized everything had been and how the place had been kept clean and tidy. “Should your Society desire to hold your assembly here again,” he said, “please let me know early.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Visiting an area away from their home congregation during a visit there of the circuit servant, two publishers called on an African evangelist. A home Bible study was demonstrated on this first call, and, at the conclusion, the man said: “For many years I have been in a dark jungle concerning God’s purposes, and the mission cannot show me the way out. I know now that you people can. You must come back and teach me.” The publishers returned each day during that week to hold a home Bible study with the entire kraal (the patriarchal household of approximately sixteen persons). On Saturday evening he attended the circuit servant’s talk with three members of his family. On Sunday he went to his own church to tell the congregation what he had learned from the Witnesses, but sent his family to the public talk and the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font9">study.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">True Christians must never shrink back from their ministerial obligations when faced with governmental proscriptions and persecution. This was the situation that the Spanish brothers first faced in 1959, when the Spanish Minister of the Interior issued a series of circulars ordering the complete extirpation of the Christian work of Jehovah’s witnesses. During the seven years since that time a rash of fines, imprisonments and confiscations of property have broken out throughout the national territory. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, have refused to be intimidated and they have continued with their divinely commissioned preaching work during this troublesome season. At the close of 1958 there were, on an average, 894 of Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain, but today there are 4,302 witnesses of Jehovah, on the average. Persecution does not stop the witness work, nor do the threats of the police stop others from taking up the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Minister of the Interior has observed that his previous orders have not produced the desired results and now he has changed his directives and has fanatically ordered that any of Jehovah’s witnesses caught preaching the Bible should be clamped into prison on the charge of vagrancy. Nevertheless, unbigoted judges have seen Jehovah’s witnesses to be hardworking citizens, respectful of law and order, and they have refused to process even a single indictment up till now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain are happy that during the last year they have been able to “go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.” We are very happy to set out herewith some experiences had by our brothers in Spain, Andorra and the Canary Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Children have had an enthusiastic share in the witness work. One small girl, after having been asked to explain in class why she refused to attend mass, continued conversing about the subject after school with a classmate who showed interest, and they became fast friends. The Catholic teacher did everything possible to keep the two separated, finally even resorting to calling the interested girl’s father, to warn him about his daughter’s association with the young Witness. The father insisted that the teacher reveal to him the reason behind the warning, and her response aroused his curiosity. He asked to speak to the little girl, and, after conversing, asked her to have her mother drop by to visit him. After considering a flurry of Bible questions in the first interview with the mother, the man exclaimed: “At last, this is the truth!” and immediately a Bible study was established. In another case, a mother, who was initially not interested in Bible study, allowed her eleven-year-old daughter to study the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book with one of her schoolmates. Soon the mother noticed a marked improvement in her daughter’s behavior. Deciding to investigate more thoroughly, she, along with her other children, accepted an invitation to attend a presentation of one of the Society’s films, where she received an accurate idea of the world scope of the Bible education work. Now two of the children are Kingdom publishers, and the mother is also progressing well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fresh winds of change have been noted, not only in the political climate of the country, but in regard to the religious mood of the people as well. Changes of long-standing traditions made by the Vatican Council have caused bewilderment among the Catholic faithful. Though Jehovah’s witnesses have been judicially condemned literally dozens of times in recent years for threatening the enigmatic &quot;spiritual unity of Spain,” the public has come to see just how nebulous the term is as applied to the many opposing factions of Roman Catholics themselves. They have seen groups of Catholic priests as well as Catholic lay leaders take part in a number of skirmishes, both verbal and literal, not only against the secular authority, but against the very Spanish Episcopate as well! Such happenings have caused the people to be more willing to enter into conversation about religious subjects. They now see nothing wrong with examining the bases for their beliefs, just as they believe the Vatican Council has done. This has helped us to establish the work in several new areas, as well as to strengthen organized groups. Even in small towns where medieval-minded priests often control local activities with the autocratic air of despotic feudal lords, people are more willing to think for themselves. One such resident of a small village happened to visit his sister living in a large city precisely when a Bible study was being conducted with her. A witness was given, and a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book was placed with him. A long time passed before the man again presented himself in the city, and now he wanted to speak to the congregation overseer. “Well,” he exclaimed, “we are already nine Jehovah’s witnesses in the village, and now we need your help.” The man had studied by himself, and then had started to instruct others about the good things he had learned. Sure enough, upon visiting the village, the brothers got together with eight other young people who had all learned the truth from just the one copy of the book. Though they were inexperienced in knowledge, their respect and zealous desire to do God’s will truly amazed the brothers, and now arrangements have been made to help them progress in spiritual knowledge to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Uncompromising steadfastness for righteousness in the face of opposition is a desirable quality to develop and one that brings rich rewards. Cruel opposition started for a mother of three children when she dedicated her life to God in 1960. The crowning blow came four years later when her husband, goaded by in-laws, applied to a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical court for a legal separation, charging that his wife was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and that she was “poisoning” the minds of the children. Rather than give Bible counsel, the religious tribunal rabidly made false accusations against the sister, approved the marital separation, and, in addition, awarded custody of the two minor children to the father! Though all seemed lost, it being impossible to appeal the court’s ruling, the grief-stricken mother continued fervently to call on “the God who gives hope” by means of prayer. Some time later the separated husband by chance happened to meet an old friend. How surprised he was to learn that his friend was now a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses! After a two-hour discussion in the street, a Bible study was arranged at the minister’s home. The application of Bible principles reversed the unchristian ruling of the religious court, for early this year a reconciliation was brought about, and both parties feel “more united than ever before.” What is more, both father and mother as well as their two oldest children are now zealous participants in the Kingdom ministry! Certainly one should never lose the hope of saving an unbelieving marriage mate, no matter how bad the circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A fine witness has been given in Andorra during the year, and the literature placed has resulted in a number of new studies being started in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book. A young Indian woman was baptized during the year, even though her conversion from the Hindu religion brought about a permanent rupture in her relations with her family. Nevertheless, she has come to know and love her congregational “family,” and is making plans to help others to escape the clutches of Babylon the Great by her becoming a pioneer. Although long hours of secular work continue to be an obstacle to spiritual progress in Andorra, brothers were overjoyed to have twenty-two present at the Memorial celebration, and look forward to further blessings and progress during the coming year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It was just seven years ago that the work was established in the Canary Islands, and already three thriving congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses are busy extending the good news of the Kingdom throughout the island group. Truly the great Shepherd Jehovah knows how to seek out those who belong to him as his “other sheep.” One woman had her first contact with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> magazine as a girl while attending a convent school years ago. She was delighted with the illuminating Bible articles, but the nuns of the convent destroyed the magazines when they were found in her possession. Years later while traveling from the islands to Spain, she noticed that a good number of passengers were reading the same magazine. She found that they were Jehovah’s witnesses, bound for a foreign country in order to attend a Christian assembly. She gave them her address, and subsequently a Bible study was started with her. Now she faced the opposition of her husband and, for a time, tried substituting a Bible course conducted by </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> Catholic organization for her Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. What a disappointment it was to find that the subject of the Bible was barely considered, and she continued to feel spiritually famished. Finally, her quest to satisfy her spiritual need compelled her to seek out Jehovah’s witnesses again in order to renew her Bible study. Now she is progressing rapidly in accurate knowledge, and is moving ahead with plans to be present at all meetings as well as to participate in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SURINAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;345,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Just like ancient Babylon, Babylon the Great does not willingly open the way homeward for its prisoners. Jehovah’s witnesses must energetically go to all the population throughout Surinam, of which half is Hindu and Islam, in order to declare the good news. And go they do, be the people Catholic, Protestant, or any other religion. Our brothers in Surinam have found that it is difficult for people to flee from Babylon. But some are fleeing. Many of those who recently have been fleeing are from the Creole population and the Bush Negro population in the interior. With all the hard work on the part of the brothers, there has been some increase in activity and twenty-one more persons were baptized. Here are a few of the experiences the branch servant sent in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of these Bush Negroes had a bad fall and lives now at the home of one of our brothers in the capital. Although he can hardly walk, he still is very active in the service, and every week he turns in his field service report. Every morning he stands in front of his house, and talks to passersby and distributes literature. With one of these passersby he has established a Bible study. This person attends some of the meetings at the Kingdom Hall. So even though we may be weak physically, we still may be strong spiritually, like Paul, who said: “When I am weak, then I am powerful.”—2 Cor. 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It might sound strange to you if someone told you that a clergyman of the Anglican Church helped him to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. But many years ago a man immigrated to Surinam from Trinidad and worked as a gold miner in the bush. Because he was a faithful member of his church he contacted the clergyman of his church in the capital. This clergyman asked him: “Do you really want to be a member of this church?” “Of course,” he answered. “I see that you are an upright man,” the clergyman answered, “therefore I want to tell you that this religion is not the true religion. None of the religions of Christendom are teaching the truth. That may sound strange to you, since I myself am a clergyman. But still what I am telling you is right. I will show you what the truth is.” He got up and got a few books from the Watch Tower Society and handed them to him. “You may have these books. If you read them, you will find the truth. This is not the truth from the Watch Tower Society. It is the truth from God’s Word, the Bible. I plan to go back to England and will leave the church. Then I, too, will become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The man took his books and went in the bush, but every free moment he read the books. He realized that his clergyman had helped him to find the true religion. After many years in the bush, he retired from his work as a gold miner and returned to the capital. He was overjoyed to meet Jehovah’s witnesses there, got baptized and is a zealous Witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 7,772,506</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The outstanding event of the year in Sweden was the decision by Parliament not to call Jehovah’s witnesses to serve in the armed forces. This matter was fully reported on in the publications of the Society during the year. It certainly has made the hearts of the young men in Sweden glad to know they can go ahead with the preaching of the good news of the kingdom of God without interruption. Another event of great interest to the brothers was the fine convention held in Sweden during the year, which brought joy to the hearts of the brothers. Then came the arrival of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font10"> book in Swedish, and this, as the branch servant says, was the third big feature of the year. It arrived just before the convention. Many were the expressions of joy at the convention when this new publication was released. The branch office in Sweden was able to get some of the unassigned territory in the far north of the country covered by groups of special pioneers in August and September. Sweden received another good witness from its northernmost tip to its southernmost tip, and the brothers are rejoicing in their privileges of service. Here are a few items that the branch servant submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are many foreigners working in this country and quite a number are getting the truth. One such has an office that is a real center for his countrymen. One day he talked to a very aggressive member of an exile organization that is bent on killing political opponents and told him that the brother who had been studying with him was now in prison because of his faith, and at the same time he showed the man some magazines in their own tongue. The fellow laughed derisively but took with him two copies of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> Two weeks later when he returned, the magazines were quite worn out from study. This time he got a Bible, a book he had never seen before. After two more weeks he returned again to say that he had left the underground organization; he got a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book and more magazines. Thereafter he decided to return to his home country and “start Jehovah’s witnesses” in his native village. When warned that there he might risk his own life, he answered that he had no fear, and, besides, if anything be worthy of a person’s giving his life for it, that was the message of God’s kingdom. All this happened in less than two months. It is hoped that he will be taught more of the exact knowledge of the truth by the brothers in his own country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A twelve-year-old girl with whom a Bible study is conducted and who has begun to attend the congregation </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study one day had her turn to give a little speech in school. She brought the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book and read from it, explaining points by use of the illustrations as she went along. The teacher became so interested that she told the girl to sit at the teacher’s desk and tell them some more, even when the next lesson, which was to deal with mathematics, was due to begin. The girl told them about the study method used by the Witnesses and got an order for a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise </span><span class="font9">book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother has a desk at his place of work wherein he keeps copies of the magazines and booklets for his workmates to read at will (he works shifts). During the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> campaign he placed a bundle of subscription slips there and told the men that those who wanted to subscribe could fill in slips themselves and pay him when they met. In this way thirteen subscriptions were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SWITZERLAND &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,880,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">God’s sons of liberty in Switzerland were untiringly active during the past service year, despite the increasing indifference of the people in general as a result of the material prosperity. The pure worship of the true God, Jehovah, continues to increase. The publishers are learning how to teach the will of God more effectively and efficiently to honest-hearted ones. The new book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie”</span><span class="font10"> which they received at the beginning of the service year in German, French, Italian and Spanish, has helped them very much in starting new home Bible studies, and they reached a new peak in this field of the service. Here are <a name="bookmark173"></a><a name="bookmark174"></a>some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant on Switzerland and Liechtenstein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In working through her territory a sister had rung the bell on one door about twenty different times without an answer. This time a tall young man appeared at the door. He showed great interest but remarked that he would be away again for a few weeks. On his return the pioneer made a back-call with the Bible study servant and began a study at once. After a few weeks this young man began to attend meetings and after six months joined in the field service. Right from the start he spent twenty hours a month witnessing from house to house. At the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assembly he expressed his appreciation that the sister had exercised patience and had rung his bell repeatedly until she met him. He said he had often prayed to God to show him the true religion. Now he had found it and had changed his whole mode of living. Life seemed empty before, but now he sees that the true purpose of life is to dedicate oneself to Jehovah and serve Him always. He has changed his secular employment in order to have more time for study and service and is planning ahead for the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister studied a few years with a lady whose husband is very much opposed to the truth. He forbade her to enter his house, so the Bible study was continued in the home of a sister. Right from the start they recommended that this lady teach her children all the things they studied together, and she did this. After a time, however, she became fearful of her husband and the church minister. But her fourteen-year-old daughter came to her aid with the assuring words: “But, Mammy, we know this is the truth; you must not begin to doubt and get fearful now!” Reassured, she took fresh courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Memorial drew near and she wanted to attend. She begged her husband to let her go just this once. He was adamant and threatened divorce. The sister pointed out that she must bear the responsibility for her decision herself, to which she replied: “Yes, I know, I have hardly slept the last three weeks and have continually prayed to Jehovah for help. I must now show that I have taken my stand for the truth; I have decided to come.” As she had to leave before her husband returned home, she left a note telling him where she had gone. Her husband followed her without delay and overtook her before she could enter the Kingdom Hall. A struggle ensued. The lady remained steadfast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Completely exhausted, she entered the hall a few minutes before the meeting began. But the harder part, the homecoming, awaited her, because her husband had said she need not return home. She was prepared for the worst, but instead her husband received her into his arms! What had happened? The man had gone into a restaurant on his way home. Here another man had described his family life: five children, plenty of work and a wife who left everything in disorder to go out with other men. This brought the man abruptly to his senses. Unfortunately his changed attitude has not endured; he is still opposed to his wife’s having contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. She is courageous, however, and goes alone from house to house and seeks to serve Jehovah. Her daughter will be taking up the service too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LIECHTENSTEIN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19,304</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The few publishers residing here do their best to make known the everlasting good news in their </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Ländli,”</span><span class="font9"> and the publishers from the neighboring Swiss congregations are happy to lend their support. The distribution of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Awake!”</span><span class="font9"> issue containing the article on Liechtenstein was an outstanding event for them. The whole territory was covered with this special issue, and the publishers had great joy in having a share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All the overseers of the congregations taking part reported that the publishers could talk freely with the people. One servant wrote: “Every one of us commented joyfully on the good reception we had with the people.” Another overseer wrote: “We all had much joy. The people were friendly and we could give a good witness in many homes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Press and Public Relations Department of the government sent the office of the Society in Berne a letter of thanks for the good article in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font9"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TAIWAN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 12,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">There is much work to be done in the island of Taiwan, both among those associated with Jehovah’s organization and with the millions who know nothing of the truth about God. Whole cities with populations of over 250,000 lie untouched. No one has ever gone into them that we know of to declare the good news of God’s kingdom. With Jehovah’s blessing and aid it is the hope of Jehovah’s witnesses to reach out into many more of these cities and express the lifegiving message of truth to the people, that they may learn the way of life. The missionaries the Society has sent there are very grateful for the share they have in this work, and they rejoice as they see good progress being made on the part of the local brothers in their growth to maturity. They are happy, too, to see new ones associating with Jehovah’s people. Here are some experiences from the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The decrease that Taiwan has experienced the past few years since strenuous efforts were started to bring the local brothers into closer harmony with the Bible’s high principles has eased some this past year, although there was still a 4-percent decrease for the whole island. This decrease comes from the tribes where many who have been associated for many years have had very little knowledge of the Bible and few in the congregations knew how to read and write. At that time all instruction in the congregation depended on having someone who could translate from another language into the Amis or other tribal language, and in many cases the translation left much to be desired, for the translator had perhaps no more than four years’ schooling. During the latter half of the service year efforts were made to teach the Amis brothers, of whom there are about one thousand, a newly developed form of writing that uses Roman letters. At the same time the booklet </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom” </span><span class="font9">was prepared as their first Amis Bible-study aid, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> and Theocratic Ministry School material began to appear in this form of writing. The results to the present time are very encouraging, and it is hoped that good results will continue as more of the brothers master the art of reading and thus gain a more accurate knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Illustrating how some congregations have benefited, one circuit servant tells of visiting a congregation before they were taught the new system of writing. Even though he had been assured that the service meeting and school had been assigned and prepared, when the meeting time arrived none of the parts were prepared as no one had been able to understand the material assigned. “Not only I, but all were discouraged,” the circuit servant states. “Under these circumstances I was at a loss what to do to help these brothers hold regular meetings. The answer came when we learned of the new method of writing. A course was held to teach the servants how to use the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> and other publications to put on their meetings,” he writes. At the time of his next visit, how pleasantly surprised he was to be able to participate in meetings that had been prepared without the need for any translators of the material to be considered! “As more of the brothers learn to read fluently, there is no doubt that more maturity will be seen among the Amis brothers,” he concludes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible truths taught in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> and other publications can make a big change in a person’s way of thinking, as an experience related by a new missionary shows. During her second month in the country she obtained a subscription from a student about to graduate from college. This person read the magazine diligently and started attending meetings in addition to the home Bible study she was having. As the missionary tells it: “She continues to be surprised at all the things she learns from the Bible. She learned from her study about the sanctity of blood and showed herself to be anxious to apply the principle in her daily life, so now she refuses any dishes that contain blood even though her mother and brother continue to eat these. She related how she told her mother she could no longer worship her dead father and the angry reaction of her mother, who said: ‘Are you going to forget the one who gave you life?’ Her reply was: ‘No, I could never do that, but I cannot worship my dead father, as we must worship Jehovah God only. Maybe Jehovah will even remember him in the resurrection.’ ” It is hoped that this person and many others like her will join in helping the millions here who have heard nothing of Jehovah to learn of his righteous requirements for life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The biggest obstacle that Jehovah’s witnesses have in Thailand is penetrating the veil of Buddhist philosophy, but we continue to try because Christ Jesus commanded that this good news of the Kingdom should be preached in all the world, and then the end would come. In Thailand, as one of the great nations of the world, Jehovah’s witnesses have done good work in finding some who have then turned from this old system of things and have studied about God’s new order of things under Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses in Thailand are very pleased with the good distribution of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> magazine. This has opened up the way for more Bible studies to be started. Despite the hard going, they still have had many very interesting experiences. The branch servant in Bangkok looks after the work in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Here is how he reports conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A special pioneer working in a Buddhist city in the heart of the country reports as follows: “One day while working the town I called on a railway official who asked many questions. Although he did not believe in God, my answers seemed to satisfy him and he took the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font9"> On my returning a week later, he was not home but I started a study with his wife. The neighbors mocked her, but she continued. After about a month the husband returned and, on hearing about the study, he sent his wife around to tell me he wanted to study with the whole family, although he would only be able to join once a month. Two years later, after his wife had inquired about publishing, the husband was home for ten days’ vacation. On explaining the need for him to be with his family and study regularly, he acted, and within two months he was living in town and studying regularly. Within a few months he was offering himself for service and baptism, but he was not suitably clean yet in his way of life. On being told of the need to register his marriage, he did just that, and he, his wife and seven children, all turned up for the district assembly, where both he and his wife were baptized.” The special pioneer who had moved on to another territory in the meantime was, of course, very happy to meet them at the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The value of the Theocratic Ministry School is shown by the following experience: A special pioneer sister from the Philippines who had been assigned to Thailand to help with the work here had just completed her second month of studying the Thai language when she received her first assignment to give a student talk at the ministry school. It was to be based on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sermon Outlines,</span><span class="font9"> on the subject of marriage. It seemed a rather difficult subject for someone who had just begun to speak Thai, but the sister managed to prepare an appropriate setting, an introduction and some good transitions to tie together the scriptures she had selected, and her first talk in Thai went over all right. Now, lo and behold, not many days afterward, while making a back-call on a woman who had taken a subscription for the Thai </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> this Filipino sister was asked the very same question that her householder had asked her in her demonstration in the ministry school. Her notes for her student talk were still in her Bible, so the sister proceeded to give her prepared talk to the subscriber, who was very satisfied with the answer to her question. A Bible study was started, and soon this person came to the Kingdom Hall to hear a public lecture, and she stayed for the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CAMBODIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 5,750,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: 1 to 2,875,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The lone publisher that was here at the beginning of the service year after the missionaries had to leave the country has made a constant effort to be regular in the field service. He has been faithful in helping one person who showed a sincere interest in the truth while the missionaries were still there to grow in spiritual understanding to the point of dedication and baptism. This new brother is well on in years and is quite ill but he is determined to do what he can to praise Jehovah’s name. He clearly understands that there is only one true organization. He sees the part Babylon the Great is playing today, and the need to take one’s stand on Jehovah’s side. The two brothers encourage one another in their isolation and are very pleased to have regular visits from the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">LAOS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,000,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">A highlight of the year was a circuit assembly with the showing of the film, which, in spite of the small attendance, still had to be narrated in two languages. The second language group listened to their own commentary while viewing it through windows at the rear of the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One special pioneer who came all the way from Canada has been a great source of encouragement to all, as she exudes such zeal and joy in her service. Although she speaks French, which is understood by some of the more educated ones, her love for the common people has spurred her to learn Laotian. Each day she packs her bag with Bibles in two or three languages, books in three or four and an assortment of booklets and magazines in five or six languages and walks in the hot tropical sun all day long, aiding and feeding those kindly disposed toward God’s message of truth. She left two children and five grandchildren behind to come and help where the need is greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">VIETNAM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 15,317,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 24 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 638,208</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Amidst the troubled conditions in this war-torn nation, Jehovah’s witnesses are developing a strong congregation. There are now two missionary homes in Saigon, and the missionaries are doing good work in building up interest in the capital city and laying </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font9">foundation for the future. Due to the war it is not possible to preach in the countryside now, but should the war ever stop there will be Vietnamese-speaking publishers and missionaries ready to take the comforting truths of Jehovah’s kingdom to the oppressed people there. One isolated Vietnamese publisher continues strong in faith and is doing very good work in the central city of Nha Trang, about 200 miles north of Saigon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the beginning of the service year in September a study was started with a middle-aged Vietnamese man. Like many of his compatriots, he had despised the French colonial rulers of his country and resented the unfairness and human indignities suffered under the colonial system. So he became a revolutionary, thinking that the overthrow of the French rule would bring happiness to his country. For eight years he was a Communist, working in the rice fields, but at the same time he was carrying on underground work for the Communists against the French. Later, when the Diem government came to power in Vietnam, this man was arrested and imprisoned for a number of years because he was known as a Communist. But then, when Diem was murdered and his government replaced by a military government in 1963, this man was released. By this time he could see the mounting tensions and how the revolutionary movement had not brought happiness to his people. Although he had become practically atheistic, he now wondered where he could turn to find something better. A friend directed him to a Protestant church, which he attended for over a year. But after reading </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> for five months during that same period, he decided to get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses. Now he has found what he has been looking for during his whole lifetime. Now he realizes that peace and happiness can come to Vietnam and the whole world of mankind only by means of Jehovah’s kingdom. Since March he has been a Kingdom publisher, and all the brothers in Saigon rejoice to have his association at the weekly meetings and to observe his steady progress in the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TRINIDAD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;794,624</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses in this island just north of South America enjoyed a 5-percent increase this past year and they now have 1,799 publishers regularly sharing in the Kingdom ministry. One thing that helped considerably was the increase in the number of Bible studies. They are conducting 1,831 in the island, and with this many studying the Bible we can hope some persons are going to decide to take their stand for the truth. One of the important events for the year for the Trinidad branch was the forming of a new branch in Barbados. This used to be some of the territory under the Trinidad branch office, but now a group of the islands have been transferred to the branch office established in Bridgetown, Barbados. From there we can give better attention to the congregations. But Trinidad still has plenty to do in looking after the interests of the Kingdom in congregations in Trinidad and Tobago. Here are some experiences from both places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“After reading the experience in the June 15, 1965, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> ‘Infants not too young to learn,’ we gave our two-year-old daughter, Donna, a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book and started teaching her from the pictures in it. She is doing all right, and at the home at Mayaro, where we were guests while serving that congregation, a group of neighbors visited. As soon as the conversation slowed down, Donna brought out the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book and began to explain the pictures, much to the delight of all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the Trinidad </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font9"> of January 1966 encouraged the direct approach in getting Bible studies, some of the publishers have been trying this. They are enthusiastic about this method. A young Bible study servant made up his mind to try it out so that he would be able to help others get started in the Bible study work. In one morning he was able to start five studies, three of which are continuing, and the persons studied with are showing good interest and making progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A teen-ager met a woman who was busy washing. “After explaining that my purpose in calling was to encourage the study of the Bible in the homes of the people, and that this service was free of charge, she replied: ‘Certainly I will be glad to have a study in my home.’ I demonstrated the study, using the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font9"> booklet, and she surprised me with the ready answers she had. In answer to the question: ‘Why is it wrong to worship God through an image?’ She replied: ‘No man has ever seen God, so how can we make an image of him since we do not know what he looks like, and, what is more, the Bible says we are not to make images of any kind.’ After the study she commented: ‘Everyone should be having a Bible study instead of talking about others’ business.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do you have difficulty getting business associates to listen to a witness? By being tactful and resourceful sometimes interest can be aroused. A schoolteacher found that a fellow teacher always rejected the message, but solved the problem this way: “I had a student talk coming up on the subject of the prophet Zephaniah. So I decided to ask her to let me rehearse it with her, and this I explained to her would help me to carry out my assignment. Well, the questions started then—‘What was the “Great Day”?’ and so forth. Every day at lunch hour there were more questions and answers. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Impossible to Lie’</span><span class="font9"> book was introduced and a study was started after school. She began coming to the book study, big changes began to be made in her life, and she wants her little girl to be brought up like Jehovah’s witnesses. Attending Kingdom Hall meetings and going in field service are already goals set and achieved by her.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Keeping the organization clean certainly brings Jehovah’s blessing. A publisher whose husband died promptly began a consensual relationship with another man, and when she was disfellowshiped she quarreled at home so the neighbors would know how “unjustly” she was treated by Jehovah’s witnesses. The circuit servant’s wife called on the neighbor and, knowing the situation, tried tactfully to explain that the organization stands for clean living. The neighbor replied that she never had so much respect for Jehovah’s witnesses until she heard the woman say that she was put out of the religion for her conduct. The neighbor is now having a Bible study and attends the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TOBAGO &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33,333</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">One of the highlights of the year was the showing of the film “Proclaiming 'Everlasting Good News’ Around the World” for the first time in the island. A total of 437 were in attendance at the showings and a fine impression was made. One man said: “I never knew that this religion was so big. I have never heard about so many people being baptized at one time.” A woman was heard to exclaim: “But this is a massive organization with different races. Seeing a few of Jehovah’s witnesses in this island, one would not think that the organization is that big!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">URUGUAY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 2,598,000</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Economic conditions continued to get more difficult in Uruguay, with the result that many brothers have had to spend more of their time providing for their daily necessities. Still they were able to average 10.7 hours per congregation publisher throughout the year. Jehovah’s witnesses in this country feel as though they have a more sound and tightly knit organization now than before because much attention was given to each of the congregations during the year in regard to aiding the new and weak ones to progress to maturity through the assistance that was given them by the circuit servants and the overseers in the congregations. They have endeavored to help the brothers so as to be good teachers and really make disciples of those who are coming into the organization now. They realize that persons should have a good understanding of the Bible before they are invited to share in the field ministry. Here are a few experiences sent in by the branch servant of Uruguay along with some words about the Falkland Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sheeplike ones often have their first contact with the truth through </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font9"> A young woman remembers in her childhood her parents’ receiving </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> which she also read and enjoyed. Years later this woman saw a few loose pages of the magazine that had been thrown away in a neighbor’s home. Not wanting to appear impudent, she did not stoop down to pick them up, although this was her desire. A few days passed and then this woman sent for some eggs from the neighbor where she had seen the magazine. What a surprise to receive the eggs wrapped up in pages of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> and how much more joy she had when she saw that they contained a discussion of her own problem relative to marital relationships.’ In her desire to have her husband read these pages, she cleaned them off the best she could and put them on the table. A couple of months passed but the marital situation did not improve and the wife began divorce proceedings, yet she continued praying to God for guidance. Then one of Jehovah’s witnesses appeared. Unable to retain her problem, she related it to the brother, who gladly showed her Scriptural counsel and started a home Bible study. After a few studies she and her husband attended a public meeting. She continued her study in spite of a new problem—opposition from her parents and neighbors. The result: she has symbolized her dedication, and her formerly opposed mother and two of her neighbors are now studying the Bible with her, while she and her husband live peacefully together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Searching for a purpose in life can lead one to demonism, but a knowledge of the truth is the only real reward. A young sister writes: “About two years ago I felt that my existence was hollow and I preferred not to exist, yet I sensed the need of something. In search for belief I turned to Rosacrucianism, spiritism and the practice of telepathy. As time passed by, my interest deepened and then I began to feel strange things occurring in my body, such as my hands and arms being lifted up against my will. I waited for the day that the Witnesses would call at my home again, as my mother had studied formerly but then lost interest. Finally that day arrived and I began to study, but with opposition from my family. Gradually the strange things occurring in my body stopped, but my father began to oppose my studying and Finally put me out of the house. I realized that being one of Jehovah’s witnesses was not an easy thing, but I continued studying and today I am happy to be one of them.” This sister now enjoys the pioneer service. Her faithfulness has been rewarded in now seeing her family, eleven in all, studying the Bible, including her father. Recently her mother and a brother were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FALKLAND ISLANDS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,100</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Two brothers from the United Kingdom who offered to serve in the Falkland Islands where the need is great made the long ocean voyage across the Atlantic to the port town of these two hundred small islands off the southeastern tip of South America, but had to return to Scotland because of not being able to rent a home for their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society again sent two missionaries for a two month visit. The visits by the missionaries once a year are very helpful so that the righteous-hearted ones have some personal contact with the work. After visiting for two months, tears are shed as the missionaries depart, because there is no local congregation organized with someone assigned to conduct the weekly meetings. There are, however, three or four families that would make up a local group if there were someone to aid them. One of the local religions lost its pastor this year and within this group are several persons who are similar to those of whom Jesus said: “On seeing the crowds he felt pity for them, because they were skinned and thrown about like sheep without a shepherd.” (Matt. 9:36) A number of these people have literature and manifest kindness now toward Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">VENEZUELA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 9,030,328</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 4,395 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 2,055</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paul said: “Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. And let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:23, 24) The same thing is true in Venezuela as in other countries. Some of the brothers did not hold fast but have wavered and have stopped coming to meetings and sharing in the field service. However, the majority of them have held fast and are enjoying the ministry. They worked hard during the past year and they have helped one another, inciting to love and fine works by not neglecting the house of their God. Many of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study meetings have more than 100-percent attendance. Here are some interesting experiences that were sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A new missionary couple in the country relate this experience: “When we first arrived in our foreign assignment we had few words of the new language to work with. The situation seemed awkward, and we wondered how long it would be before our service would be productive. But we soon learned that it is Jehovah who brings the increase. My wife obtained a subscription from a young woman and arranged to call back when the husband was home. When we returned he had a number of basic questions to test our knowledge about the Bible’s origin in general. When he seemed satisfied with the answers he was ready to get into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font9"> booklet. Before the next visit he purchased a Bible for the family. The amazing thing was that we would answer his questions with crude sentences and undoubtedly misplaced words, and, never changing his facial expression, he would say, Tn other words, let’s say . . .’ and he would repeat the whole thing back in minute detail, but, of course, correctly. We learned that the man is a professor and his enthusiastic wife, a teacher. He is also a Guajiro Indian, and thus from one of the best-known tribes in Venezuela. His tribesmen have been difficult to reach for the most part because of speaking their own distinct language. The couple both seem to be making fine progress. They have inquired about how the good news can be heard by such tribes of Indians as his own and seem anxious to visit their relatives with their newly acquired truths from the Bible. Due to a consistent program of directing interested ones to the organization, this couple, although not yet having completed the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Good News’</span><span class="font9"> booklet, are attending the meetings and enthusiastically express the desire to bring some of their friends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A Bible study conducted in a neighborhood is often an indirect witness to those in the vicinity. In one village it was the subject of discussion by the family next door and some Sunday visitors. Gradually this family became interested so that later, when the visitors came, as they frequently did, they found their friends having a study in their own home. The Witness who conducted the study took the opportunity to explain several points about the future according to the Bible, but the visitors took it lightly, joking somewhat. They did, however, accept a few invitations to the Kingdom Hall in the village and went to the national assembly in the capital. The woman particularly was impressed by these meetings and the explanations her friends gave her of all they were learning, though she herself could not read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Arrangements were made for a Witness to go to her own home to study more conveniently. Anticipating the coming visit and having learned by now that “holy” pictures and images had no place in true Christianity, she hastily removed all of hers, poured on kerosene and burned them. When the man came home from work, he asked: “What have you done?” She told him, but added: “I didn’t touch yours!” That night she was fearful to go to sleep; seeing the walls and room bare, she felt unprotected and thought surely she would have wild dreams. The study was held regularly and the couple progressed rapidly in understanding. The man removed his “saints,” too, of his own accord. As their appreciation increased, they realized that to dedicate their lives to Jehovah would require a radical change in the home. They had been living eight years together, but, as circumstances hindered the legalizing of the marriage, the man volunteered to leave. Prayerfully and obediently they took this difficult step, and within a year both were baptized. The woman has learned to read. Both are zealous publishers, improving their reading ability constantly to be more effective in the preaching work. Now their friends in the village are Witnesses also, so, when they get together, it is not to discuss what the neighbors are doing with the Bible but to relate their own personal experiences and joys in Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another experience of a brother tells how he would witness to his fellow workers at his place of employment, and with those who showed interest he was able to build up a magazine route and place forty magazines every month. Noting the interest of some, he organized a small group and would talk to them about the Bible during the lunch hour. He would talk about a different subject each day and answer their questions. One day he talked about marriage and its problems of today, and after the discussion one man came to him privately and presented his problem. He said that he was living with a woman but was not married legally to her, and the family was after him to marry the girl. Several weeks later he solved his problem and married the girl under the law of Venezuela. A Bible study was established in this home, and now they are publishers of the good news also.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in Yugoslavia again had a very pleasant year in the field ministry, with a good 6-percent increase in publishers. They carried</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">on their ministry in a very fine manner, too, because they had the opportunity of talking to many people and starting home Bible studies with those showing interest. Here are some fine experiences that have been sent in by the one looking after the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the town of S---- a new congregation was</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">formed recently. In this place a brother persevered faithfully for twenty-six full years with no visible results. But in 1957, after twenty-six years, he made the first disciple, and a man was immersed. Soon after this, two women were baptized, so there were four publishers in that place. These four publishers kept on working diligently in the ministry in spite of the fact that the population is very Catholic and hatred against Jehovah’s witnesses was publicly preached from the church pulpit. The brothers also preached in the nearby communities. In a relatively short time this resulted in fourteen persons’ being baptized and, according to the latest report, there are now twenty-two regular publishers in that town and its environs. But it took twenty-six years of faithful endurance and hope until the harvest really began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A publisher witnessed to a man and then sent his address by way of the Branch to the nearest congregation. In the meantime this interested man kept looking for Jehovah’s witnesses, and in his search for the truth he was directed to a meeting of the Seventh-day Adventists. After the meeting he was asked how he liked it. He drew a copy of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> out of his pocket and said: “This is what I am looking for, because this is the truth.” He told the Adventists that Christians are not under obligation to keep the Mosaic law and he gave them a good witness. As he left the hall, a young man followed him and said he thought he was right and would like to get to know Jehovah’s witnesses too. The following day a publisher called on this man due to the back-call address he had received, and now this interested man regularly attends our meetings, in company of the young man he found in the meeting of the Adventists. Shortly after this the young wife of the first interested man came to pay her husband a visit, as his profession made it necessary to work away from home. Some person had told the wife that ‘her husband would certainly leave her, having now accepted a new religion and started having intimate relations with a number of women of this new religion.’ Of course, the wife became very upset and angry and said she wanted a divorce herself. The husband, however, pacified her somewhat and invited her to stay with him until Sunday and then attend the meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses and see for herself what kind of people they were, and to this she agreed. She was received very kindly and attended a second meeting. She was so moved by what she heard and the kindness of the brothers and sisters that she wept; and when she left the congregation, she apologized for having believed the bad rumor about Jehovah’s witnesses and her husband. Both husband and wife continued to study, and a few months later both were immersed. The wife has become very active and has already found a number of interested persons in the village where she lives. The man also is zealous for the truth in the place where he does secular work. Indeed, it was worthwhile that the publisher who got the back-call slip made the call and made it promptly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ZAMBIA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population: 3,496,500</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak Publishers: 30,738 Ratio: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 to 114</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Continual pressure is brought to bear on Jehovah’s witnesses in Zambia. This is mainly due to the fact that the brothers have wanted to maintain their Christian neutrality. Children going to school refused to share in paying homage to the state symbol, nor would they join in singing national prayers or anthems. In a number of areas children have been expelled from school, and in December 1965 the branch servant, who had served there faithfully for seventeen years, was asked to leave. Some officials seemed to think the neutral, integrity-keeping course on the part of the brothers and their children was due to their following one man, but they soon learned differently. The brothers continue as before, because they are serving Jehovah God and understand his principles of truth and righteousness. Here are some interesting experiences sent in by the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many more are now sharing in the vacation pioneer ministry, and the experiences they send in reflect the joy this service has brought them. One writes: “In Jehovah’s power I worked two months as a vacation pioneer, and then when I received my regular pioneer application I found that I was suffering from leprosy. I had to go to a hospital administered by a Roman Catholic mission. When I arrived I was asked if I were one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and when I told them that I was, they said that they did not want Jehovah’s witnesses here. As I was here I was allowed to remain, but they said they did not want me to read the magazines here, particularly </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font9">as this would lead me to form a congregation of Witnesses. For three days they argued with me to turn me to their religion. Finally I said I would ask the government about this, as the constitution guaranteed freedom of worship. Those in charge became fearful and asked me not to do that, but agreed to allow me to pray and study alone in my house. However, I told them that I could not refrain from speaking about the truth. I am now preaching, and as a result we have formed an isolated group of twenty-one interested persons. Of this number six are former publishers who had failed to identify themselves as Witnesses because of religious pressure. They have now been reactivated and the group holds regular meetings.” The brother continues: “Of course, I am sick, but this sickness cannot prevent me from serving Jehovah. Our big need is for magazines so that we can have our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font9"> study.” A group subscription was sent for the publishers, and arrangements were made for the circuit servant to visit this new isolated group begun in a leper colony by a vacation pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Eastern Province local government officials have tried to stop the brothers from going from house to house and, because of the brothers’ neutral stand with regard to politics, their Kingdom Halls, homes and food granaries have been burned to the ground. One brother who reported to the police the man alleged to be responsible for burning a Kingdom Hall was himself sentenced to prison. At the Society’s intervention the case was investigated and the brother released. The publishers from this area then wrote to tell us that the trouble they had endured had helped the local people to see the truth. Previously in their territory there were eight villages in which they were not able to witness, but now they are making calls there and conducting Bible studies.. Before the trouble there were five publishers in this isolated group, but now the number has risen to twenty-four, including five relatives of the man thought to have burned down the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sometimes those who hope in politics and bitterly oppose the truth become disillusioned and seek out the Witnesses. A brother reports that when he was going from house to house a man demanded that he show his political party card before he would allow him to preach. When the brother failed to produce a card, this man became violently angry and threatened the brother and ordered him to go. When the brother returned to the congregation he suggested to the other publishers that it would be better to pass this person’s house because of his violent attitude. For six months the brothers always passed this house on their way to field service. Finally, the man approached the brothers and complained: “If you neglect me, I will die, because unless a person studies with Jehovah’s witnesses he shall not get life.” The brother who was first threatened by this person started a Bible study with him, and now this former politician is also witnessing from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brother was rewarded with the joy of conducting an enthusiastic Bible study because of exercising Christian hospitality and not neglecting to give thanks at mealtimes. As part of his secular duties this brother had to show a new employee the house assigned to him. Realizing it was near time for the midday meal and that, as this stranger’s wife had not yet arrived in the country, he would have nowhere to go for his meal, our brother invited him to his home to take, as he put it, “pot luck.” As usual, the brother offered thanks to Jehovah. As soon as he finished giving thanks, the stranger exclaimed: “I knew it. You are Jehovah’s witnesses. My wife is also a baptized Witness, but for many years I have been opposed. However, I am now beginning to change my mind and I would like to have a Bible study.” The study was begun and soon he was attending meetings. The wife has arrived with the children from England and now the whole family are unitedly attending at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With independence many opportunities for advancement have come to the local African people and this means that many temptations to materialism are presented to the brothers, since they are among the more progressive and industrious employees. One brother had just received his Bethel application when his firm, a large corporation with branches world wide, selected him for a special five-year programme of training in accountancy while serving in one of their larger offices in Europe or the Americas. From a worldly viewpoint this was a prized opportunity of a lifetime. What should he do? Our brother made it a matter of earnest prayer, realizing that here was a clear choice between succumbing to a materialistic temptation and seeking Kingdom interests first, and made his decision. He is now happily serving at Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister who was a cook at a school started a Bible study with her fifteen-year-old sister, a pupil in the same school. Next the schoolgirl attended the district assembly. Her interest was so aroused by this assembly that, when she returned to school, she began witnessing to her fellow students. As a result, six other girls joined in studying with her and her older sister in the book </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font9"> When this young girl returned to her own village, she started attending the meetings despite her father’s opposition. Eventually the whole village was called together to ask her questions and to learn why she had taken up this new religion and had left the religion of her father. She fearlessly answered them: “I do not want inherited religion. I want the believed one. Paul changed his; I must also change mine. God is well pleased with this, I know.” At this her father started crying out loudly, but his crying never changed her mind. The faithful stand of this young sister has caused interest to be aroused in the surrounding villages where there was previously apathy or opposition. The young sister was looking forward to being baptized at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TWELVE OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WORK UNDER DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not wise, due to the difficult situation under which Jehovah’s witnesses work in the countries here reported on, to give any figures as to the number of Witnesses in each country. In most of these nations it is necessary to work, as it were, underground. Our brothers in such places have regular meetings, but not in public places. Usually they meet in the homes of brothers who are wholly devoted to Jehovah God and who are willing to have their fellow Witnesses meet with them, usually in secret, in order to study the Word of God. This is not a new thing. Ever since Christianity began it has been necessary for some to hide themselves when they wanted peace and quiet to study the Word of God. While Jehovah’s Christian witnesses hide themselves, as they did centuries ago in the catacombs to carry on true worship, still they continue to give a public witness, but not by going from door to door. In many of these countries they seek out people that they feel they can speak with about God’s promises, or that they have heard are interested in the Bible; or in general conversation with neighbors they will sometimes bring up the Bible and its teachings to see how the people feel about it. Perhaps over a period of weeks, and even sometimes for months, they have to be cautious so as to be sure that the ones listening are sincere in wanting to discuss the Bible. If such ones prove truly sincere, then in time they may be invited to join with a group of Jehovah’s witnesses in a deeper study of God’s Word. Sometimes the interested stranger is a spy and wants to expose Jehovah’s witnesses to the government or to religionists who hate them. This often results in the Witnesses’ being cast into prison, or other measures are brought against them to make it almost impossible for them to carry on the work of discipling people of all nations. This cautious way of carrying on the work is not necessary in every country that is hereafter discussed. In a few of these nations Jehovah’s witnesses do go from door to door and conduct Bible studies openly in the homes of the people. But they are still a people not desired. It is not good to reveal the number of Jehovah’s witnesses in any one of these because of the persecution that they must endure. All of us look forward to the day when this hiding will no longer be necessary. The time will come when all persons, from one end of the earth to the other, will praise Jehovah God. What a grand day that will be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ALBANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Albania the brothers have to continue to put up a hard fight for the faith. Many of the brothers are in prison or under some form of restraint. It has become very difficult to meet to study together, but the dedicated servants of Jehovah are determined to hold onto their faith. One wrote briefly, saying: “Remember us in your prayers to keep us strong in faith.” It was not possible during the service year to send any reports of field service. We very much appreciate the examples of courage we see in our Albanian brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bulgaria is under strict Communist rule, and this means that our brothers there do not enjoy the precious freedom to preach publicly and from house to house. But, nevertheless, the message of Jehovah’s kingdom is being preached also in that land, and there are a good number of hearing ears. Many people are very dissatisfied with the conditions and have completely lost their trust in the churches, which cannot offer any hope. For honest hearts the Kingdom message is a great comfort. More people than in previous years have come in touch with the truth and more persons than before have taken part in spreading the truth. But it will take time and patience to bring to maturity those who study the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past year we have continued to try to make contact with some of our brothers in China, but there has been no response. It is very doubtful if any of our messages ever reach them. For the second year in succession all efforts to get any word from them have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers in Czechoslovakia have done a good work, and the government has shown itself more tolerant than in former years, so the brothers do not have very many difficulties at the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For many years a young girl used to go to the Catholic church every Sunday, although the church was 14 kilometers (8.68 miles) away from her home. Her religious devotion was so strong that out of her own free will she entered a convent and became a nun. But as time went by she became more and more disappointed, as she disliked the cold atmosphere of the convent; so she left that institution. She still attended church, but it left her dissatisfied. Her brother is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but she refused to listen to anything that he would say in matters of religion. One day she asked him to come and help her to do some heavy work. The brother took off his jacket and started on the job. His sister chanced to see a notebook in the pocket of her brother’s jacket. Curiously she examined it and found some Bible quotations and explanations. Quickly and secretly she copied some of this Bible information and then looked up various texts in her own Bible. This had a great effect upon her. She stopped going to church. Her brother arranged for a Bible study with her, and today she is happy to be a devoted servant of Jehovah, together with her husband and three children. Indeed, honest persons find the way out of Babylon the Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Oftentimes opposition to the truth is based on prejudice, behind which there is an honest but blinded heart. This was so in the case of a young man, a Catholic. He was a declared enemy of Jehovah’s witnesses. He strictly forbade his wife to take part in our Bible discussions and threatened that he would even beat her if she did. In his opinion the religion of Jehovah’s witnesses was for old women only. Then one day two brothers, although they knew this man’s attitude toward us, paid him a visit. When they entered his house, they kindly but frankly explained the purpose of their visit: to talk with him about God’s Word. He was very much surprised, even shocked. But the brothers proceeded with their purpose, and within a short time an interesting conversation about the Bible ensued. Before the two brothers left, he agreed to a second visit the following week. The man invited his uncle for this second call, an older man, and he was interested right from the start. A study was started, based on the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book, and both men made rapid progress in making their minds over. The two publishers said that this was the best study they had ever conducted. Both the wife of this former enemy and the uncle’s wife joined the study group. The younger man, on his own initiative, used every opportunity to give a witness about the truth. When the study had been conducted for about two years, both men and their wives were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EAST GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers in Communist East Germany went through trying times in the course of the past twelve months. It seemed that the authorities had set themselves to make a general offensive in order to crush the work. But all of this could not dampen the joy of the faithful publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The secret police were very active and molested many publishers by searching their homes, picking them up for interrogation and spying on them. Listening-in devices were secretly installed in their homes and even micro-transmitters in their cars, in order to make the publishers feel that they could not do a thing without the secret police knowing it instantly. One early morning last November a countrywide raid was made by teams of eight officials on the homes of brothers. The homes were searched for hours, fifteen brothers were finally taken to prison, it being assumed that they were the most responsible ones, so that throwing them into jail would certainly paralyze their preaching work. The brothers were kept in prison for nine months for interrogation before the first ones were brought to trial. One of them was sentenced to twelve years in a penitentiary while others received terms of eight years. These were the highest sentences given for years to brothers in any Communist-controlled country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But, to their despair, the authorities noticed that all their efforts had been in vain. One of their officials interrogating a publisher exclaimed: “We thought we had taken away your leaders, but we have only lost track of your work.” As atheistic materialists they have difficulty in comprehending that, not men, but Jehovah’s spirit is directing his people. The message of God’s kingdom as the only true hope for mankind has been preached without letup and many more people have been reached by the faithful, fearless publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A married couple making initial calls met an elderly householder. He told them that his wife had been bedridden for a year and they were now expecting her-to die soon. They had been praying to God, but their prayers had not been answered, and he had lost his faith in God. The publishers explained the reason for the conditions today, for sickness and death, and what kind of prayers would be answered by God. A back-call was arranged, but it had to be postponed twice. Then the householder asked them to return on Sunday morning. How surprised were the publishers when they entered the room and saw the man’s wife, with a beaming face, sitting on the lounge. Her husband had told her of the two ministers who had been calling and she wanted to listen to them too. She had been reading the Bible so often, but could not understand it. So she prayed to God to send her somebody who would help her do so. A home Bible study was started, and the householders have been very attentive. The physical health of the woman improved too, and she can again go about her household duties. The man has regained his faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A sister living at a recreation center started a conversation with a woman who spent her vacation there. The woman manifested interest in the truth, and they met four times at the same place for back-calls. When the day of her departure came, a farewell dancing party was given at the restaurant where she had her meals, but the woman preferred to spend that evening with the sister and her husband, who comes home only on weekends. She wanted to learn more about God’s Word and purpose. When the vacationer had to depart, all three of them had tears in their eyes. The brother was able to make arrangements with some publishers living in the neighborhood of the woman to look after her. But one week later a letter arrived from the woman inquiring about the promised visit by the other publisher. When the new publisher called, he was warmly welcomed. A regular Bible study was started. Some time later the publishers at the recreation center learned that the woman’s husband, who had planned on leaving his wife, joined the study and became reconciled to her. Both of them are now happily looking forward to being immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The work has gone ahead peacefully throughout the service year in Ethiopia. There has been no further difficulty in Addis Ababa, and the brothers continue to hold their congregation meetings without hindrance. They, together with their brothers in other parts of the country, continue to be supplied with all the new publications in English. Also, now the brothers are supplied with study material in their own language, and this has made possible study at home, which will make for greater participation at the meetings and more growth to maturity on the part of the brothers and sisters who have little or no knowledge of English. Further, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> Kingdom Ministry School Course was arranged, which was participated in keenly by the servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The big waves of persecution and opposition that struck our brothers in Eritrea during the past years have become news of the past. The problems such as taking a loyalty oath and the employment issue that have befallen our brothers have required real faithfulness on their part. But by not neglecting the house of our heavenly Father they were able to keep up their courage and faith and were able to carry on with the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Due to persistent preaching and the conducting of many home Bible studies by our brothers, the minds of the people interested in the truth and even some of our former enemies of the church have been aroused to understand the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses, and many have taken their stand for God’s kingdom. In fact, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> priest who traveled from far villages came in contact with a brother and a sister and asked if they knew the place of gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses and their beliefs, as he was very misinformed about our faith. The sister took him to her house and immediately her brother started a Bible study with him for a few days. He soon grasped the truth and went back to his village, where contact with him was broken for a time. Then he unexpectedly came back again, contacted the brother and urged him to teach his son all the truths that he had studied. To this end he also invited the brother to his village to teach two other priests who were completely confused about the church’s beliefs and who disliked the disagreements of the religious leaders of their church. Does not this experience seem amazing? Our former enemies who once publicly excommunicated us are coming to a knowledge of the truth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HUNGARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers in Hungary have had fewer difficulties than in previous years. The work has to be done underground, but Jehovah’s witnesses are known throughout the whole land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How the truth can change a person’s life is shown by the following experience: A publisher made a call upon an elderly woman, and the subject of the coming earth-wide paradise was discussed. During the conversation the woman remarked that she suffers a lot on account of her husband, a man given to excessive drinking, swearing and squandering his money to satisfy his passions. A little while later the husband came home, and the publisher, a sister, kindly started a conversation with him and, to her surprise, he agreed to study the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font9"> book in his home. The wife of this man then went on a visit for two weeks with her children, and in the meantime four study lessons were held with the man. When his wife returned, she noticed a change in him. He had completely stopped swearing. The study was continued and the man stopped his excessive drinking and card playing. This case aroused great admiration in the village, because as a former police officer the man was well known in the community and it was also generally known that he formerly had a hostile attitude toward Jehovah’s witnesses. Both he and his wife now attend the meetings and they intend to get immersed at the next opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A woman went up to a man in the city and asked: “Which bus must I take to get to ----?” She continued:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I would like to go there because I have heard that some of Jehovah’s witnesses are there.” The man was surprised and asked the name of the person she intended to visit. “I don’t know anybody there,” she replied. “I only can tell you that I am looking for Jehovah’s witnesses.” The man answered that he was traveling to that place himself and that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The woman was very pleased and on the way to the village she told him “her story.” She is the mother of two children who had left Hungary for England and who came in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses there. “When I heard about this,” she said, “I became very angry that the Catholic religion should not be good enough for my children anymore, and I immediately decided to make a trip to England in order to advise my children to stop learning about this new religion. I made the trip to England, but I was not able to influence my children. To the contrary, they talked to me about their new faith and they told me so many wonderful things that I simply could not maintain my opposition. Then I recognized what a great privilege it is to serve Jehovah. When I came home again I did not attend church anymore. Since I had been a devout Catholic, this, of course, was noticed. When the priest came to see me and asked why I had stopped attending the church services, I replied with the Bible text that says that one should not make images and worship before them and that I did not want to be an idol worshiper.” Since that time many persons have taken a hostile attitude toward her. But she is glad that her husband is not against the truth. A Bible study is being conducted with her now, and she has many opportunities to witness for the truth. Her children in England intend to get baptized on the occasion of the next circuit assembly, and this woman in Hungary has the desire to be baptized and be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Here, as in many other cases, the opposition to the truth came out of an ignorant but honest heart and was overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">POLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness our brothers in Poland have weathered a vicious storm that rocked the very foundation of their Christian unity and spiritual cleanness. A responsible servant left the high standard of Christian morality. But instead of owning up to his error, he tried to cover it up and mislead his brothers who wanted to clarify the matter. The authorities made use of that situation in order to pursue their own wicked aims. They started to play many tricks upon the publishers in order to bewilder them and undermine their faith and trust in the theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Mimeographed pamphlets originating with the authorities were distributed to the publishers in great numbers, seemingly backing those who tried to rectify the matter, but in reality calculated to be a stab in their backs. Hundreds of faked private letters supposedly written from friends abroad upon the direction of the Society were mailed by the authorities to publishers in the country, claiming that there was nothing to the accusations against that man and that the Society would back him and saying that the publishers should continue to respect him. Genuine letters written from friends abroad were intercepted by the authorities and their contents carefully changed along the same lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The unfaithful man and a few of his fellow workers went along in that attempt made by the authorities. Thus widespread confusion was caused in the minds of many brothers. The enemy seemed almost to have reached his goal, a split clear through Jehovah’s people in the country, attaching uncleanness to part of them and having them infested with the worldly spirit of disunity and distrust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But Jehovah’s spirit was more powerful than those clever machinations of men. Due to the local circumstances prevailing under the ban, it took some time to check all the contradictory reports so that no injustice might be done to anyone. But finally the evidence was established beyond any doubt, and the formerly responsible man was disfellowshiped and other faithful brothers shouldered the responsibility. The publishers in general showed a fine spirit of patience, cooperation and confidence in Jehovah and his ways of handling such a perplexing thing. They did not run ahead to make their own decisions nor let themselves be sidetracked or discouraged by the intrigues of the authorities, but faithfully minded their own business of carrying on their God-given assignment of preaching the good news and helping other people to become his dedicated witnesses, and they were greatly blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers received some unexpected assistance in their preaching work. The Catholic church published a fine, brand-new Bible translation, the so-called “Millennium Bible,” a modern version using God’s name Jahwe and leaving the Hebrew word </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font9"> untranslated. They are now able to prove clearly to the people from their own copies of the Bible important teachings about God’s name and the condition of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When a sister made a back-call on an elderly woman, her grandson, a Catholic priest, was present. He admitted that God’s name was Jehovah, but when cornered by the sister, he cried out: “You people disturb the pastoral peace.” He told his grandmother not to read our literature. Later on, the sister made another call. The woman told her that she again asked her grandson whether she should really turn the Witnesses away from the door. He became very thoughtful and started to weep. He regretted that a simple woman knew more about the contents of the Bible than did he. He encouraged his grandmother to read the Holy Scriptures and the literature given her by the publisher. She is now enjoying a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Silent sermons can be very effective. A sister was very badly treated by her husband because she had accepted the truth. He beat her up and once even threw her Bible out of the window. She bore all of it patiently, and her neighbors respected her for her fine conduct. When the sister bought herself a new Bible, she wrapped it up in a small parcel and asked her neighbor to keep it for her. Her neighbor agreed, but in her inquisitiveness she secretly opened the parcel and started to read in the Bible. After some time she confessed to the sister and began to ask her many questions. Three months later the sister’s neighbor, a woman sixty years of age, started out to preach to others herself. She became a zealous publisher, spending twenty-five hours in the field per month. One of her daughters has already taken up the preaching work and is ready to symbolize her dedication by water baptism. Thus the conduct of the humble, patient sister without a word was the initial witness that helped those two women to become fellow praisers of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMANIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah’s witnesses in Romania suffer under the totalitarian rule in power there. They have no freedom to preach at all. But they do not postpone the preaching of the good news, awaiting more favorable conditions to come. They do the best they can under the adverse circumstances. And they have done a very good work and their ranks have increased in numbers. They endure with optimism and joy with Jehovah’s help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Send out your bread upon the surface of the waters, for in the course of many days you will find it again.” (Eccl. 11:1) Truly, many days pass in some instances until the seed of truth, sown in a good heart, springs up and bears fruit. This was the case with a preacher of the Pentecostal Church. About six or seven years ago two witnesses of Jehovah spoke to this minister and tried to help him see the error of his religion and also find the true faith, which is based on God’s Word. But the preacher was not prepared to accept this message, being deeply rooted in his faith, even speaking in tongues. Surprisingly, one of the publishers who spoke to him at that time had a telephone call recently from this Pentecostal preacher asking the brother to come to his home in order to discuss once again the subject of true religion. He wanted to know more about the strong faith of Jehovah’s witnesses. The two brothers who had sown the first seed several years before then went to see him and answered his questions. He now saw the big difference between the Pentecostal faith and the truth and he expressed his ardent desire to become one of God’s people. His wife agreed with him and, after a study of the elementary doctrines of God’s Word, both persons were immersed. Indeed, the seed sown many years ago had been kept alive in the soil of a good heart. So, even if our preaching does not bear results immediately, we never know if it will bear results many days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TURKEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who would like to escape the coming destruction of Babylon the Great, the empire of false religion, have to get out of it. Some friends, when coming into the truth, used this opportunity to write to their former churches or synagogues explaining the reason why they had become Jehovah’s witnesses and saying that they therefore wanted their names to be removed from the membership rolls. This, of course, caused some disturbance among the clergy and priests. Some friends were invited before a committee where they gave a good witness for the Kingdom. The clergy are now afraid they will lose out among their parishioners. For this reason the Greek Orthodox Church, the Gregorian Church (church of the Armenians) and the Roman Catholic Church have determined to join together in order to prevent more of their parishioners from learning the truth of God’s kingdom. Through their newspapers they have several times misrepresented Jehovah’s witnesses and have called them ignorant and unlearned people who do not understand the Bible. Some of their priests even visited some of the sheeplike persons who are studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses and threatened them. They announced that these Bible students would be excommunicated, which means, among other things, that their dead would not be buried from the churches. Since most of the cemeteries are owned by a church or synagogue, they expect that people will be afraid of having no place to bury their dead and therefore will quit studying the Bible. However, the majority continue to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That, not the clergy but, rather, Jehovah’s witnesses are doing the work Jesus did and commanded in lovingly taking care of the people can be seen from this interesting experience. A brother writes: “After our being rejected at one door, on our leaving the house an elderly lady approached us and asked for a certain shop. The sister kindly showed the way. Then I said to the sister: ‘Now after having helped her to find the way to the shop, why not help her to find the more important way of everlasting life?’ So the sister started to witness to the lady in the Greek language. The lady was overjoyed to hear about the real hope based upon the Bible for the first time in her life. When the sister asked for her address in order to help her to learn more about the Bible, the lady answered a little bit ashamed: ‘I am sorry, I cannot invite you, because I have no money to give you for your help; I am poor.’ At once the sister explained to her the Biblical principles and referred to Jesus’ words in Matthew 10:8: ‘You received free, give free.’ The lady was very happy to learn this and said: ‘If this is so, then please come and see me. I hesitated because when our priests come they always expect money for their service.’ (She belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church.) Immediately the address was noted and an appointment was made.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How important it is always to be alert and to use every opportunity for witnessing can be seen from another experience. A lady came to see a brother who is an optician in order to buy new eyeglasses. In order to determine whether the glasses were suitable the brother referred her to the reading board. However, the lady rejected this, saying: “I would like to read from a book that I read every day.” So she brought a Bible out of her bag. The brother commended her for reading this book and turned to Revelation 21:4. After she read this scripture he gave some explanation and then turned to Psalm 37:10, 11. Again after her reading he explained the meaning of it and opened her Bible to John 17:3, and in this way he gave the current sermon. Then he asked her how she could see with her new glasses. She answered: “Very fine. However, I am surprised how well you know the Bible. I have never read such fine verses and never heard such excellent explanations.” So the brother continued witnessing to her and arranged to have his mother-in-law study with this lady. She is now progressing very quickly and is happy, too, that she now can see with her spiritual eyes also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The past service year has been one of great joy to the brothers. All those who years ago had been deported to Siberia on account of the truth and who were restricted from moving to some other region have been freed and were permitted to go to any place they liked within the country. Many of them returned home after long years of absence. They were warmly welcomed by their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The trend to a more tolerant attitude on the part of the authorities, which has been noticeable for the past few years, has continued to become more manifest. There have again been no new arrests or searchings of homes during the past year. Some of the atheistpropaganda lecturers even went as far as saying that the literature of the Society is of purely religious content, a thing they never admitted before, as they had always falsely accused our literature of serving political aims. A professor in a city in western Russia recently gave a lecture about atheism to technical students. In it he also referred to Jehovah’s witnesses. He said there is no use trying to convert them. He also mentioned that their refusal of military service does not make them enemies of the State in any country. All of this change for the better after long years of stern measures of suppression against the brothers has been greatly appreciated by them, because it is their desire to carry on their Christian lives and work in a quiet, mild and peaceful manner, as far as it depends on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The name Siberia, in fact, has lost its terror for our brothers and to many it has become a cherished territory assignment. A sister who as a young girl had been deported to Siberia with her family was given the permission to return home to western Russia with her parents, but she only stayed there for a short while. She had learned to love the humble and hospitable people out there so much that she left her family and voluntarily returned to Siberia to continue preaching to those more receptive people there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Years ago the brothers heard their persecutors say: ‘‘We have a vast area in Siberia and it is very cold there. Give them twenty-five-year terms to serve there and their work will freeze.” For an atheist’s mind there is no reproduction in severe cold according to the law of nature, but due to Jehovah’s enlivening spirit his witnesses increased. “I myself am one who learned the truth out there in the bitter cold of a penal camp,” one brother related. Having been born in Russia in a German settlement, he was filled with worldly ideals and joined Hitler’s special SS troops when the German army moved in during World War II. He became a prisoner of war and was shipped to the United States, only to be handed over to the Russians at the end of the war. They sentenced him to twenty-five years of hard labor in Siberia for his activity with the German army. Now he is happy that he went through all that trouble and disappointment, because he came to develop a strong desire for the truth, and he took hold of it when he came in contact with the brothers in the penal camp, heard the message and observed their exemplary conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A message from such a penal camp where brothers are still serving their prison terms reached us, showing that they continue to use their opportunities: “Now worldly people have been put with us in our cells, and some brothers were transferred by the administration to cells with worldly people into which we formerly were never permitted to come. The spiritual work is now running along at full speed. Although these people are very debased, there are some among them who hear, even though they are few. Jehovah is aiding us greatly by means of the spiritual food.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The brothers throughout the country try many different ways in order to find people who will listen to the message. They cannot go from door to door, neither do they have any literature available for the public. But you may pretend that you are looking for some property to buy, inquiring about it of the owner or his neighbors. The discussion will soon switch over to a Kingdom theme. Or you may look for people who possess a Bible, asking them whether they would sell it to you. The people then often wonder why you are so much interested in that “old book.” Then it is your turn to explain the true value of it. When you finally leave, the Bible may perhaps no longer be had from them, but they will start reading it and studying the truth themselves. Or you may go to a cemetery where there is a funeral. You start asking some questions as to why people die, whether there will be a resurrection, whether there may be some people who will not have to die at all. Very likely you will soon have a lively discussion about the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus, a brother just passing through the entrance into a cemetery heard one Ukrainian man say to his fellow: “Through this gate all will have to pass.” The brother took the opportunity and at once replied: “Have you ever heard that there are some people living today who will not have to pass through that gate?” An interesting conversation resulted, and those strangers got to hear the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some time ago a Communist youth leader was assigned to turn young people away from religion to atheism. He tried to persuade a young sister to become an atheist. In order to better refute her arguments, he started studying the truth himself. In the course of his studies he began to look at things differently. He also developed some personal interest in the sister. Then she was arrested for preaching the good news and sent to prison for three years. This occurrence impressed the youth leader so much that he made his decision. He expressed his desire to marry the sister and promised to wait until she would be free again. Meanwhile, he has come into the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">UNITED ARAB REPUBLIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">An unbelieving, opposing husband who had fiercely beaten his wife and driven her away from his house because of the truth decided, after all that, to be reconciled to her. After her refusal, he decided to take revenge on her and on all the Witnesses he knew. Therefore he went to the police station and charged his wife with being a Zionist and an immoral woman who went out with many men and was loose in her conduct. He even gave many names and addresses of brothers and sisters he knew, adding that they hold illegal Jewish meetings. On hearing that, the police officer to whom he complained was very puzzled, because his wife was studying also with the Witnesses, and he had already heard similar charges against Jehovah’s witnesses from some of his relatives to whom his wife happened to preach. So he sent several secret policemen to all the addresses given to him in order for them to watch the Witnesses’ activities and movements closely for nine successive weeks. He even assigned someone to watch his wife’s movements. He thus found out she was attending congregational studies and was preaching without ever telling him. From his detailed investigations he was convinced that Jehovah’s witnesses are peaceful and very moral persons interested only in studying and preaching God’s Word. After his investigations were over, he confessed to his wife about them and even encouraged her to continue studying with Jehovah’s witnesses as they are good people. He also advised the opposing husband that he could not take any measures against them, because they do not do what he claimed. When the opposing husband saw that the officer did not do anything against them and his wife, he went to the officer’s superior. The superior ordered the first one to reopen the investigations. The officer, to show his obedience, took the opposing husband in a police car and they went around together to all these addresses. Then the officer convinced his superior about the lies of the opposing husband; so the superior officer let the brothers continue unhindered with their pure and undefiled worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A circuit servant reported: ‘When I started my visit to a large congregation, the friends informed me that an organization of Orthodox, Catholics, and Protestants was just established in order to fight our work. When I asked the brothers whether they knew any of the leaders of the organisation and was answered affirmatively, I decided to visit them, one by one, accompanied by different local brothers, applying in this case the principle that the best defence is to take the offence. Here are a few of the outstanding results from this campaign:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The first one we visited was a druggist, and he was very much astonished that we paid him a visit at his home. When he heard our point of view, he sincerely admitted he did not know both sides of the issue and that he had joined this organisation that opposes us thinking he was rendering a ‘sacred service’ to God. However, he was not very pleased with the insulting, violent style the priests are using against us. During our second visit we started a Bible study in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font9"> book, and he is now progressing very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The second one among the leaders of this organisation happened to be a smith. After hearing the Kingdom message and thinking we were members of his church, he said, showing his wrist: ‘I am waiting to see one of Jehovah’s witnesses in order to beat him!’ The brother (a circuit servant) told him that he had the opportunity to see, not just one of Jehovah’s witnesses, but two, standing right then in front of him. When the householder heard this statement, he blushed and insisted we enter his home to explain the Bible further. He was very enthusiastic about what he heard, and after a while he said: ‘Do you know that you are very much hated and persecuted?’ We said, ‘Yes.’ Then he asked again: ‘Aren’t you afraid?’ We replied that, our work being divine, we are protected by angels. If we take into consideration the fact that a single angel struck down 185,000 Assyrians in one night, we can understand how much God protects us! At the end of the discussion he added: ‘You are not the ones that should be persecuted, but those that speak abusively of you. I must avenge you!’ On this point we kindly interrupted him and explained that vengeance belongs to Jehovah. Thus we started a second study with another fierce opposer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Reading many of the experiences that our brothers have had throughout the world in their ministry certainly makes our hearts glad and causes us to rejoice. While in the minds of some it may be felt that the work is slowing down, this certainly is not the case. The urgency of declaring the good news is greater today than ever before. The nearer we come to the battle of Armageddon the stronger we should feel the responsibility to declare God’s message for these “last days.” Jehovah’s witnesses have done a fine work during the 1966 service year and have good reason to rejoice. They have declared the good news in 199 different lands, two more than in 1965, which, of course, includes the great nations of the earth, the colonies and the principal isles of the sea. This great witness work was carried on under the direction of 95 branch offices, which include three new branch offices established during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While not as many persons were baptized this year as during the former five or six years, when the figure was well up in the 60,000 bracket, still 58,904 persons were baptized, symbolizing their dedication to God and permanent entrance into the ministry. This is excellent, and we rejoice with these new ones who have taken a stand for Jehovah and his kingdom. Perhaps year by year there will be fewer and fewer coming into the organization. But should we not, as we come nearer the end of the harvest, expect the ingathering to be smaller? In 1964 there were over 68,000 baptized; in 1965, 64,000, and now in 1966, 58,000. Maybe this will continue to drop year by year, but, on the other hand, maybe because of the urgency of the times and the extraordinary effort put forth by Jehovah’s witnesses 1967 will see a greater number of persons withdrawing from the Devil’s organization and taking their stand on Jehovah’s side. The results will depend on what we are going to do in our daily service in all parts of the world throughout the whole year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While the total hours were a bit below last year’s total, still the 170,664,897 hours spent in the preaching work means that a tremendous witness was given. The back-calls improved in the total number made. There was an increased distribution of bound books. Booklet placements were good and magazines were only two million below last year’s distribution. Subscriptions received dropped a little, but the overall distribution of literature was fine. The printing plants of the Society around the world were kept more than busy producing your needs. In New York city at the headquarters of the Society we are now erecting a new ten-story building because we feel the pressure of the work and the demand for more publications. We are constantly increasing the number of members in the Bethel family. We need more workers at the Brooklyn Bethel home. We need more workers in the missionary field world wide, and it is certainly fine to see the young people making a definite decision to get out into the pioneer and missionary work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What a joy it is, too, to know that 8,349 individuals, dedicated men and women, have devoted their time to the missionary and special pioneer work throughout the earth. Still in the full-time service are 2,103 graduates of Gilead working in 121 countries. Along with them, on the average, there were 38,743 regular and vacation pioneers, and at one time during the year the vacation pioneers pushed the total up to 92,155. What a grand witness is being given by all the fulltime preachers! Among these full-time servants are 2,077 circuit and district servants working day in and day out, devoting themselves to the congregations of God, which now number 24,910. As the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font9"> shows, these overseers have done a great work in helping many of the delinquent publishers to get themselves back into the joy of true worship. They have shown them the importance of attending meetings and not neglecting the house of their God. They have called on those who have drifted completely away from God’s organization for years and have revitalized some. While this is part of their treasure of service, still their big work is going from house to house, along with all the publishers of the Kingdom, finding those who are sighing and crying because of the abominations that exist in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In order to take care of all the missionaries and special pioneers the Society spent $3,422,574.21 during the twelve months of the past service year. To keep the circuit and district servants visiting the congregations around the world we spent $682,282.68. In addition to this expense, our brothers have housed and fed all the circuit and district servants. How kind of them! So for the expansion of the Kingdom work, and to help these publishers stay in the work and carry out their responsibilities, the Society has spent $4,104,856.89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to all these full-time workers, we have 1,591 brothers and sisters working in Bethel homes around the world in 95 branches. This is grand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are very grateful to all the brothers world wide for their contributions. They have made it possible to advance the interests of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth. Additionally, other contributions have made it possible for us to build new branch offices and produce new literature and get out films and other things that will greatly aid people in getting an understanding of the Bible. Thank you so much. We are grateful for all this assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So we have good reason to rejoice. Even though the report shows only a 2.4-percent increase for the entire world, still in many countries we have had a better-than-ten-percent increase. Some increases in larger countries have been as high as 27 percent. In each and every one of the countries in which we live individually, we should want to bring about the increase of disciples of Jehovah God who will walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Remember, Isaiah had to work right down to the end of his life, preaching his message. He did not see that stiff-necked Israelite nation turning its heart to Jehovah. Nevertheless, he kept right on preaching. Today, we are seeing some results from our labors and some people are turning around and following Christ Jesus. We certainly want to help all the people we possibly can to do this. Let us be sure, though, that we make good disciples out of the men and women that we do teach. Let us not see our building work go up in smoke because we were building with wood, hay and stubble. But, rather, let us be sure that all the people to whom we bring a knowledge of the truth and whom we teach the Word of God grow to maturity and become strong so as to survive the heat of the day and the battle of Armageddon, to travel on into God’s new order of things where they will receive life everlasting as sons of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What a pleasure it has been for all of us to work together in unity, praising Jehovah God and carrying on true worship! What a pleasure it has been to come together at our Kingdom Halls and not neglect the house of our God! What a joy it has been for all of the anointed remnant to see the “other sheep” associated with them in this glorious work! While there were only 11,179 individuals who declared that they were of the anointed class, still at the Memorial celebration held on April 5, 1966, there were 1,971,107 in attendance, 38,018 more than during the previous year. What happiness was manifested by the “other sheep” at this gathering!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">People are still fleeing from Babylon the Great and coming to Jehovah’s organization. Let us help them in their flight. Let us give them spiritual food and protection within Jehovah’s organization. Now, as we are entering into a new calendar year, 1967, let us one and all appreciate the urgency of the times and work together in declaring the good news of God’s kingdom everywhere and make it another glorious year of service to the honor and glory and praise of our Father in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In all the letters that I received from the branch servants around the world, they asked that I convey to every one of Jehovah’s witnesses around the world their warm love and best wishes. They are interested in all of you and want to express their appreciation for your goodness to them in making it possible for them to have branch offices, missionary homes, special pioneers and literature in so many languages, so that they can carry on in their territories preaching the good news of reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Daily I pray to our Father in heaven that his blessing and favor may attend all of you, and, along with our brothers everywhere, I send my warm love and greetings too. May this year prove to be a year of great blessing in gathering and caring for God’s “sheep,” as we say together, “Here I am! Send me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&gt; President</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Annual Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pursuant to the law and the provisions of the Society’s charter, the annual meeting of the members of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was held at its registered office, 4100 Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, at ten o’clock in the morning on Saturday, October 1, 1966. This proved to be a very unusual meeting in that the local congregations, the Bellevue Unit, Homewood Unit, McKeesport Unit and South Hills Unit were tied together by direct telephone with the main auditorium. In these five Kingdom Halls there was a total attendance of 2,977 at the annual meeting. The president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, presided at the meeting and called on K. F. Klein to open the assembly with prayer. Brother V. C. Wisegarver gave brief comments on the daily text and read the portion from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font9"> Then the secretary, Brother Suiter, presented information to show that 402 members of the Pennsylvania corporation were present personally or by proxy. The membership roll on October 1, 1965, was 435. During the year sixteen members of the Pennsylvania corporation passed away in death, leaving a membership enrollment on October 1, 1966, of 419. So with the 402 present in person or by proxy we were able to go ahead with the annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The three directors whose terms were expiring were reelected for a period of three years, namely, M. G. Henschel, N. H. Knorr and L. A. Swingle. The secretary of the Society then gave greetings from many members who were unable to attend and also some experiences were read from letters. Following this the president of the Society proceeded with the delivery of a discourse on the subject “No Healing Till Houses Are Without Man.” This very interesting material appears in the December 15, 1966, issue of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A few days later, in New York city, on October 6, 1966, all the members of the Board of Directors met in the office of the president so that officers could be elected for the next year. The directors present, of which there are seven, were: N. H. Knorr, F. W. Franz, </span><span class="font6">321</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Grant Suiter, T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle, J. O. Groh and M. G. Henschel. The following individuals were elected unanimously to the following positions: President, N. H. Knorr; Vice-President, F. W. Franz; Secretary and Treasurer, Grant Suiter; Assistant Secretary and Treasurer, J. O. Groh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The president then read a statement of receipts and disbursements for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for the service year ending August 31, 1966, and the statement of condition of the Society. By unanimous vote the report was accepted as read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A brief report was given concerning the expansion of the branch facilities and the progress of the field ministry throughout the world. All the members expressed their appreciation for their grand privileges of service, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they are determined to go ahead during the ensuing year working solely in the interests of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">OF NEW YORK, INC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The annual meeting of this Society was held on January 8, 1966, at Brooklyn, New York, the headquarters of the Society. The directors and officers of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., are N. H. Knorr, President; F. W. Franz, VicePresident; Grant Suiter, Secretary and Treasurer; J. O. Groh, Assistant Secretary and Treasurer; Directors, G. M. Couch, M. H. Larson and L. K. Greenlees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Here I am! Send me.”—Isa. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Millions of people have said: “Here I am! Send me.” But how many of these millions of people have really meant it? How many were willing to be disciples of Jesus Christ and stand up under the trials, persecutions and difficulties that had to be faced by true followers? How many appreciated the full meaning of what it meant to be sent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the case of Isaiah, he was sent by God to preach a message to the delinquent Israelites, and he was to make them hear again and again, but even though he spoke to them again and again with God’s message they did not want to understand. They kept their ears shut. They kept their eyes closed. In fact, the Bible tells us they pasted their very eyes together so that they might not see. At one time they had been God’s chosen people, but they did not want to be His people any longer, and even though Jehovah sent the prophet Isaiah to them to help them they did not want help so as to understand and they did not want to be actually turned back to get healing for themselves from Jehovah. What a condition of mind to be in!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are people like that today who claim to be in Jehovah’s organization. However, Jehovah’s faithful overseers of the Watch Tower Society and the circuit servants, district servants and congregation overseers have been trying to help everyone who has dedicated his life to God’s service to appreciate his responsibility and privilege of carrying on in true worship. Many delinquent and weak ones have heard and have returned to associate with God’s spiritual temple class after being made conscious of their spiritual needs 323</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">again. Now they are pressing on day by day in the study of God’s Word and in the ministry. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font10"> tells us the joy of service many of them are now having.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the other hand, there are others who, like those in Christendom, prefer not to be identified in any way with Jehovah’s witnesses. They, rather, choose the old dying system of things, its way of life, its immorality, its materialism and its easy-going “I do not care what happens” attitude. They have made up their minds that they will not turn back so as to get healing for themselves. But Jehovah’s witnesses, in their love and desire to help, will continue returning to them like Isaiah. Just how long will these people keep their eyes shut and their ears stopped up and their hearts unreceptive? It will be until the cities actually crash in ruins to be without an inhabitant and the houses without earthly man and the ground itself is ruined in desolation. That is being stubborn! That is how long they will not listen. It is hard to believe that some dedicated Christians who turned back to the world will be just like Christendom who will not turn back to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How very necessary it is, then, for each one of Jehovah’s witnesses to do as Isaiah did, observe the situation, see it clearly, and say to Jehovah: “Here I am! Send me! I will do the work. I will preach, I will keep talking and will try to make disciples just as long as you direct that this work should be done.” This is the spirit that will prove pleasing to Jehovah and this is the spirit that will bring the individual in line for everlasting life. Why not be like Isaiah, and say: “Here I am! Send me,” and mean it? Give your heart, mind, soul and strength to Jehovah and the doing of his will. Doing so will prove you love Jehovah God and your brothers.</span></p>
