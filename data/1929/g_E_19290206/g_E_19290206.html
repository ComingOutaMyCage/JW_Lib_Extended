<p><span class="font16">The City of New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font13">T THE mouth of a great river, and built mainly on three islands, the city of New</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">York has unusual water trading facilities. Its harbor is one of the finest in the world. One hundred fifty miles of its waterfront are occupied by docks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The bedrock of Manhattan Island, known to geologists as the Manhattan schist, is one of the oldest rocks of the North American continent, and is well suited to bear the weight of the giant skyscrapers which have made New York city the Babylon of the Twentieth Century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Most of the city lies to the east of the Hudson River; but Staten Island is on its western shore, or rather on the southern shore of the harbor into which the Hudson flows. East River, which is merely a strait between the harbor and Long Island Sound, cuts the city in half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Elaborate plans for the filling up of the East River have often been promulgated, but it is doubtful if the War Department would permit it to be done. At present it is crossed by five wonderful bridges and four pairs of tunnels, with another pair now in construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“Little Old New 'York” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Little Old New York,” as it is sometimes called, is not so very little and not so very old. Damascus, built by the great-grandson of Noah, is about 4,000 years old and was a city in Abra-' ham's time. Jerusalem (Jebus Salem) was also a city in Abraham’s time. Rome is 2,670 years old; London, 1,950; Paris, 1,560; Berlin, 620; New York, 310.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Giovanni da Verrazano, an Italian, and Diego Gomez, a Portuguese, entered New York harbor in 1524, seeking a new way to the East Indies. Eighty-five years later, in April, 1609, Henry Hudson, an Englishman, employed by the Dutch East Indies Company, sailed up the Hudson to Albany; and his stories of what he saw led to the colonization of Manhattan Island in 1623.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of the thirty families which came in 1623, only a few settled on Manhattan Island. Peter Minuit, the first governor, was not installed in office until 1626, at which time he purchased Manhattan Island from the Indians for the modest sum of $24, considerably less than some individuals now’ pay for a single meal on the same site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">While the first thirty families came under the protection of the Dutch East Indies Company, they were mostly Walloons from one of the provinces of Belgium. Many of the Flemish and Walloon colonists of New York were domiciled in Holland before they came to America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Always liberty lovers, and defenders of freedom of speech and of the press, the Dutch founders of New Amsterdam made it a haven for colonists of every faith, Waldenses, Huguenots, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Moravians, Anabaptists and Jew<sup>r</sup>s. By 1650 eighteen languages were spoken in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On the ground that the entire continent of America belonged to them by right of Cabot’s discoveries, the British seized New Amsterdam in 1664, and renamed the city New York; and although the city remained Dutch in language, customs and feeling for half a century, it finally became what it is today, the English-speaking metropolis of the Western world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Some words of Dutch Qrigin still survive in New York city and throughout America: boss, boom, boodle, sled, skate, stove, yacht and stoop. The words cookie, spook and hookey are also of Dutch origin. The Schenck-Crook house in Flatlands, still standing, was built before the English seized the city. The Van Pelt manor house in New .Utrecht, at 80th Street and 19th</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Avenue, If Weved to have been built the year the government changed hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Influences of Bolland Still Scon</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Always in danger of floods in their home country, the natives of the Netherlands, accustomed to build the main floor of their homes several feet above the ground, followed that habit in New York. This accounts for the great number of brownstone fronts with high stoops still lingering in the midst of apartment houses, hotels, theaters and even skyscrapers, but more especially to be found on the more or less quiet side streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With the lapse of time the little village of Breukelen has become the great city of Brooklyn. Boswijk, transformed into Bushwick, has long since been absorbed by its greater neighbor. The districts of Flatlands, Flatbush and New Utrecht may still be located by the curious. Gowanus, a part of Brooklyn, was named after an Indian, Gowane. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New York makes no effort to preserve its landmarks. Every seventy-five years there is a complete new city, with here and there a very few fine old residences left over. The Dyckman house at Broadway and 204th Street, was erected in 1783; the Van Cortlandt mansion, in Van Cortlandt Park, in 1748; the Jumel mansion, in 1765; and the Schenck house, in Canarsie Park, was built in 1770. These are the principal old buildings remaining. At 421 East Sixty-first Street is an old colonial home, the country residence of an aid-de-camp to General Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Slaves were brought into New York almost with the first settlers. In the year 1746 twenty percent of the population of the city were slaves. In 1741 the charges of a depraved and abandoned girl led to a panic in which four white men were condemned and put to death, fourteen negroes were burned at the stake, eighteen were hanged and seventy-one were exfled. This led to a revulsion of feeling in favor of. the negroes; and in 1758 slavery was abolished by the declaration that from that time forth all children born of slave parents should be free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New York has grown somewhat and has improved somewhat. In 1803 the north side of the marble-faced city hall was faced with red sandstone, because it was believed so few citizens would ever reside on that side of it. Seventy-five years ago New York had 10,000 vagrant children, now called bezprizorni in Russia; and fifty years ago it was not safe for a woman to appear on some of the streets after dark. Gambling, drunkenness and street fighting were common occurrences. It is bad enough even yet, but better than formerly.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>How Big Is New York?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Within the metropolitan and police unit of Greater London there is a population of 7,476,168 persons. This includes the territory within a radius of fifteen miles. Within the police unit of Greater New York there is a population of only 5,620,048. But the National Geographic Society claims that a Greater New York, modeled on the Greater London lines, taking in all suburban cities within a fifteenmile radius from the city center, with New Jersey towns included, would pass London’s population within a like area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The claim is further made regarding New York that it is the largest commuting city in the world; and that if the territory from which the commuters come to work is included, namely, the New York state counties of Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk, the Connecticut county of Fairfield, and the New Jersey counties of Monmouth, Middlesex, Somerset, Morris and Passaic, with all the intervening metropolitan districts, the total is ten millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Within the area last described live enough people to repopulate Canada to its present density, or to more than repopulate Australia, Austria, Belgium, Holland or Sweden. Or, the combined population of this area could repopulate to its present density the combined cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis and Boston. New York is big, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">too</span><span class="font13"> big.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the year 1653 New York had a population of 1,120. The records of the time show that there was a traffic problem, so many cattle, goats and hogs cluttering the thoroughfares that it was hard to get around. Now they tell us that in seventy more years New York will have a population of 29,000,000, and that is altogether too many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The heart of New York has grown so dense that the population is getting less. How is that? Every skyscraper that is built demolishes some buildings where human beings have been housed,Large areas have been cleared for bridge and tunnel approaches. Other buildings</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">' have been sliced off in street widenings. As a consequence, Manhattan Island, solidly built up in 1919, is now steadily but slowly decreasing in population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■What Do So Many People Do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The average New Yorker is secretive. He 'does not like to have you ask what he does for a livelihood. But Uncle Sam is not so squeamish • so we find that 863,000 people are employed in factories, 455,000 in clerical work, 442,000 in merchandising, 347,000 as servants, 272,000 in transportation, 212,000 in the building trades, 190,000 in the professions and 68,000 in public service, and that is all that any of us do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The assessed value of realty in New York city was, in 1920, $8,626,000,000, or far in excess ' of the total value of all farm buildings in the Union. On the face of it, that shows a wrong condition of things. No other city has so great a control of wealth, buys or sells so great a value of commodities, handles so large a volume of foreign commerce, or manufactures an equal value of commercial articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are more Jews in New York city than in any other entire nation in the world, and more than in the whole of Asia. There are more Irishmen than in Dublin, more Italians than in Genoa, and more Negroes than in any other city in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Every day the New York post office handles 12,000,000 to 20,000,000 letters and cards. Every day 350,000 pieces are misdirected, and 80,000 are without street address. Every year the undeliverable parcels bring $50,000 at auction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It requires the unremitting toil of half a million farmers to keep New Yorkers fed. Annually they consume 50,000 carloads of fresh fruits and vegetables; 1,000,000,000 pounds of meat; 640,000,000 pounds of butter, cheese and poultry ; 6,800,000 cases of eggs, and 1,400,000 quarts of milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At last accounts there were still 565 farms in Queens, 121 in Richmond, 55 in the Bronx, 54 in Brooklyn and 5 in Manhattan. A prize pumpkin for the White House table, a 185-pounder, was grown on Staten Island.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Skyscrapers and Winds</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">.New York is a place of skyscrapers and yinds, and the two together make an interesting combination. The development of the sky-sciaper was due to the immense demand for office room in the limited area and crooked streets of lower Manhattan. The value of the land per square foot is so great that only a very tall building can return a profitable income from the investment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Reckoned from the standpoint of floor space, the Equitable Building, at Broadway and Pine Street, New York, is at present the most spacious building in the world. It is of thirty-seven stories and reaches a height of 485 feet six inches above the sidewalk. Nearby is the Singer Building, of forty-one stories. Its tower attains an elevation of 612 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Woolworth Building, fifty-one stories, its tower reaching 792. feet, is, with the exception of the Eiffel Tower of Paris, the tallest structure in the world. When New York has a high wind, it is difficult to walk within a block of the building; and not infrequently persons of light weight and small stature have been lifted off their feet and hurled to the sidewalk when passing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Weather Bureau records show that New York is windier than Chicago, Buffalo, Duluth or Cleveland. Its average wind velocity for the year is around seventeen miles an hour, mostly from the northwest; and the gales which sweep its business canyons are sources of real danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Two of the windiest places in the city are the areas near the Whitehall Building, at the Battery, and the Municipal Building. It is sometimes necessary to stretch a rope along Battery Place from Greenwich Street to the steps of the Whitehall Building, so that pedestrians can cling to it and make their way to and from the building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is claimed by city employes that in front of the Municipal Building, when high winds have prevailed, they have seen the wind blow a taxicab to a standstill there. We do not vouch for this; but that is the way the story comes to us, and it may be true. Where winds are so high, there is constant danger that pedestrians will be blown in front of autos, or be blinded by the dust and unable to see their approach.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Broadway, Wall Street, Maiden Lane</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">New York’s most popular street, Broadway, sixteen miles long, and said to be the longest continuous street in any city in the world, was once the western border of civilization. The original settlement was far down on the lower East Side. Everything west of Broadway belonged to the king, and was called the King’s Farm. The Broad Way in front of his premises is a legacy of the long ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As the settlement grew and dangers of a raid from the Indians were in the minds of the settlers, they built a barricade of oak posts and heavy planks to keep intruders out. This barricade was called a wall, and the area in front of it at length came to be called Wall Street. We still have it with us; or, putting it the other way around, Wall Street still has the rest of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">North of Wall Street was a little stream running down to the river. The maidens of those early days used to like to go outside the barricade in the gloaming and wander down the bank of the little stream, listening to the things maidens have been listening to since the first pair walked together in the leafy bowers of Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The bank of the little stream where those colonial dames once w’alked, finally came to be Maiden Lane; and as streams have a habit of running in curves, the lines of the little stream may even yet be seen more or less faithfully in what was, until, recently, the center of the jewelry trade of America. Much of this jewelry trade has now moved uptown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1712 the slaves of New York city, many of them, met in an orchard near Maiden Lane and formed a wild plan to kill all the whites. They did kill a dozen men. In the reprisals which followed twenty-one Negroes were shot, hanged or burned at the stake. It was this experience which lay at the bottom of the so-called Great Negro Plot of 1741, already described elsewhere in this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Down in the financial center are still a dozen Streets named after British royalty: Nassau, William, Ann, etc. And around the edges of the world’s greatest financial center ten thousand caretakers still live in homes that are none too beautiful or comfortable. These spend their lives scrubbing floors, washing dishes, dusting desks, clearing sidewalks of snow, and in many other ways making their fellows comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Fora seaboard city, New York lies quite high. Fort Washington, on Manhattan, is 268 feet above the sea. Brooklyn’s highest elevation has an altitude of 210 feet. Todt Hill, on Staten Island, is the highest natural elevation along the Atlantic coast south of Maine. It is 430 feet high.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Greenwich Village</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Greenwich Village lies to the north of what was once the King’s Farm. In modern parlance, it is below Fourteenth Street, on the West Side. The streets are so crooked that at one place Tenth Street crosses Fourth Street at right angles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Greenwich Village, with its tea rooms, artists’ studios, Italian restaurants, and places where one may buy all kinds of curious wares from very fine people, was once considered one of : the best health resorts on Manhattan Island. It was originally founded by sturdy Dutch farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Within recent years real estate men have rediscovered Greenwich Village. They have noticed how near it is to every important part of the city, and how readily its old houses can be made over into charming apartments. Business is crowding it hard, but it still houses a vast army of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Columbia Heights is for Brooklyn what Greenwich Village is for New York. It is residential and yet is very central to all important places, more so than Greenwich Village itself. On the Heights the streets are laid out regularly, and the old buildings are among the finest in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Chinatown and the Bowery</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">The residents of what was once Chinatown claim that there is now less crime in that area than in any other area of equal population in the entire city. Nevertheless, the yap wagons still tour the districts, pointing out to awed tourists the horrors which they have conjured </span><span class="font12">up </span><span class="font13">in their own minds. The Chinese of New York city are now mostly prosperous business men, either operating hand laundries or managing what are conceded to be the cleanest and <sup>: </sup>best restaurants in the city. Chinatown has lost all its old inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Bowery is in much the same situation. Originally the Bouwerie Lane was the road to Governor Peter Stuyvesant’s great Bouwerie, or farm, occupying the heart of what is now the great East Side. For two centuries it was a place where anything might happen. Now it is, and has been for years, a staid business street, of order and of good repute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">East of the Bowery, in 1916, lived 542,061 persons; but in 1924 the number had fallen to 416,108, and now it is estimated to be about</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">300,000. As tenants move out, apartments are being renovated and new white porcelain bath tubs are changing the ghetto into a good place to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Hell’s Kitchen is the block of tenement houses on West Thirty-ninth Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues. A few years ago it was a recognized center of drunkenness and crime on the West Side, but is now quite orderly. It was in the New York stockyards district. Its bad actors were butchers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Harlem Black Belt has its center at One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street and Lenox Avenue. It is a well-built, handsome quarter of the city, some twenty-three blocks long, but of narrow width. This Negro city of 200,000 people is the Mecca of the Negro race, one of the few places in the world where the Negro has a fair chance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The City Government &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The city government of New York is in the hands of Tammany Hall; and that is all any New Yorkei’ would wish to know. The sewer scandal in Queens, where the ring has stolen some $30,000,000, and robbed many people of their homes, was a typical Tammany job. The man who engineered the transaction got only a year in prison, and probably will not serve half of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The municipal debt of New York city is now twice as large as the total interest-bearing debt of the United States government itself as recently as 1916. Its debt is proportionately much greater than that of any other American city of the first rank. Its streets and parks are dirty, only 2,710 miles of its 4,618 miles of streets are paved at all, and the way it handles its sewage problem is a disgrace to humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The water is excellent, coming all the way ~rom the Catskills; but a shortage is imminent. With a safe minimum yield of 1,100,000,000 gallons a day, New York is now using 850,000,000 gallons a day, with an annual rate of increase of 31,000,000 gallons a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As the principal port of entry of the United States, New York is let in for many expensive welcomes to illustrious Visitors, much to the de-ight of those who have the execution of the entertainment contracts. Lindbergh’s welcome cost the city $50,000. In ten years there have been 202 chances for the Mayor’s Committee on Receptions to Distinguished Guests to run up bills for Father Knickerbocker to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On the average bright day the clouds of smoke particles which hang over New York deprive the city of thirty-seven percent of its sunlight in the early morning and fourteen percent at high noon. At night the city makes up for it. In its twenty thousand odd electric signs there are nearly one and one-half million lamps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One of the most interesting lights in the city is the light in the torch of the Statue of Liberty. On the night that Judge Rutherford and his friends were sentenced to Atlanta for being Christians, it was considered significant that the lights in that statue were extinguished for the first time. It was feared that the Germans were about to bomb the city. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many odd laws are still on New York city’s statute books. Sleeping in the bathroom is a crime, and so is hopping a ride on the back of a truck. Hunters and trappers may not seek game in the parks; not even a reptile may be captured or hurt. Tents may not be pitched. Dueling is taboo, and so are even bean-shooters. Hazing, keeping slot-machines and throwing knives in vaudeville acts are also forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New York Transportation</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was the building of the Erie Canal that gave New York its great start. Now there is hardly anybody in New York who^knows there is such a thing. Canals in America have had their day, and it was a short one. America is in too much of a hurry to wait to move things around by water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Just now New York is particularly interested in bridges and tunnels, of which it has some of the finest in the world, with more under way. The distance between the piers of the great Hudson River Bridge will be 3,500 feet, about double the span of the great Philadelphia-Camden Bridge. Its cost will be around $50,000,000. It will be ready in 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Practically every avenue of New York city has street cars, several of them have elevated lines (built in 1880), and several have subway lines. Most of the lines run all night and are well patronized at all hours. Fifth Avenue is served with double-decked motor buses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although the tubes have drawn much traffic away from the ferries, the ferries continue to carry large numbers, and they have a monopoly of the river transit ’from the northern part of Manhattan. The ferry to St. George, Staten 1st land, four and five-eighths miles, is one of the. important ferries of the city.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The New York Park System</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">New York could have had some of the finest । parks in the world, for there is much of beauty ' about the great harbor and rivers; but misman- agement and lack of foresight have cut the peo-pie off from the waterfront at all but a few places, and the only way most of them can ever </span><span class="font4">77 </span><span class="font13">get to a breathing place is through miles of stifling subway tubes, and jammed in like sardines. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When Ramsay MacDonald and his family recently visited America, Miss MacDonald said that the thing which most impressed her about New York is its lack of trees and parks. Nevertheless, the city is not without some fine parks. Central Park, 843 acres, cost the city $15,000,000. Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 526 acres, has some really fine scenery. Forest Park, in - Queens, 536 acres, is a fine piece of natural woodland, all in a wild state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">. _ . Some of the so-called parks in New York city, Washington, Union and Madison Squares, were at one time potter’s fields and came into existence merely because some unfortunates, even in death, had no place to lie. The total park area of Greater New York is 7,819 acres, mostly in the newer parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">‘ What Is New York?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">~ .....New York is a city of strangers, one of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">^hardest cities in the world in which to get ac-</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">7 </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">quain</span><span class="font13">ted and make any real friends that are worth while. It is too big to be hospitable. Like a g rea i pulse, hundreds of thousands come into the city every, day and hundreds of thousands Ygq, - and an individual is lost to view in the shuffle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thu high finance of New York settles the fate of nal ion5. It is the lair of the Beast, in dead earnest. Its stores contain the best of all earth’s products. It gathers brains and talent from the ends of the earth; for it has the money to pay, and money talks in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New York is a foreign city, necessarily, because all the immigrant s land there and many of them stay there. There are only about 1,164,834 natives in the city; all the rest are foreigners or children of foreigners. It is a noisy city, said to be the noisiest of all, because the busiest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New York is a fine city to visit, and a poor place to live in. Two hundred thousand persons change their home bases May 1 and October 1 each year, and some of them move back to the quarters they left a year previous. A change of environment is not always a change for the better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New York has some of the finest hotels in the world, and some of the worst. In one of the lodging-houses on Hester Street there is a sign, “Gents will please remove their clothes before going to bed.” New York is not a place of homes: it is a place of kitchenettes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are people who admire New York. The view south from Park Avenue at Fiftieth Street is said to be like the nave of a great cathedral, the most impressive avenue of buildings in the world. The Woolworth Building, and scores of others, are monuments to the enterprise of man, beautiful in design and execution, unparalleled on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">New Yorkers ride to their work, and as a consequence are said by chiropodists to have the smallest and most poorly-shaped feet in the country; but no one can deny that they work when they arrive. New York city produces seventy-seven percent of the women’s clothing manufactured in America, eighty-live percent of the feathers and plumes, seventy-six percent of the fur goods, seventy-five percent of the hair work, seventy-one percent of the pocketbooks, purses and card cases, sixty-five percent of the artificial flowers and plants, sixty-two percent of the millinery and lace goods; and it has the finest print shop in the world, the plant of the International Bible Students Association, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">An Englishman who had. enjoyed New York <sub>r </sub>waxed eloquent in a goodbye published in the London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Nation:</span></p>

Goodbye, New York! I</span></p>

Now here is your future. “The time will come when the earth will stop spinning, and the moon will i crash down upon us.” So says Sir Oliver Lodge in a lecture that he gave in London recently on : “The Birth of the Moon”. It would be millions ' and billions of years yet, he assured them. The speed at which the earth rotates is gradually .....slowing down, owing to the friction of the tides, each day being a 240-millionth part of a second . longer than the day before, he says.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">. Now, dear reader, if you believe in the Bible’s being the inspired Word of God you will, as . Sir Oliver’s opinion will show, belong to the class called “stupid people”. Sir Oliver added, . “Even at the present day take that great poem, .j-Ahe first chapter of Genesis, and interpret it literally, as if it were a statement of fact. There ■was a sort of disturbance when science found out that the whole universe was not brought into existence in a great hurry, in a .....period of one hundred forty-four hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We are of the opinion that Mr. Lodge will require to dislodge a great many things from his mind ere he will be able to understand the very elementary truths as contained in the Scriptures, and there will be a bigger disturbance in scientists’ heads when they find that the period mentioned in the first chapter of Genesis is not one hundred forty-four hours, but is, in our opinion, a period of 42,000 years, each day mentioned being 7,000 years long. After God made man, he rested on the seventh day, and from the creation of man till this present year is recognized as 6056, proving that the seventh day is a period of 7,000 years and so were all the days of creation; but the shape of some people’s heads will require to be altered to allow of this simple truth to enter their brain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Tramp Hero on the Railway</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A man was walking from Manchester to Sheffield, alongside the railway. When near Hyde (Cheshire) he heard a boy’s screams coming from the metals [rails]. Scrambling down the embankment, he found that the boy had his foot fast in the rail and was struggling desperately to get it out. He tried to release the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">lad, but could not, and he unlaced his boot, but still the boy could not take his foot out. The man then searched along the line a bit for something with which to lever the boot clear. He could find nothing, and he hurried back to the boy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At that moment the man heard the whistle of an express train. There was no time to stop it, so he twisted the boy’s foot and pulled him flat by the rails. He then lay down by his side, a second before the train dashed over them. The boy, Herbert Knowles, of Mottram, near Hyde, fainted with pain and fear, and it was some time before he could be released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">He was a modest hero, the tramp, and would not give his name; but we take our hats off to this gentleman, who is honestly seeking for work, and who was walking a distance of forty miles in search for it. Quick-minded and cool, he saved the boy's life at grave personal risk. Greater and nobler deeds of heroism are done in every-day life than are done by an army of conscripted soldiers on a battle-field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Prayer Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The prayer book of the Church of England seems to be a terrible worry to the archbishops and bishops of that denomination. They have worried over it and quarreled over it like a lot of old fogies. Their interest is not in the Bible nor in preaching the truth contained therein; rather, they have torn the Bible out and have nothing left but the batters and the prayer book within. No wonder there is a famine today for the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Prayer Book Measure, 1928, drafted by the bishops in consequence of the rejection of last year’s proposals by the House of Commons, has just been published, and here are some of the changes, if you care to be interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The clause giving power to the archbishops and bishops to make rules under rubrics of the deposited book does not appear. The Declaration of Assent, it is explicitly provided, is to the Book of Common Prayer of 1662.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Prayers for the King (George V) must have a place in both morning and evening services. The Black Rubric is to be printed a second time at the end of the Alternative Communion Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then there is a long article on what is precluded, but to one who is thirsty for truth it is ■ as dry as Sahara and as empty as a large soap bubble. The Church of England is being propped and stayed up to stand a short time, but its ■whole scaffolding is about to collapse completely. After all, the Church of England has or is a religion;, and to belong to a certain religion you can use prayer books or beads to worship that religion and its creed. To worship the true God it will not be necessary to have acts of parliament; for those who worship the true God must worship Him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Well-Nigh Magical Effect of Electricity upon Plant-growing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">[From the German Edition of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age]</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">F</span><span class="font13">OR the last few years one may observe gardens near Berlin and other German cities, which produce gigantic fruits and vegetables of dimensions never before attained. These innovators in the art of gardening are pupils of a great master, a Frenchman, Dr. M. Justin Christofleau, living in La Queue-les-Yvelines, a small village in Normandy. He is the discoverer of an eletro-magnetic apparatus to capture earth’s electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">His method is being followed with great success throughout the world. Briefly stated, it consists of storing the natural electricity of the earth, and using it to serve the growing of plants. Dr. M. Christofleau is a decided opponent of any kind of fertilizer, natural or artificial. He holds that the plant-world receives all its food out of the air, to which the earth, of course, must have contributed a part of the necessary elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What we call life is in reality but natural electricity, says M. Christofleau. His fields are laid out in parallel furrows about three meters apart, drawn from north to south. Lengthwise into these furrows he puts a galvanized iron wire. The wire to the north is sunk into the earth, while to the south it is led up a 15- or 30-foot pole, and ends at the top in an antenna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The antenna receives the atmospheric (positive) electricity, and conducts it into the ground along the wire in the furrows. There it unites with the negative electricity, collected there by a network of wires, and thus forms the natural animating force which now can act directly</span></p>

<p><span class="font13"><sub>on</sub> the roots. It may be thus said that the «nts take an electric footbath, which has an _ nse fertilizing effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">geat, or other energy, also is carried to the lants <sup>1</sup> by catching the sun rays with great Mirrors of copper and zinc and conveying them </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font13"> the plantroots in the same wmy as the atmospheric electricity. If used merely to crop kinds of grapevines, berries, dwarf-fruits, tomatoes and clinging vines, the wires leading </span><span class="font12">from </span><span class="font13">north to south do not need to be cov</span><span class="font12">ered </span><span class="font13">with earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However it may be explained, it is an estab-d fact that by this method the productiveness of the soil is at least doubled. Moreover it should be specially noted that most fruits treated in this way develop to unusually large ^izes, and are richer in flavor. The soil will also be totally free from vermin, which can not bear the electric current. But, what is most important, the electricity makes fertilizers of all kinds superfluous. Every farmer and gardener knows what a great saving this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Inquiries among gardeners and farmers who have tried out this new method show astounding results. Tomatoes, for instance, ripened at a station near Berlin in two-thirds of the usual time. “Electrified” apple trees, which before bore only inferior grades of apples, now grow fruits reaching a diameter of twelve centimeters. Potatoes grew very quickly to an enormous size, even though the plants shot up a meter high. Most favorable are the reports about the recovery of the health of diseased fruit trees which had been treated with electricity according to the Christofleau method.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Whether the doctors like it or not, there are </span><span class="font12">now </span><span class="font13">some millions of people in the United States </span><span class="font12">' who arc </span><span class="font13">as sick of this serum idea as they ever </span><span class="font12">need to </span><span class="font13">be; the next thing the people will do is </span><span class="font12">to get </span><span class="font13">good and mad, and then come the lessons aforementioned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">rather than have his twelve-year-old son, Roy, submit to vaccination. Moreover, Peacock, who is fighting the battle of all anti-vaccinationists, declares that the boy will never be vaccinated as long as he lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One look at Peacock’s noble features, and all the honesty and love of liberty of a true Ameri</span><span class="font12">can </span><span class="font13">cries out against such a misuse of power.

<p><span class="font13">In Detroit the public are agitated because, after “educating” the school children to the point where they believe they must be vaccinated for diphtheria by the injection of toxin antitoxin, the Board of Health has now ordered the parents of something like 100,000 children to go to their own doctors and pay from $2 to $5 each for the three inoculations supposed to be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Formerly these children could have been inoculated free at clinics maintained at schools. The new system, by which the doctors of Detroit will clean up something like $250,000 among them, was ordered by the Board of Health, a board composed of doctors, at the initiation of the Wayne County Medical Society, a society also composed of doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Board of Health is horrified at the idea that the public should think that the doctors are laying their hands on this $250,000 because they want the money, and cites by way of an offset that the average income of doctors in New York is only $6,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A Cemetery Dinner and the Press </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By I. E. W. (Farmer)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font13">HE following instance, which happened in Ottawa, Kansas, is here brought to light in order that others might have a clearer understanding of why the people are not informed through the newspapers of the different cases of poisoning caused through the use of aluminum cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Before Memorial Day, 1928, the ladies of the cemetery association of Bennington, Kansas, announced through the local papers that on Memorial Day they would serve dinner’ in the basement of the Presbyterian Church to raise money to help the upkeep of the Bennington Cemetery, and asked that everybody eat their 'dinner that day. As it happened, a record crowd turned out to eat what was termed by the papers, “one of those famous dinners” served by the ladies of the cemetery association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The next morning the report started that from ten to fifteen persons had been poisoned by the dinner. Having been thoroughly convinced of the probable cause by articles in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font13">and by my own experiences with aluminum, I decided to investigate this cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As usual, as soon as it was learned that some had been poisoned the story started of rotten chicken being the cause. The food served had been donated by different ones, as nearly every one in the vicinity had been asked for donations for the dinner. I next learned from some who had helped prepare and serve the dinner that the kitchen of the church had been newly decorated and freshly supplied with some new aluminum cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The “rotten chicken” story was by this time being replaced by one that the chicken had been steamed too long. The number of the poisoned was increasing daily, and by this time the number reached the high mark of thirty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The first numbers of the weekly </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Ottawa County Democrat,</span><span class="font13"> published before this investigation was finished, had a nice report about the dinner which stated that the “famous” dinner was enjoyed by all and that everybody expected and looked forward to another one Eke it next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Asking several if there was anything wrong with the food served, they answered by a firm, “No. Not as far as I could see.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One lady who was poisoned very badly and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">302</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">who also helped serve the dinner was asked, “What do you think caused the poisoning?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“I do not know, but I believe they let the food stand too long in the cooking utensils,” she replied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“What kind of utensils were used for cooking and warming the food ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Nearly all aluminum. Most of it was new,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I found there was no basis for the theory of the chicken’s being the cause of the poisoning, because of those questioned who were poisoned some had eaten of chicken and some had not. And many who were not poisoned had eaten heartily of the chicken. By this time over seven- । ty-five persons were known to have been poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I then prepared this report, which was also sanctioned by others, for the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Ottawa County</span><span class="font13"> j </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Democrat,</span><span class="font13"> a Bennington paper, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Mes-</span><span class="font13"> j </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">s eng er,</span><span class="font13"> a Minneapolis paper. In this report I -d stated all.these facts found through this investi- I gation and stated that the cause was most prob- I ably due to aluminum poisoning, and cited in- I stances like it that had appeared in other places I which were said to be due to this cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After reading the report, the editor turned to I me and said, “I can’t print this; it is dangerous.” |</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">I, asked why it was dangerous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Because there are too many aluminum com- | panies represented through the country that ( might take offense.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“I have never noticed anything in your paper about this poisoning,” I said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Why is it necessary to print it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Isn’t that news ? Why do you print anything that happens throughout the country? Is it not so that the people who read your paper may know?” I answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The report was next taken to the Bennington paper’s editor, who said he was glad to learn of it and that he would print it, and also said he had eaten his share of the chicken and had not been poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Both editors stated that they did not deny the possibility of aluminum’s being the cause, but failed and refused to print a word about it. Why? Because the press is controlled by big business; and the people are left in darkness, suffering as a result.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">O</span><span class="font13">NE of the Biblical prophets wrote: “He [Jehovah] causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herbs for the service of man.” (Ps. 104:14) In this article we shall consider the value of herbs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is, or should be, but one idea, but one main object in medical practice,, and that is the improvement of the quality and circulation of the blood; for the blood is the life.

<p><span class="font13">Nutrition is the physical basis of life, and the disturbance of this function, such as expressed in the words “malnutrition” and “malassimila-tion”, must of necessity be regarded as potent factors in the host of ailments to which mankind is subject. The state of nutrition in any organism, whether it be plant or animal, determines the state of health of that organism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Man seems ever to be at variance with natural law, and in no way does he violate nature more than in his indulgence in eating and drinking.

<p><span class="font13">When the normal condition of the digestive, assimilative, and circulatory organs is interfered with in any way,&quot; defective circulation is the result; hence the importance of correct eating and drinking. Wrong feeding means poor blood, chemical unbalance. A clogged body is the outcome of such a condition. In proportion as the body is diseased, in that proportion functional activity is suspended. The vital organs slow down, and until normal function is restored health is an impossibility. Nature sometimes makes an effort at elimination. That is, the body makes an effort to overcome the clogged condition and eliminate the cause of the trouble. Hence the colds, fevers and inflammations to which we are subject; fever is nature’s effort literally to burn up toxins and thus help restore the normal condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">No machine will work properly if clogged and dirty, and it is exactly the same with the human mechanism. Health is amatterof purity of body and mind, and it is the writer’s object in this brief article to give some simple but powerfully effective information for the purification of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Much has been said in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font13"> on the vital question of diet, and your readers are no doubt fully acquainted with the fact that commercialized foods are little better than useless ; the natural produce of the earth being the ideal food for man, supplying the essential</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">mineral salts an3 vitamins In which “faked” food</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">is almost entirely deficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A most important point to impress, however, is that many of our cultivated foods are far from being perfect. Wrong and excessive manuring of the soil has most disastrous effects upon the health of vegetation and in some cases actually renders it unfit for human consumption. Also plants raised year after year on the same soil upon which no other crops have been grown are known to be deficient in organic mineral elements, the continual production of the one species without change having exhausted the soil of these elements. We are just beginning to learn something about correct fertilization; and a little while along the stream of time, when adverse influence has been withdrawn from the atmosphere of our planet and when it is fully under the control of a divine government, then and not until then will the earth yield her increase and produce perfect food suitable for a race of beings destined to live for ever if in entire harmony with the laws of the new government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">We find that wild herbs are rich in the vital elements so essential to life. All down through the ages herbs have been successfully used for the elimination of disease and the promotion of health. Herbs, noted for their virtues in certain disorders, have come down to us today, having withstood the acid test of time; and many of them stand unrivaled as specifics in certain diseases. What ancient herbalists learned from experience and observation modern science has enlarged upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Herbs that have been of value in diseases marked by a deficiency in one or more mineral elements have been found to be rich in the very element required, thus supplying nature with the thing she needed. Moreover, nearly all herbs have a powerful eliminative action, and morbid material is speedily eliminated through the system’s appointed channels. By clearing out the waste matter, supplying the essential chemical elements, and supplying nourishment at the same time, herbs come first in the ranks of therapeutical agents calculated to be harmless and effective in combating disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many years’ experience in various branches of healing has confirmed the above statements, and the writer would pin his faith to simple herbal remedies, combined with reconstructive</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Bbooklts, n.</span><span class="font13"> 7,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">diet, before any other known system. Herbs assist in eliminating the root cause underlying the symptoms produced. Most drugs are entirely foreign to the system and tend to suppress nature’s healing elfects; they interfere with all the vital functions and only add evil to evil. You can not cast out the devil by Beelzebub.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Massage, spinal adjustments, hydrotherapy and other natural methods can be employed in conjunction with the herbs if desired and, of course, attention should be paid to diet in all cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The fact must also be impressed upon the reader that one of the most evident causes of both physical and mental degeneration is wrong thinking. Morbid thoughts produce disease and poisons within the body, just the same as wrong feeding. Mind governs matter, and if one is ' suffering from a clogged brain that organ can , not function normally, and the body suffers. All the success ever accomplished in this imperfect &lt;&nbsp;world seems to have been accompanied by a i certain amount of sacrifice and self-restraint. It is so with those who are seeking health. Appetite must be curbed; physical desires and impulses subdued; thoughts must be pure: one <sub>; </sub>must be pure all through in order to enjoy a measure of goodly health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When mankind think correctly as a result of being in harmony with the laws of the glorious kingdom of Messiah; when they meditate only upon those things that are true, honest, pure and lovely; when love is the prominent characteristic in every human heart; when the Son of Righteousness floods the whole earth with His beams, then will come the desire of all nations, perfect health, mental and moral perfection, and —wonderful thought—-“God will dwell with them, and they shall be his people.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Acting on the principle that all disease, except where mechanical lesions are present, is I caused by impure blood and obstructed circula- I tion, the logical procedure in every-day ail- I ments is to aid elimination and improve the I blood and circulation. The following recipes are I entirely harmless and have proved effective | when all other means have failed. They may be I given to feeble and aged individuals without 1 fear of harm resulting, and should be persisted I with until the desired effects are produced. 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Anemia</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The cause of anemia is lack of iron in the blood. This can not be replaced by inorganic iron as purchased at a chemist’s; inorganic substances can not be accepted by the cells of the body. The natural way to supply the deficiency is by eating foods rich in organic iron. Watercress, leeks, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, celery, endive and carrots are all rich in iron. At least one salad a day should be eaten, composed of one or more of these vegetables. Cooking spoils vegetables and robs them of their mineral salts. One leaf of raw cabbage is better than a whole one boiled. All dark berries and fruits are rich in iron. Instead of ordinary tea, take bran tea. It is made by stewing a good quantity of ordinary bran in water. Strain it and add brown sugar and milk to taste. This is a wonderful drink for all diseases caused by a deficiency of mineral elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font11"> splendid herbal medicine is made by infusing an ounce each of yellow dock, bogbean, and comfrey leaves in a quart of water. Simmer slowly for twenty minutes. Strain and bottle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dose: A wineglassful every four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Appendicitis</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One ounce each of elderblossom, peppermint and yarrow; best crushed ginger, half an ounce. Simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Sweeten with old-fashioned black treacle (not golden syrup) and take a wineglassful every fifteen minutes until relieved. The medicine must be taken hot every time, and you must keep it up, sometimes for twenty-four hours. A cure is usually certain in the most severe eases. Do not be afraid of the perspiration caused. You may vomit at first, but that will pass off and you will be all the better for having an empty stomach. Use the leaves left over from each infusion to make a hot compress to cover the whole of the abdomen. You will, of course, need fresh infusions continually. Eat no food until a cure is established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Asthma</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sufferers should practically live out doors in pure air. Deep breathing should be practised daily in order to strengthen the chest and lungs. Leave alone the much advertised inhalants. Take one ounce each of vervain, horehound, and elecampane. Simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dose: A wineglassful every four hours. Cut down the diet, especially sugars and starches. Eat at least one good salad every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bronchitis</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Exactly the same as for asthma. Do not eat white sugar; pure honey is the ideal food for this complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Cancer</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Cancer is almost unknown among the Jews. This may be owing to the careful inspection of all their flesh foods. People who live on a vegetarian diet are also free from this scourge. The writer has heard of only one case where a vegetarian died from cancer, and that was in the system before the reform diet was adopted. A natural diet has been known to cure cancer. Never have more than three light meals per day, and have the food as raw as possible. Cut down the sugars and starches and thus give the body a chance to eliminate pathogen, the cause of the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here is a herbal remedy that has cured many very severe cases. Violet leaves, yellow dock, red clover tops, one ounce each. Simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Strain and take a wine-glassful every four hours. If there are any external sores make a poultice of the used herbs and apply freshly morning and night. Follow these instructions and startling results may await you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Catarrh</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Here again the sufferer must cut down sugar and starch, and include an abundance of green, leafy vegetables in his diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dissolve a teaspoonful, of salt in a tumblerful of warm water. Add ten to twenty drops of compound tincture of myrrh, then sniff up the nose until the solution returns by way of the mouth. Do this night and morning, or as often as required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Colds and Chills</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nature is making an effort to clear out the system. The remedy that never fails is a tea made with elderblossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger, as explained under appendicitis. Drink as much as you can in bed; put a hot water bottle to the feet and sweat the cause of the trouble away. Repeat within a few hours if necessary. Don’t feed a cold; if you do you will soon have to starve a fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Constipation</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Constipation is the root of many evils; it is the forerunner of auto-intoxication. Drugs can not cure, but in nearly all cases diet and herbs will do the trick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For breakfast take a plate of soaked raisins, prunes, and figs, with wholemeal bread and butter. Later on in the day have a good mixed salad, dressed with pure olive oil and lemon juice. Avoid white bread, condiments, sugar and sloppy puddings. Eat natural food that requires thorough chewing and be sure you do </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">chew it.</span><span class="font11"> A few Brazil nuts are good every day. Drink bran tea as explained under anemia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For a while a medicine may be necessary. A tea made of equal parts of senna leaves and mountain flax can be used for this purpose, or simple compound aloes pills. Vary the quantity to suit the case and gradually reduce as the bowels improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Consumption</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fresh air and water in abundance are essential. Keep your mind off your complaint and there is no</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">!j reason why you can not be completely cured' even if your case is a serious one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in your diet. Do not eat more than three eggs per week. Eat as much watercress as you possibly can; it is a wonderful curative agent for this malady. Avoid vinegar and condiments. Drink bran tea. (See anemia.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">JIere is a marvelous herbal medicine: Take of marshmallow root, golden seal and pleurisy root, half an ounce each; of linseeds, Iceland moss and liquorice root, one ounce each. Simmer in five pints of water for half an hour, well stirring the whole of the time. Strain and add one pound of best black treacle, j the old-fashioned kind. AVait until the concoction is cold and take a wineglassful every two hours in severe cases, less frequently in mild eases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Coughs</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The same as for consumption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Debility</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The remedy is the same as for consumption. If , anemia is present see remarks under that heading and take the herbal remedy there suggested. Cold or tepid friction baths every morning are of untold value in many cases. Wet the whole of the body and rub entirely dry with the palms of the hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Diarrhea</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">। Raspberry leaves and bayberry bark, half an ounce : each. Simmer in one and one-half pints of water for</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">'' twenty minutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">! Dose: A wineglassful every two or three hours. Add । cinnamon if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Diphtheria &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Simmer one ounce of red sage in one and one-half j pints of water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglass, ful as frequently as the case demands. The patient should drink plenty of diluted lemon juice and touch no food until well on the way .to recovery. Gargle i with the sage tea occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Dyspepsia</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">i Here we are at the fountain head of bodily disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">; We can only repeat what we have said in relation to diet, namely: Keep to natural food find thoroughly : chew everything. Find out what suits you best and stick to it. Never eat more than two kinds of food at one meal, and observe all the general dietetic hints <sub>:</sub> given herein under other headings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The writer knows of certain cases where the suffer-\ er was completely cured by a short fast; in other cases <sup>1</sup> by feeding exclusively on hard, wholemeal biscuits for a few weeks. If you can’t take a fast try the j latter method, but remember the biscuits must be gen-1 uine wholemeal unsweetened. After a while go on j other natural foods and keep to a sane diet if you do not want your trouble to return. Never drink with your meals. Leave off tea, coffee and cocoa; none of these beverages is good for anybody. Bran tea or dandelion coffee is the drink for all sufferers, no matter what their complaint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Epilepsy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Leave off all flesh foods. A vegetarian diet has cured hundreds of cases without any other aid. Exercise and fresh air are essential. Onions, either cooked or raw, should be eaten every day. Never take supper; a cup of bran tea is permissible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">As a medicine take of valerian root, vervain, wood betony and sculleap, one ounce each. Simmer in four pints of water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful every four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Female Complaints</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A tea made of equal parts of horehound and raspberry leaves will remove all obstructions and tend to produce the normal. This remedy may be taken freely without fear of the consequences, as. it is perfectly harmless. If taken freely by pregnant females easy birth in the vast majority of cases is positively assured. Such ladies should take about a pint per day, in wineglassful doses, for three or four months before the expected event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Headaches</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Treat as for epilepsy if the cause is nerves. If through stomach derangements take the remedy suggested for liver trouble and pay attention to remarks under dyspepsia. Worry is solely responsible for head affections in many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Heart Affections</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">If the stomach is deranged observe the rules suggested for dyspepsia. The stomach is ofttimes responsible for heart troubles. Take of motherwort, gentian root and scullcap, one ounce each. Simmer for twenty minutes in three pints of water. Strain and take ‘ a wineglassful every four hours. If you have any meat it should be boiled; flesh with the blood in it is bad for the heart. Jehovah’s instruction that the Jews should eat no flesh with the blood in it, is of interest. Aside from any spiritual significance it is • well to point out that there is a physical reason. The blood left in the veins of any dead animal is full of uric acid and other toxins, and it stands to human reason that the result of swallowing such blood is far from desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Abundance of fresh air is essential. Spinal manip- , ulation is sometimes strongly advisable where mechanical lesions are causative factors. Plenty of walking and gentle exercise are recommended in nearly all cases, the only rule being not to get tired; leave off at the first signs of fatigue or palpitation. The heart is a muscle, and as such it requires exercise to be healthy, just the same as any other muscle in the j body. The sufferer should never smoke or drink intoxicants. Liquids of all kinds should be taken only half an hour after meals, and then in moderation. The person suffering from heart trouble should be careful in sex matters, excesses often being responsible for the condition. Many cases of heart trouble can be cured by following these simple instructions, and all sufferers can be benefited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Inflammation</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For inflammation in any part of the body the remedy is elderblossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger tea. (See appendicitis.) This wonderful remedy will save life at the eleventh hour. Remember, it is absolutely harmless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Influenza</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The same as for colds and chills. A cure is certain, even in the most serious circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Kidney Trouble</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Pay attention to diet; take plenty of exercise; drink plenty of diluted lemon juice, and take the following medicine: Buchu leaves, parsley, juniper berries, one ounce each. Simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Press and strain. Take a wineglassful every four hours, or more frequently if occasion demands. Sometimes osteopathic treatment is necessary, but this is not often the case. Cold water packs applied each night over the small of the back are very useful. Steam baths are useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Liver Affections</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Diet as for dyspepsia and take the following medicine : Horehound, agrimony, crushed ginger, gentian, ' half an ounce each. Simmer in two and one-half pints of water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful every hour in severe attacks, otherwise every four hours. Cold or tepid friction baths should be taken every morning. A course of steam baths will be found very effective in most cases, especially those of long standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Neurasthenia</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The same medicine as for epilepsy. Pay attention also to remarks under dyspepsia. A cheerful mental attitude is essential, and sexual excesses must be avoided. A cold friction bath every morning is strongly recommended. Pure olive oil is also very good; dress your salads with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Piles</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Treat as for constipation. A good herbal ointment will be of much service, but the cure must come from within. Get a healthy bowel action and regenerate the blood, and the condition will disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Pleurisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Take one ounce each of stinging nettles and pleurisy root, and half an ounce of crushed ginger. Simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Strain and drink a cupful hot every two hours. Use the herbs themselves as a poultice over the affected area. This should cure within a few hours. Elderblossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger tea is also of great value in this complaint, but the nettle and pleurisy tea is best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Pneumonia</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">See under colds and chills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Rheumatism</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A vegetarian diet should be adopted, including plenty of green, leafy vegetables. Tea, coffee, cocoa and condiments should be avoided. Drink plenty of lemon juiee and bran tea, and take the following medicine: Bogbean, centaury, yarrow, yellow dock, one ounce each, and a dozen cayenne pods. Simmer in four pints of water for twenty minutes.. Take a wineglassful every four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Rub compound tincture -of myrrh into painful parts night and morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Rickets</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Defective development is caused by a lack of mineral elements and vitamins in food. Abundance of orange juice and grapes should be given to all children suffering in this manner. As they grow older include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet. Onions are very good indeed. Include genuine, wholemeal bread and fresh dairy butter with each meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A splendid medicine is made by infusing half an ounce each of wild tansy and agrimony in a pint of boiling water. Simmer for fifteen minutes and strain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Dose for young children: A tablespoonful four times daily. Older children should be given larger doses. Sweeten the medicine with black treacle or honey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Sleeplessness</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The remarks on epilepsy apply here. Plenty of deep breathing before going to bed will usually produce desired effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Wounds</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A dressing of diluted lemon juice and a few drops of compound tincture of myrrh is ideal for all wounds and sores. There are many good herbal ointments which can be supplied by any reliable herbalist. In nearly all cases the above dressing will be all that is necessary. For skin diseases a return to a natural diet, including fresh fruit and vegetables, is the truo remedy. Herbal medicine as for anemia. Medicated ointments of a suppressive nature do more harm than good; they drive the poisons back into the skin and hinder nature’s healing processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">“Nun Marvels at Outer World” </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By L. D. Barnes</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font13"> SEND, you herewith a clipping entitled “Nun</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Marvels at Outer World”, narrating the surprise of a nun who was changed to another convent when the old one was to be torn down. Everything she saw was new to her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Think of the poor old nun who came out of her prison “for the first time in fifty years”. A self-imposed imprisonment, shut away from human contact and the beauties of nature, under an assumed name, and all in a misguided effort to be religious and overcome the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How different the case of the Master, who mingled among men and of whom it is written that He went about doing good. Jesus overcame the world, but it was a different world and in a different way entirely. The world that He overcame was the Boman world of low politics, Jewish traditions and the practices of lawyers and hypocrites. In the Revelation after His resurrection He says, “To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I overcame.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Voluntarily going into jail and wearing a black and uncomfortable garb that looks worse than the orthodox Devil at dusk is not overcoming as He overcame. The world that the Christians must overcome, if they overcome as He overcame, is the low political world, the profiteering world with its mixture of variant religions, all red with the blood of innocents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Catholic nuns, kick out of it! The Devil;has deceived you; as written, he has deceived, the whole world. (Rev. 12:9; 13:14; 18:23) Take your family name and break for liberty. Keep no more company with fat and unmarried priests. Stay not in all that evil place, but escape for your lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To be free in Christ, is to be free indeed. His course is commended to you, poor dupes of -a demonized and wretched system of deception. Kick out of that infernal old black frock and don clothes adaptable to your sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is written of Jesus and the apostles, that they “went from house to house” ministering to the people. This beats building a big house and hiding away in it or inviting people to it and robbing them of their living to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Kick out before the Day of Vengeance with its foretold plagues is visited on the evil system that binds you..</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Where Are the Dead ?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">HpHE Montreal </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Baily Star</span><span class="font13"> says' that “Canon Shatford found in the Scriptures the assur-' ance that those who have departed are in a happier state than here”. That interested us because we know there is no place in the Bible where such a thing is even hinted, and so we went on reading. We came to the place where it said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Canon Shatford took his text ‘ from the Book of Wisdom, Chap. Ill, verses 1, 2, and 3: “The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise, they seemed to die, but they are in peace. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That explains it all. The canon might just as well have taken his text out of Mark Twain’s </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Innocents Abroad</span><span class="font13"> or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Tom Saiuyer,</span><span class="font13"> or Hoyle’s </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Games,</span><span class="font13"> or the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Brooklyn Eagle Almanac.</span><span class="font13"> The so-called “Book of Wisdom” may be interesting reading to those who are trying to defend an indefensible doctrine; but it is no part of the Bible. And the canon knows that very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The canon forgot to say how and why and when and where the non-church-members “are in a happier state than here”, and so we will tell him. They are happier because they are lying quietly asleep in death, awaiting the resurrection, not worrying about going to some mythical place of torment which never existed except in the minds of those who are trying to make an easy living by preying on the fears of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In other words, they are happier because they do not have to listen to sermons on “Where are the Dead?” by those who pretend to know the answer to the question and yet evidently know nothing at all about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If the canon really wants to handle this subject properly he should send in to headquarters and get Judge Rutherford’s book on the theme. Then he could preach the truth about it. But it would set him back ten cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The New Covenant </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">H</span><span class="font13">ERETOFORE in the examination of the subject matter of the reconciliation of man to God we found that the Scriptures disclose a covenant God made with Abraham, the law covenant with the Israelites, and the covenant by sacrifice with Christ. Now we come to the ___consideration of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah having made promise to bless all the families of the earth, it is certain that He will make all the necessary arrangements for such blessing and that such arrangements will be consistent with justice. Looking to the reconciliation of man to Himself, God promised to make a new covenant with Israel and Judah, and through such covenant all mankind may have an opportunity for complete reconciliation. By His prophet He said: “Behold, the . days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: . . . this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my A' law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”—Jer. 31: 31, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By the term “new covenant” is not meant 2__that the covenant is a modern one, nor that it</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">_ embodies entirely new features. The law cove-_ nant made in Egypt served as a typical model of the new covenant. The latter is called “new” ” because it is another arrangement that will accomplish fully what the law covenant in Egypt could not accomplish. The law covenant was definitely abolished and taken away; hence the new covenant is not a renewing of the first or law covenant. The covenant made in Egypt, which is the law covenant, continued for 635 years after Jeremiah prophesied concerning the </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">__n</span><span class="font13">ew covenant, as set forth in the above text. _^That shows that the law covenant was not old because of age, nor the new covenant new because not known about prior to the making of it. The Abrahamic covenant was made 430 years prior to the making of the law covenant in Egypt, and yet the Abrahamic covenant is not called old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Paul states that Sarah represented the Abrahamic covenant and Hagar represented the law covenant. (Gal. 4:24) After the death of Sarah Abraham did not renew his relationship with Hagar, but he took a new wife whose name</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;309.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font13">was Keturah. By Keturah Abraham had six sons. It is quite clear that Keturah represented the new covenant in the same sense that Hagar represented the law covenant in Egypt. This picture also teaches that the new covenant is not a renewing of the old, but entirely a new arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why with Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Was God under any obligation to the Jews to provide for and make a new covenant with them? The covenant which God made with Israel in Egypt they repeatedly broke. He was under no obligation to make a new covenant with them. They provoked God by turning to the Devil’s organization. For this God told Moses that He was disposed to destroy the Jews. “They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, 0 Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.”—Ex. 32:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Moses was a lineal descendant of Abraham. God could have made a new nation with Moses as the beginning thereof and could then have entered into a covenant with that nation. He could have carried out His purposes just as well in that manner. God did not destroy the Israelites. And why did He not destroy them? Because Jehovah’s own name was involved. Not only had He made promise to Abraham and his sons, but Shiloh had been promised through the line of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Moses made a plea to God and said to Him: “Wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. And. the</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.”—Ex. 32:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Other scriptures show that the name of Jehovah was involved. “Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.” (Jer. 14:21) God had given His word, and both His name and word were involved. This was the good and sufficient reason why Israel was not destroyed. “For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.” (Isa. 48:9) “But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt ... .” “Then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.”—Ezek. 20: 9, 13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah would have Israel and all His creatures to know that He is the only true God and that life can not be had except as a gracious gift from Him. This is proven by His words through His prophet: “And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, </span><span class="font12">0 </span><span class="font13">ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God.”— Ezek. 20: 34, 44.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Parties to Covenant</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah makes the new covenant on one side; and who is in the other side of the covenant? According to the words of the Prophet Jeremiah it is Judah and Israel: “I will make a covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.” Through His prophet God said to them: “Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord God. And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.” “And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord.”—Ezek. 20: </span><span class="font12">36, 37; 16: 62.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But how could Israel be brought into the covenant, seeing that Israel is at enmity with God? The answer is found in the words of God through His prophet: “In those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgot-ten.”-—Jer. 50:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Be it noted that they must come to Zion to join themselves in covenant with Jehovah. They . can not of themselves make a covenant with the Lord. Zion is God’s organization. Christ Jesus being the chief One of Zion, the name applies to Him individually and specifically. The houses of Israel and Judah, being at enmity with God, -are not competent to enter into a covenant with Jehovah. The same is true with reference to ) all men. Israel therefore must have some one who is competent to act for and in her behalf and to assume the responsibility of the cove- ’ nant and to treat directly with Jehovah God. Concerning this qualified One, Paul writes: ; “And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is writ- j ten, There shall come out of Sion the Deliver- j er, and shall turn away ungodliness from Ja- j cob: for this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.”—Rom. 11: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The contracting parties, therefore, are Jeho- j vah on the one side and the ONE whom Jeho- </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font13">vah designates to act for and in behalf of Israel ; as Israel’s representative. That One must be able to lift the disability from Israel and to take ' away her sins. The Jews are included in the ransom sacrifice given for all, because Jesus t gave His life a ransom for all. (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6) « Jesus also redeemed the Jews, from the curse ) of the law by nailing it, the law covenant, to 3 the cross and abolishing it. All their lifetime the Jews were in bondage because of their inability to keep the law, which shows them to be •. sinners and therefore in bondage to sin and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The covenant by sacrifice. made at the Jor- j dan brings this profit to the Jews, to wit, a way jj for them to be relieved from the disabilities t under which they rested. The covenant by sac- | rifice was made at the Jordan. God counted it finished from that time forward. Having re- g</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">deemed the Jews from under the bondage which rested upon them, Jesus at once became the rightful owner of the Jews, and it became His right to act for and in behalf of Israel. He was competent to act, and is the One selected by Jehovah to act in making the new covenant. The Jews are not even to this day competent to enter into a covenant with Jehovah God. If we should find from the facts that the new covenant has been made, then surely it could not have been made directly with the Jews. The Scriptures show that Christ, the Head of God’s organization and coming out of that organiza-— tion, Zion, is the One who acts for and in behalf of Israel and by whom Israel is brought into the covenant. Abstractly stated, the new covenant . is made by Jehovah on the one side and by Christ Jesus on the other side as the legal representative of Israel, composed of the houses &quot;<sup>:1</sup> of Israel and Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jacob’s name was changed to that of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Israel was a grandson of Abraham. In line &quot;&nbsp;ivith His promise to Abraham, God had said to</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Israel: “In thy seed shall all the families of the / earth be blessed.” (Gen. 28:14) Judah was a son of Israel, and God had promised that the descendant of the line of Judah should be the One through whom the blessings would come. “Unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” (Gen. 49:10) Jesus was of the house of Judah. He is designated “The Lion of the tribe of Judah”. (Rev. 5:5) It was with the descendants of Israel that God made the law covenant. - Israel, Judah and all their descendants were imperfect, and none of them could do that which was perfect. The Israelites could not keep the law perfectly. Jesus kept the law perfectly and fulfilled every jot and tittle of the law. (Matt. 5:17,18; Col. 2:14) He was born a Jew under the law, and being a lineal descendant of the house of Judah according to the flesh, and. keeping the law perfectly, He became the rightful owner of every blessing promised to Israel and Judah. Therefore when God said He would make ■ a new covenant with Israel and Judah, it follows that He would make it with the one who held all the rights that Israel and Judah and their descendants could have held if they had been perfect. The new covenant could have been made with no one else than the perfect man Jesus, and with Him in behalf of all mankind, and for the purpose of effecting reconciliation of mankind to God.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>When and Where Made</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">The Scriptural proof is overwhelming that the new covenant was macle between Jehovah and Jesus at the time of the slaying of Jesus as the real passover lamb. On the fourteenth day of Nisan, 33 A. D., Jesus met with His disciples at Jerusalem and ate the passover lamb as enjoined upon Jews by the law. He, being the One foreshadowed by the passover lamb slain in Egypt, was the One to fulfil the picture, the fulfilling of which required His life. It was necessary for Jesus to eat the passover before He died. At the conclusion of the eating of the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of Nisan, 33 A. D., Jesus instituted the- memorial of His death. At the same time he designated His blood poured out as the blood of the new covenant. “And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it: for this is my blood of the new testament [covenant] , which is shed for many for the remission of sins.”—Matt. 26: 26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The word in this text translated “testament”' is from the same root word translated “covenant”. It is the first time this Greek word, which is translated covenant, appears in the New Testament. These words were spoken by Jesus, and He alone on the earth at that time was competent to understand and express the meaning of the passover. Jesus was here referring to His own blood, which was poured out that same day. The shedding of that blood was foreshadowed by the blood of the passover lamb slain in Egypt at the time the law covenant. was made. The words of the prophet show that the law covenant was made in Egypt: “Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 31:32) The day Israel was led out of Egypt foreshadowed the day of the death of the real paschal Lamb and fixes the time for the making of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Paul, writing concerning the institution of the memorial of the death of Jesus on the night of the same day in which Jesus died, says: “After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new Tes-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ij 812 g</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jament [covenant] in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.” (1 Cor. 11: 25) Paul spoke with authority, and the only y proper conclusion that can be had from his words is that the covenant was then and there made, and that the blood of Jesus shed that ‘day was the blood of that covenant, which made I • it sure and firm. In the same connection Paul said: “The cup of blessing which we bless, is 1 it not the communion of the blood of Christ?” y (1 Cor. 10:16) He referred to the same cup which Jesus said is the blood of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In support of this conclusion are the words of Paul later written: “For a testament [covenant] is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength, at all while the testator <sup>1</sup> live th.” (Heb. 9:17) Rotherham renders the <sup>!</sup> text thus: “For a covenant over dead persons is firm, since it is not then of force when he is living that hath covenanted.” The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font13"> says: TA covenant is firm over dead victims.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">i In the law covenant made in Egypt, Moses V contracted in behalf of Israel, and the blood of ’ that covenant was the passover lamb. In a representative capacity Moses there died, the lamb dying for him. On that fourteenth day of i Nisan, Moses, representatively dying, foreshad-[ owed Jesus who actually died on the fourteenth j of Nisan, 33 A. D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A testator is one who dies after having made : &nbsp;&nbsp;a will or covenant. Jesus was the covenanter</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">d. or testator, and after making the covenant He died on the same day. Jehovah was on the other ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;side of the covenant, and He could not die. It</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">/ &nbsp;&nbsp;was the man in the covenant who died. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">'definitely fixes the date of the covenant, beyond question of a doubt. But God really supplied the victim for death, namely, His beloved Son, ' : and thereby Jehovah shared in the sacrificial part. Now, says Paul, the covenant is made firm over the dead victim. The appropriate time j for making the new covenant is the day that the old law covenant ended. That law covenant ended on the fourteenth of Nisan, 33 A. D., the same day Jesus died and the same day the new covenant was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ Seeing that Jesus is the real contracting party on behalf of Israel and all mankind, the - making of the covenant would not need to wait until Israel is restored, nor until the time for the beginning of restoration; nor is there any reason why the blood of Jesus should be reserved until the glorification of the church and then used for the making of the new covenant. Nor is it at all necessary that the ransom price should be paid before the new covenant is made. '</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Mediator &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">The new covenant being made by Jehovah with Israel, it is manifest that a mediator is necessary. Jehovah can not consistently, and does not, enter directly into a covenant with any person or people who are not in full harmony with Him. The Jews were out of harmony with Him. Jesus had pronounced Jehovah’s decree declaring that their house was left desolate. The Jews had rejected Jesus as their King. They had failed to keep the law covenant and were under the bondage of sin. Who, then, could be the mediator in the covenant for them? Essentially Jesus alone, because He was the only perfect man on earth and was in full accord with Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A mediator is one who stands between the competent and the incompetent party to the contract and acts in a representative capacity for and in behalf of the incompetent one. This rule is recognized in worldly organizations. A full-grown man desires to make a contract with a minor child or with an insane person concerning the property interest of such. The full-grown man is competent in the eyes of the law, but the minor or the insane person is incompetent to contract. A court of proper jurisdiction appoints a third person who possesses the legal qualifications to make a contract, to act as guardian or mediator for his incompetent ward. The contract is then made, and necessarily it must be made directly by the full-grown man on one side, who contracts for himself, and the qualified man on the other side, who as guardian or legal representative, contracts for and on behalf of his ward. When the minor becomes of mature age or the insane person is restored to sanity there no longer exists a necessity for a guardian or mediator, and the office there ceases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Jews were incompetent because they were born in sin and shapen in iniquity. (Ps. 51: 5) Their covenant with Moses as mediator on their behalf had failed because of the imperfections of themselves and Moses. Jesus made an end to the law covenant when it was nailed to the cross at His crucifixion. He fulfilled the law</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">covenant and it became obsolete. This He accomplished by His death. “And for this cause [that is to say, because the blood of Christ purges away sin] he [Jesus] is the mediator of the new testament [covenant], that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament [covenant], they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.” (Heb. 9:15) The Jews were guilty of transgressions under the law covenant and the blood of Jesus redeemed them therefrom, and therefore He is the prepared and duly appointed One to act as Mediator of the new covenant made in their be. half and in behalf of all mankind for the purpose of reconciling all men who obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As further proof that the new covenant has been made and that Jesus is the Mediator thereof, reference is made to the words of Paul addressed to the church: “Ye are come [approaching] ... to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.” (Heb. 12: 22-24) At the time Paul wrote these -words Jesus was the Mediator and the covenant had been made, because the covenant must be made with a mediator as the only qualified one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">. The Apostle Paul says concerning that law covenant that it had “ordinances of divine service, and a worldly [orderly arranged] sanctuary.” (Heb. 9:1) He also says that these things were a figure for a time of a better sanctuary and of divine service in connection there. with. In connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness there was a divine service, and those who ministered there were of the Levitical . priesthood. In connection with the holy sanctuary, “not made with hands” but in heaven it. self, Christ Jesus the great High Priest ministers. That which was done in the tabernacle of the wilderness foreshadowed what Christ Jesus would be in connection with the heavenly sanctuary. The ministry of Jesus Christ is far ....... more excellent than was that in relation to the tabernacle. By His faithfulness unto death He provided the great ransom price. In doing this He offered up Himself as a great sacrifice for sin. Thereafter He offers the members of His body also, they being taken into His covenant by sacrifice by the grace of God. This service He performs as minister or priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What, then, did He obtain besides this excellent ministry? He is made Mediator of the new covenant. “But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.” (Heb. 8:6) The basis of that new covenant is His own blood shed for man, and this gives promise of better things for mankind than the old covenant could possibly give. The ministers of the law covenant died and were unable to save Israel in that covenant. But Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant, is able to save them to the uttermost. This is true because He lives for ever and holds the priesthood for ever. “But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is able also to ’save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”—Heb., 7: 24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The new covenant, therefore, is established, not only on better promises, but upon the precious blood of Jesus Christ, which gives promise to all who believe and obey that they shall live for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Surety</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was at the Jordan that Jesus was accepted by the Father as the great ransom sacrifice. There He was appointed to the duties of the office of sacrificing priest. He was priest of the Most High God, therefore priest according to the rank of Melchizedek. There it was that God gave His oath that Christ Jesus shall abide as High Priest for ever and that there would never be a change. That was three and one-half years before the new covenant was made. At that time Jesus was made surety or guarantor of the new covenant. Note the argument of Paul upon this point. “By as much as this hath Jesus become surety of a better covenant also.”— Heb. 7: 22, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By this much of what? is asked. Surely it was by the ransom sacrifice that Jesus became the surety of the covenant, because His is the blood of the covenant. But immediately following Jesus’ consecration Jehovah gave His oath that He was a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. Therefore by the sacrifice of Himself He was made surety of the covenant, and in addition thereto by the oath of Jehovah the matter was made doubly sure. This is shown by the language of Paul: “And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: (for those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec).” —Heb. 7: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">By comparing this scripture with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font13"> translation it will be observed that Rotherham omits the words in verse twenty, to wit, “he was made a priest.” The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font13"> does the same thing. These words are supplied in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Authorised Version.</span><span class="font13"> Jesus w<sup>T</sup>as already a priest of the order of Melchizedek, but now at the time of His consecration He was made a priest for ever with no possibility of a change and according to the rank of Melchizedek. By His blood and by the oath He was made the surety of the better covenant. Through His prophet God had said: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font13"> the Lord . . . will give thee for a covenant of the people.” (Isa. 42:6) Primarily this prophetic testimony must apply to Jesus alone. The body members taken into the covenant by sacrifice become thereafter a part of The Servant, and this is a secondary matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The gorrect conclusion therefore seems to be that at the time of His consecration Jesus was made surety or guarantor of the new covenant and that the new covenant was made at the time of His death. Since it must be made with Him as Mediator for Israel and all mankind, it follows that He became the Mediator of the new covenant at the time of His death at Calvary. Therefore just before He went to Calvary, and on the same day He exhibited to His disciples the cup of ■wine, He said to them: “This is [representatively] my blood [representatively] of the new testament [covenant], which is shed for many for the remission of sins.” (Matt. 26: 28) The blood of Jesus therefore provided the ransom price and at the same time is the blood for making firm the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Body Members Taken In</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As used herein the word “inaugurate” is intended to be understood as meaning to ratify and confirm, and cause to begin to operate or function, to establish, to initiate or begin with the first act of operation. It seems quite certain from the Scriptures that when the new covenant is inaugurated and begins to function, the church, which is the body of Christ, will have part in the mediatorial work. And why this conclusion? Because the body members have been taken into the, covenant by sacrifice, and offered up by Chri Jesus as a part of His sacrifice, and therefore become of Christ, the body members functioning with Him in the ministration of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">God through His prophet says: “In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant^ of the people, to establish the earth.” (Isa. 49:8) Paul quotes this prophetic utterance and applies it to the church. (2 Cor. 6:2) This is proof that the body members of Christ are a part of The Servant and that they, together with Christ Jesus the Head, are given “for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth”. “To establish the earth” means to erect a stable and righteous government on earth for man. It also proves that the body members will participate with the Head Christ Jesus in the administration of the covenant. Paul also shows that the prophecy has an application to the body members during the time of the selection and development of the church. In that time they are members of The Servant and are ambassadors for Christ to preach the message of reconciliation. Therefore they should see to it that this great favor from God is not received by them in vain, says the apostle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do the Scriptures teach that the church, which is the body of Christ, has anything to do with the making or sealing of the new covenant? The body members have nothing to do with making the new<sup>7</sup> covenant, for the obvious reason that the covenant was made between God and Jesus Christ as the representative of man before any man was begotten as a member of the church of Christ. The Scriptures.say nothing about the sealing of the new covenant, and certainly not that the church has anything to do with it. Referring again to Paul’s argument, in Hebrews 9:17, he states that a covenant is of force or made firm over the dead victim. The man Christ Jesus was the victim of death whose blood made firm the covenant. The covenant became effective from the moment of His death. It is sure, firm, and stedfast for ever thereafter. There is no occasion, then, for such a thing as the sealing, as that word is used in connection -with execution of documents between earthly contracting parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Beginning at Pentecost, which was several days after the new covenant was made, men began to be brought into covenant by sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The disciples were there accepted as a part of Christ’s sacrifice. This has been true of Christians since. Being brought into Christ, these have committed to them a ministry of reconciliation, and it becomes their privilege and duty to serve that which is the spirit of the new covenant, to wit, proclaim to the people God’s message of reconciliation. They are therefore ministers of the spirit of the new covenant because the spirit of it is reconciliation.—2 Cor. 3: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The law covenant was made in Egypt. Egypt is a type of the world or Satan’s organization. The law covenant foreshadowed the new covenant. It is therefore appropriate that the new covenant be made in the world, and the facts show that it was made while Jesus was in the world but not a part of it. Jesus Christ on earth offered Himself as the antitypical passover lamb. At the time He was slain as the antitypical lamb Jesus alone assumed the obligations of the covenant for its beneficiaries. The covenant became effective at that time. From Pentecost forward the first-borns have been passed over and delivered, not by reason of the new covenant, but by virtue of the sacrifice of the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Participate in Inauguration</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The body members of Christ will have part in the inauguration of the new covenant as indicated by the Scriptures. The ceremony of the inauguration of the law covenant at Mount Sinai is described by the apostle in this language : “For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people.” (Heb. 9:19) Both calves and goats were sacrificed on that occasion, and the blood of both sprinkled on the book of the law and upon the people. That would indicate that Moses represented there the One pictured by the animals that were sacrificed, to wit, the calf (bullock), representing Jesus, and the goat, representing the body members of the church. Once each year the law covenant was renewed with the blood of the bullock (calf) and the goat, which were sacrificed on the day of atonement. Consistently, the calf and the goat would represent the same persons on both the occasion of the inaugurating and that of the renewing of the covenant. This seems clearly to foreshadow that the body members, represented by the goat, would have something to do in connection with the inauguration of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At the inauguration of the law covenant Moses told the people the words of the Lord God, and the people agreed to do them. At the same time, and in this connection, the sacrifices were offered by young men. “And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord.” (Ex. 24:5) These “young men” well picture the younger brethren of Jesus whom Jesus has taken into His covenant by sacrifice and who by reason of being a part of Christ participate with Him in the inauguration of the new covenant. These correspond to the “young men” mentioned by the Apostle John. They are the ones wholly devoted to the Lord God. “I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.”—1 John 2:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Priesthood</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The words of the apostle strongly support the conclusion that a priesthood is associated with the new covenant and the administration thereof. “Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.” (Heb. 9:1) The worldly tabernacle here mentioned had a service in connection therewith and was in a figure representing the true tabernacle. (Heb. 9:9) It is here on earth that the service begins that relates to the real tabernacle and real atonement day, because it was on earth that Jesus was sacrificed. That would be another proof that the new covenant was made at the death of Jesus. The yearly service in connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness would testify that there is a divine service in connection with the inauguration of the new covenant and that there would be a long period of time elapsing between the making and the inauguration of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Knowing that the divine services of the tabernacle in the wilderness foreshadowed the divine services of the real tabernacle, we may use the figure to ascertain what is the true meaning of the reality. On the annual atonement day of Israel a bullock was slain and the high priest</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">took its blood and entered the Most Holy and there sprinkled the blood to make atonement for Himself and his house. (Lev. 16:6) By “for himself” is meant in behalf of those who shall compose the members of his body, the under-priesthood. By the term “his house” is meant those of the household of faith which shall include all who are justified and spirit be? gotten aside from those composing the mem-<sup>5</sup> hers of his body, the under-priesthood. With that ceremony performed, then the high priest returned to the court, killed the goat of the sin-offering which is for the people, and carried its blood into the Most Holy and there made atonement for the sins of the people by sprinkling that blood as he did the blood of the bullock.—Lev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">At this sacrifice the bullock represented the poured-out life-blood of Jesus Christ alone. The blood of the goat represented the body members of Jesus Christ taken into the covenant by sacrifice and made a part of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Therefore it essentially represented the blood of Christ in both instances, but it is the goat in which the church is represented in Christ. The Christian era has been the time of sacrifice during which time the members of the body of Christ have been selected. During that period of time what is being done concerning the new covenant? The body members are ministering to the spirit thereof by proclaiming the message of God’s plan relative to the blessing of all the families of the earth. When the period of sacrifice is complete, as represented by the Lord’s goat, then, as shown by the picture, the blood of Christ, including the body members’, is presented and used to make atonement for the sins of the people. What, then, is to done concerning the new covenant? Will the blood then be used as a basis for making the new covenant? No, because that covenant was made when Jesus was on the earth. ■Will the blood be used then to seal the new covenant? To be sure not! Because the covenant was made sure at the time it w’as made and Jesus was made surety for it even before. Nowhere in the Scriptures is the covenant spoken of as being sealed. What then is to be done at the end of the period of sacrifice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Inauguration</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When the atonement for sin is made for the people, then the time is due for the inauguration of the new covenant. The law covenant was made in Egypt and inaugurated at Mount Sinai, which represented Mount Zion. That picture shows that the new covenant is made on earth and must be inaugurated at Mount Zion, in heaven itself. It is in heaven that the sprinkling of the blood for the inauguration takes place. (Heb. 12:24) At the inauguration of the law covenant at Mount Sinai Moses sprinkled the blood both on the book and on the people. “For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people.” (Heb. 9:19) (See Exodus 24: 6-8.) The book of the law represented God’s expressed will, because He dictated it. As Moses read the book of the covenant to Israel, likewise will Christ publish the terms of the new covenant to Israel and to all mankind and thereby open up The highway of life’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When the law covenant was inaugurated the people of Israel were at the foot of Mount Sinai, having previously been delivered from Egypt. 'When the inauguration of the new covenant takes place the people will have been delivered from the world, Satan’s organization foreshadowed by Egypt, and'will be at the foot of Mount Zion, which is the mountain of God, to wit, His kingdom subject to the instruction of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Assembly at Ceremony</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Who will be present at the inauguration of the new covenant? Addressing the church, Paul says: “But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.” (Heb. 12:22-24) “The city of the living God” is His organized kingdom of righteousness. The Scriptures indicate that there will be present an innumerable company of angels. Throughout the development of the divine plan these mire, holy, mighty and loyal angels, wholly devof to God, have been performing their service. ri is like God to have these faithful ones present at the inauguration of the covenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">that is to reconcile mankind to Himself. Then Paul says it will be the general assembly of the church of the first-born, which shows that the church will then be complete. There the great Jehovah God, the Judge over all, will manifest His presence. Jesus, the Mediator of the hew covenant, the most exalted One of the universe next to Jehovah, will be there. Thus are shown Jehovah and Jesus, the two competent contracting parties to the covenant,, at its inauguration. At that time the body members of Christ will be joined with Him as one composite Mediator. These 'will be under-priests of Jesus acting w-ith Him and under His diree-7. tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How’ about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the others of the faithful, heroes whom we call ancient worthies? Will they be present and have a partin the ceremony? Would it be necessary for the new covenant to be inaugurated and in operation before these faithful ones are raised .......from the dead? No, because it is the great ransom sacrifice applied as a sin-offering that guarantees their resurrection. The new cove. nant has nothing to do with awakening them, out of death. Those worthy men, faithful to the end, received a good report from God because of their faith. By faith they saw the day of Jesus Christ and rejoiced. Paul says: “They without us [the church] should not be made “perfect.” (Heb. 11:40) It follows then that when the church is completed, when all who have been taken into the covenant by sacrifice have finished their course, then is the due time for the bringing forth of the ancient worthies. At the inauguration of the law covenant not only Aaron and others who were in line for the priesthood were present and participating with Moses, but there were “seventy of the elders of Israel” also present. “Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the ' elders of Israel: and they saw the God of Israel: and there &quot;was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. And upon 1 “the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.”—Ex. 24: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These seventy were men of importance and . are called in this text “nobles”, which means chief men or chosen men. Whom could these foreshadow if not the worthies mentioned in the Old Testament and by Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews ? Those faithful worthies were not all of Israel. Some of them lived before Israel was chosen. Therefore they would be featured at the inauguration of the new covenant as earthly representatives of Israel and all others of mankind. Be it noted that in the above text it is stated: “Also they saw God, and did eat and drink.” Not that they could see with natural eyes God’s glorious body, but that they could see a manifestation of His power and fully understand the meaning thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In describing the assembly Paul says: “To the spirits of just men made perfect.” (Heb. 12:23) Those faithful men of old were justified because of their faith and loyalty to God. When the ransom sacrifice is applied as a sin-offering for the people, to remove the legal disability, that is the time when the- spirit or power of life of these justified men will be made perfect. This is a further corroboration that the ancient worthies will be present at the inauguration of the new covenant. They will not be in heaven; but on earth, performing some specific function at the inauguration of the covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Marvelous Ceremony</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">At</span><span class="font13"> the inauguration of the law covenant at Horeb, the mount of God, the ceremonies fore-shadow<sup>T</sup>ed the inauguration of the new covenant at Mount Zion, or mount of God, or God’s organization. About that there does not seem to be any occasion for doubt. Paul directly links the two together. As to whether there will be a grand and mighty ceremony, we have but to look at what happened at Mount Sinai. At that time Jehovah manifested His presence in a great cloud upon the mountain, and there were fire, thunder, lightning, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud. (Ex. 19:16) Referring to this same matter, Paul says: “And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: (for they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: and so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly rear and quake).”—Heb. 12:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What then should be expected at the inauguration of the new covenant? The angels of heavenwill b’eass^bled 'there. The church of the first-born will be there. Jesus, the glorious Mediator, with His under-priests, will be there; and above all Jehovah God. None of these will be visible to human eyes, but God has often manifested His presence by a demonstration of His power. The ancient worthies will be there to represent both houses of Israel and all mankind. All there would see the presence of the Lord God made manifest in the cloud, the tempest, the storm and fire, which demonstration will surely be given in a far more marvelous manner than human phrase can describe. Then all shall know that Jehovah is the great God and that Christ is King over all the earth. The faithful worthies all died before the crucifixion of Jesus. Where have they been during all these centuries? The clergy say they have been in heaven; but in this the clergy are wrong, as in almost everything else.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Bible Questions and Answers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">/&quot;QUESTION:</span><span class="font13"> Where did Cain get his wife? N&amp; </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font13"> The place where Cain got his wife is the same place where Seth got his wife; that is, they both married their sisters. If you will refer to Genesis 5:4 you will see that besides Cain, Abel and Seth, Adam had numerous daughters whose names have not come down to us. Without question, Cain and Seth married these daughters. If that were not the case, the question might as reasonably be asked, Where did Adam’s daughters get their husbands ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font13"> Where is Elijah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font13"> Not only did the Lord Jesus say, in John 3:13, “No man hath ascended into heaven,” but subsequently the Apostle Peter, speaking under inspiration on the day of Pentecost, said, “David is not ascended into heaven,” and. in Hebrews 11:40, after narrating a long list of the ancient worthies, the Apostle Paul says that “they without us should not be made perfect”. In the chapter last mentioned the apostle runs over a great list, and at the conclusion says, “These all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise.” We are not questioning that Elijah w<sup>r</sup>as caught up into heaven by the whirlwind, and probably the same thing happened to him that would happen to anybody else that got caught up in a whirlwind. The Scriptures speak of the birds of heaven, and it is our thought that it was into that heaven that Elijah was taken; but we believe that the whirlwind took his life and that he is still dead, awaiting the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Question;</span><span class="font13"> Who was Melchisedec?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font13"> There is no account in the Scriptures as to who was the father or who was the mother of Melchisedec. There is no statement as to when or where he was born or of when or where he died. The various statement's regarding Melchisedec are to be understood in harmony with this information. Melchisedec was a man like other men, but was a man who was living very close to God; for the Scriptures declare that he was one of God’s prophets. A suggestion has been made that Melchisedec and Shem are one and the same person, and this thought seems reasonable to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font13"> What did our Lord mean by the ' statement, “It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God” ?—Luke 18: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Ansiver:</span><span class="font13"> In the gates of Eastern cities (which were closed after a certain hour at night) there was a narrow passageway styled “The Needle’s Eye Gate”, through v<sup>T</sup>hich belated travelers might find access into the city. It is said that in order for a camel to pass through one of these needle’s eye gateways it was necessary for the camel to be divested of its burden, and even then it was helped through the gateway ; with difficulty. We can see how this is in its application to the rich man’s entering into the kingdom of heaven. The rich have much to give up, or at least they think they have, and for that reason they find it difficult to make an unreserved consecration to the Lord. We see this illustrated in the case of the rich young ruler who came seeking the way to everlasting life and ; yet was not willing to make a consecration which : involved the turning of his riches ove<sup>1</sup>' into the j Lord’s care. This does not mean that ere will j be no rich men in the kingdom of heaven, nor [ does it mean that there will be any serious diffi- i culty on their part in entering into the kingdom j of God when the broad gates to that city are j thrown open during the Millennial Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Story Twenty-Three</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">J</span><span class="font13">ESUS’ life was becoming more eventful all the time, as we can see from the accounts, in the Bible, of the numerous places He visited, the wonderful things He did, and the many people to whom He preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font13"> little while after He healed the leper in a certain city of Galilee, Jesus had occasion to cross the sea of Galilee. This is a pretty large body of water, really a part of the River Jordan, but is formed by the river’s running into a broad and shallow valley and spreading all over this area until it finds an outlet at the lower end, and continues its course as a river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This naturally makes a very large lake of the valley, or, as it is known in Palestine, a sea; though we are bound to admit that, as seas go, the sea of Galilee is a pretty small one. Perhaps that is the reason why storms affect it so adversely, stirring up terrific waves and currents which toss the boats about and make them put for shelter in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You know that any body of water that is broad and shallow is easily roughened by a heavy wind. That is why Lake Erie is so dangerous in stormy weather. It is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, and the high winds that sweep down from the Canadian Northwest whip great waves of destructive power from its waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So we see that a shallow body of water is a dangerous place to be on in a storm. Even big boats do not have a very good time of it on Lake Erie in a storm, and in Jesus’ day there wore no big boats of any description. The boats which sailed the waters of the sea of Galilee Were no exception to this rule. They were light, frail barks, carrying but a few sails, and holding a small number of passengers, probably not more than twenty or thirty at most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was in one of these that Jesus embarked to cross the little-sea of Galilee in Palestine. The day was bright and clear when He stepped on board, and Jesus lay down in the boat to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Probably the motion of the waves, which was at first gentle and regular, rocked Jesus into a sound and deep sleep. At any rate, the tempest that arose a short time later did not disturb Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It was a terrific storm: the clouds were blade and piled layer on layer like the battlements of an ancient city; the wind howled across the water, churning it into waves that loomed higher than the masts of the little boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Spray flew in the eyes of those who peered ahead, trying to see through the mky blackness; terrific peals of thunder crashed incessantly above their heads; lurid gleams of lightning rifted the clouds and darted dizzily toward them. They became afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Elis disciples came to Jesus, who was sleeping peacefully in the midst of all this, and woke Him, crying, “Master, master, we perish </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And Jesus said to His disciples: “Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?” And He stood up, and rebuked the winds and the waves, and the storm abated, and there was a great calm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Then every one on board the little ship marveled, and said, “What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is no doubt that Satan the Devil stirred up that storm on the lake of Galilee in an attempt to destroy Jesus, for as we have learned, Lucifer, or Satan the Devil, was jealous of Jesus, and hated Him; for he knew that it was prophesied that the time was not far distant when Jesus would take over the kingdom of the earth and heal the wounds that Satan had made in the breast of mankind by his misrule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Satan also knew’ the prophecies taught that because he had betrayed the trust which Jehovah God gave to him in the beginning, there would come a time when God would destroy him, utterly and for ever, and so Satan would like very much to destroy Jesus, the Lamb of God, first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But Almighty God would, of course, not permit such a thing to happen/ He allows Satan to go just so far, and then puts His hand between the Devil and those whom he would harm. So on Galilee’s little tempestuous lake did the power of God, as exercised by Jesus, His Son, block the plans of Satan the Devil and calm a storm that no human being could possibly have survived in such a frail craft.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
