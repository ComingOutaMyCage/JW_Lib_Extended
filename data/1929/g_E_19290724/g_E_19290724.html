<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Research in Transjordania '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5">RCHEOLOGISTS working in Transjordania have recently discovered the home city of the Prophet Jonah, and have also located the city of Ham, mentioned in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis, along the line of march taken by the kings who captured Lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Airplane Service Across Persia</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE airplane service across Persia has been extended to include a route from Teheran to Bagdad. This makes it possible to go from Europe to Bagdad by two air routes, either via Cairo and Palestine or via Moscow and Baku. The world is getting smaller every hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Accidental Death of a Child</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5"> CORONER’S jury in Manchester, England, brought in a verdict of accidental death in the case of a thirteen-month-old baby whose mother had just fed it, among other things, fried fish, bacon and ham pie. Looks as if there might be something to this diet idea after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">No Longer a Nation of Beef-Eaters</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">B</span><span class="font5">RITAIN is no longer a nation of beef-eaters, as formerly. The consumption of meat has fallen off sharply, salads taking its place. The lighter work of a machine-driven age is causing less and less consumption of heavy foods in many parts of the world. The Italian people are said to be the greatest eaters of green vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God. Seems as if He should be consulted in these matters before blame is laid at His door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">150,000 Jews in Palestine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T^OLLOWING the armistice there were 55,000 -®- Jews in Palestine. The number is now estimated at 149,554. This is the official estimate of the British government, at the close of the year 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Decayed Eggs Useful for Tanning</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">B</span><span class="font5">Y A newly discovered process rotten eggs may now be turned into tannic acid. The joke of it is that the eggs have to reach the worst stage of putrefaction before useful for tanning purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE Northwestern University, Chicago, will this coming fall inaugurate a course of instruction in all the sciences necessary to be understood by a thoroughly first-class detective. It will cooperate with the Chicago Crime Commission.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania’s New Mine Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5">CCORDING to Pennsylvania’s new mine law the main points underground must be kept in touch with the foot of the mine shaft and with the colliery office by telephone. The only remarkable thing about this law is that it Avas not enacted and put in operation forty years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deer Scared the Cook Badly</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5">T DUNCANNON, Pennsylvania, a deer afflicted with wanderlust Swam across the Susquehanna River, wandered over several streets, got into a back yard, became alarmed at something and made a flying jump through a kitchen window, nearly frightening an aged woman to death. The animal escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Why Philadelphia Was Selected</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE first congress of the American colonies was held in Philadelphia because delegates from Georgia and New Hampshire could reach there in eighteen to tAventy days. If the capital of the country were inow in Kansas City, it could be reached from any point in the United States by an airplane trip overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pennsylvania Transportation Services</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE Pennsylvania Railroad is planning transportation services that will enable passengers to go part Avay by rail, part way by airplane, and part way by motor bus, with the railroad in control of all three methods of carriage. Eventually, through tickets will be sold for the combinations desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Compensation of Railroad Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE average number of railroad employes in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1928 Avas 1,680,187, and the total wages paid to them were $2,862,099,609, an average of $1,703. During the year the railroads increased their profits, handling more freight with feAver men. There were 80,812 fewer railroad employes in 1928 than in 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Decreased Use of Coal by Railroads ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A N IMPORTANT factor in the coal situation At the present time the railroads, although actually hauling more freight than in 1920, use only three-fourths as much coal, due to improved methods of fuel use and handling. This decreased use of fuel runs to $100,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Air Services of Vienna</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TTIENNA, though in the heart of an Alpine ’ country, now has fourteen airplane services to various parts of Europe. The fares are cheap: $50 for the 510-mile ride to Rome, the same to Paris, and $30 for the 306-mile ride to Berlin. The latter trip takes only three hours . and forty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Attendance at High Schools</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An interesting phenomenon of the times ■TA i<sub>g</sub> that in the last sixteen years the' attendance at high schools in the United States has more than quadrupled. In 1910 the number of high school pupils was 915,000; now it is almost four millions, with another million in the junior high schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Financiers Greatly Overpaid</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1928 all classes of corporations increased their earnings 17.19 percent. That is too much. But the financial corporations increased their earnings 70 percent over the previous year, and that is very much too much. For the work they do, the great financiers are very much overpaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Alaskan Waters Now Charted</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE United States Coast and Geodetic Survey has completed its charting of Alaskan waters. By an odd coincidence the celebration of this notable achievement was marred by a million-dollar steamer’s being wrecked in Alaskan Avaters. This Avas not the fault of the chartmakers, hoAvever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Penal Colony of French Guiana</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the torrid streets of St. Laurent de Ma-roni two thousand men, some of them conscientious objectors, have been alloAved by the French government to die of starvation. These men are exiles, former prisoners, for &quot;whom no provision is made for their return to their native land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Millions Now Living” Makes a Hit</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE world’s newspaper men seem to have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">caught on to the title of Judge Rutherford’s famous lecture, “Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” In the midst of Britain’s election campaign the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Graphic</span><span class="font5"> came out with a headline clear across its first page reading, “Millions Now Living Are About to Vote.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chicago’s New Beacon</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font5">HICAGO has been offered a new aerial beacon of two billion candle-power, to be located on a 125-foot tower on the roof of a thirty-seven-story building. The beacon, if constructed, will be harder to look at than the sun itself and, it is estimated, will serve as a guide to fliers at a distance of five hundred miles. If erected it will be called the Lindbergh Light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pellagra Not Transmissible</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE United States Public Health Service has proven that pellagra is not transmissible, but is caused by diet deficiency. In our judgment this is the absolute truth and marks the beginning of the end of the serum craze. It is the food one eats and the efficiency of his eliminative powers that determine the condition of his health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Increase in Land Values</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font5">NE of the richest synagogues in New York city recently sold its lot for a profit of a clear million dollars, and the Madison Avenue Methodist Church made $650,000 by moving around the corner and selling its old site for an apartment house. If St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue were to sell out it would make a clear profit of about $10,000,000 on its property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chelsea, World’s Center for Scrap</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font5">HELSEA, Massachusetts, is the world’s center for scrap of all kinds. Old hats are made into rugs, -woolen rags into woolen cloth, other rags into writing paper, old auto tires into tile flooring. Old brass and copper go to Hamburg, and old vests to India. The annual business of some of the junk dealers of Chelsea exceeds a million dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Why Two Strangle-Holds</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ODHE Kansas City </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> wants to know why it</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is that the Power Trust is allowed to have two strangle-holds, a 10% penalty if the payment of the bill is not made instanter and a discontinuance of service if payment is a little longer delayed. We presume the reason why the Power Trust has these strangle-holds and is gladly choking the common people black in the face is because the newspapers are only now waking up to the evils of trusting all the property of the country to the tender mercies of a few groups of heartless capitalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Six Times as Many Cigarettes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO THE shame of American artists, whose best work for years has gone into the glorification of the cigarette, it is claimed that there are now six times as many cigarettes smoked as fourteen years ago. A considerable portion of the increased use has been brought about by the clever advertising which has inveigled women into thinking it is the smart thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Most Profound Loss of World War</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">N</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ewton D. Baker, former secretary of war, declares that the most profound loss of the World War was the loss of faith in the ability of men, by any sort of process, to set up enduring political institutions. This is a very good statement of the fact that humanity has reached the end of its rope and that God’s promised kingdom is its only possible relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Celebration of Tel Aviv</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Tel Aviv, founded on the sand dunes of J- Palestine, has just had its twentieth celebration. It is now a thriving city of 40,000 people. The public address, by the British commissioner of that district, was given entirely in Hebrew. The first child born in Tel Aviv, now a youth of 20, welcomed the guests. Tel Aviv has had but one mayor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font5">N ONE of the boldest, most scathing addresses ever given on the floor of Congress, Representative Rainey is accredited with having used the following remarkable language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;When the Harding administration came on with all its corruption and scandals, when Mr. Daugherty and the Ohio gang were reeking with scandal—many of them have gone to the penitentiary since—it became his duty to suggest who should be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and when the frequenters of the little green house on K Street were able to get together, the only question was who would be most suitable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They agreed on ex-President Taft when they found he was receiving a subsidy from the steel trust. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font4">was elevated then to the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, the greatest court in all the world, and he sits there today drawing his subsidy of $10,000 a year in semi-annual installments from the steel trust, secured by a deposit of steel trust bonds, and he does this in direct violation of his own code of ethics which he himself drew for the American Bar Association and which any of you' can read if you desire to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Night before last, in a sumptuous apartment in the most elegant of Washington hotels, Mr. Taft and Mr. Wickersham, his old attorney-general, both of them responsible for the escape of the sugar trust thieves back in 1910 and 1911, stood shoulder to shoulder and solemnly advised the lawyers of the American Law Institute to go back home and do what they could to enforce the laws.</span></p>

His little scheme worked ail right for a time, but went to pieces when a fellow clerk made a complaint to the government that its stamps were not properly gummed. They investigated, found a quantity of the washed stamps, and now the man who did it is wondering why he did not think of some more honest way to make his income larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">"The Doctor’s Economic Problem”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">IN AN address before the Optometrical Club of Brooklyn, Dr. Shirley W. Wynne, commissioner of health of New York City, is reported to have said, “Here is the necessary solution of the doctor’s economic problem. Let him take in twenty children an hour, one hour a day, three days a week, at a charge of $5.00 for each anti-diphtheria inoculation. This will bring a revenue worth while to the doctor.” Can you beat it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To this recipe for picking up a little easy money, no matter how hard it may be for the frightened and long-suffering parents, should be added the interesting information that in checking over an epidemic of diphtheria among the nurses at the Cook County Hospital in Illinois, last fall, more cases of diphtheria developed among those who had had toxin anti-toxin than among those who had not had it. As the light of truth on all subjects spreads it looks more and more as if the medical doctors are in for a bad time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The archbishop of York reasons as follows on war, and it is interesting to see the means by which he. convinces himself that what is absolutely wrong is absolutely right. He said: “War remains absolutely wrong and only relatively right: but that will not perplex any one who has grasped the elementary logical principle that relative terms are in their relations absolute, and, therefore, if it is right in the circumstances, it is in the circumstances absolutely right.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">WHAT the War Department wishes may be gathered from the bill introduced in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">House of Representatives, in Washington, at its request, in the spring of 1929. This bill has plenty of sharp teeth in every paragraph, but plenty of loopholes for bishops, priests and millionaires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bill, if enacted into law, would demand the registration of all males between the ages of 18 and 45, under penalty of imprisonment, and after their imprisonment they would be registered anyway, automatically. Those registered would be subject to martial law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">High government officials would be exempted, and the president could also exempt such “regularly ordained ministers of religion”, minor officials, and persons engaged in essential industries, as he might see fit. There ■would be no other’ exemptions on account of occupation or religious beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Members of “'any well-recognized religious sect whose creed or principles forbid its members to participate in Avar in any form” would be required to render noncombatant service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who have declared their intention of becoming citizens would be able, under certain conditions, to withdraw their intention and thus be relieved from liability to military service, but such persons would by such act be for ever barred from becoming citizens of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Defeat of Drake and Alair</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">WO gallant men have gone down in defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First, there was Admiral Drake. In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> No. 238 he produced for the delectation of our readers what he thought and what we thought was a very long word. Let’s see! If we remember right, it was “antiinterdenomina-tionalistically”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then a little while ago along came General Alair with a still longer word, “proantitransub-stantiationalistically,” and we all acknowledged that he had triumphed over friend Drake. But little did General Alair know what was coming, nor did we.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The trouble that has come on these two dictionary fighters is now in its last stage, FieldMarshal Boy Van Le Cair, of Michigan, has risen up in his might and taken a clipping from his </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">National Geographic Magazine</span><span class="font5"> for March, 1920. In that clipping, which is right in front, of us, the geographer mentions in the most matter of fact way . a little lake on the border of Connecticut. We hesitate to pronounce it, but it reads: Lake Chaugogagogmanchaugagogchau-hunagungamaug. If it had not been for those last four letters Alair would have been all right. As it is, he is gone. Somehow, the name of this lake makes a man feel that he has discovered the real reason why our ancestors killed off the Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Events in Canada </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Our Canadian Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">S</span><span class="font5">PEAKING of Canada as the best customer of the United States, and its rival for wealth, Mr. Lynn W. Meekins, United States commercial attache at Ottawa, when addressing the sixteenth national foreign trade convention of that country, said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canada is our best customer because it needs our products and has ample resources with which to pay for them. It is a close second to the United States in per capita wealth and income.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With less than 10,000,000 people Canada has many more than 1,000,000 motor vehicles and 500,000 radio sets—impressive evidence of the large buying power of our good neighbors. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The estimated wealth of Canada is in the neighborhood of $27,000,000,000, and its aggregate annual income is not far from $6,000,000,000. About three million Canadians are employed in gainful occupations. These producers have an average stake of $9,000 in their country in the form of actually developed natural resources, land, buildings, implements, machinery, automobiles, investments and cash, and in addition to that an average annual income of $2,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canadians are prosperous. Their recent progress is remarkable. Between 1925 and 1928 their annual production increased by $1,000,000,000, or 20 per cent, in three years. If they continue at that rate we shall have to hustle to keep up with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Traffic of the Great Lakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Toronto </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font5"> contained the following interesting editorial upon the greatness of the Great Lakes traffic:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magnitude of the freight traffic on the upper lakes is seen when the traffic using the Soo canal is compared with the traffic passing through the Suez and Panama canals in the year 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The canals between the Indian ocean and the Mediterranean and between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans carried more freight last year than ever before, but the combined tonnage of their traffic was only 75.7 per cent, of the, traffic passing between Lakes Superior and Huron. The figures, now available for the first time, are as follows: Suez canal, 32,622,000 tons; Panama canal, 33,186,394 tons; Soo canal, 86,933,000 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total quantity of freight carried on the upper lakes was appreciably greater than 86 million tons. That figure does not include the tonnage carried into and out of Lake Michigan nor a lot of local traffic between lake ports. The saving in freight rates effected by using cheap water transportation on the upper lakes instead of rail transportation, amounts to more than 200 million dollars yearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great increase in the economics of water transportation would be made if deep water were carried from the great lakes eastward to Montreal, making a continuous water highway between the five lakes and the seven seas. But Canada, after spending 115 millions on the most expensive part of the extension eastward, one which will not bring benefits commensurate with its cost unless the rest of the work is done, seems to have forgotten what it is she intended to do. The losses occasioned to her people by this state of amnesia or mental aberration will reach many millions of dollars per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The explanation usually given for Canada’s uncertain course in regard to the provision of deep navigation on the St. Lawrence river is that her politicians lack decisiveness. But a truer explanation is that her business interests, for all their reputation for alertness, have failed to make adequate representations to those who make public sentiment and mold governmental policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Exploration by Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Canadian fliers are adding to the aerial maps of this country at the rate of some 66,000 square miles a year, according to Mr. N. C. Stewart, Victoria surveyor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“These maps are not taken for any mere scenic record, although they would be well worth while for that alone,” said Mr. Stewart. “The maps are used for tracing mineral deposits, oil and timber resources, locating transportation routes, range land and water courses. The airplane is giving Canada the best opportunity she has ever had of studying herself and finding out just how wealthy her resources really are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the caption “Exploring by Air” the Saskatoon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star Phoenix</span><span class="font5"> editorially states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a recent convention an internationally known Canadian mining engineer and a deputy minister of the federal government spoke casually of hundreds of thousands of miles of almost unexplored wilderness which have been covered by airplane. This work is typical of the Canadian air service. While United States fliers have been staging spectacular endurance flights immediately over airdromes or across well mapped country, and while Great Britain has specialized in speed records, Canadian airmen have engaged in stupendous commercial tasks, doing their work quietly, almost unknown to the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The air mail service in Canada is fairly well known through official statements. Commercial flying is looked upon as a matter of course. Even the work of the forestry patrol in covering huge territories by plane is familiar to Canadians. But in that, vast stretch of country in the north part of the prairie provinces there has gone forward a work of far greater</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">GOLDEN' AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">er importance than airmail or passenger-carrying between cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not so many years since the prairie country of Western Canada was looked upon as a tract unfit for human habitation. So it has been with respect to the northern ‘hinterland.’ But within the last year or two there has been a change. Prospectors, conveyed by airplane, have penetrated to every corner of this country hitherto regarded as barren land. Through the efforts of these men and the airmen, Canada is beginning to realize that there lies an empire equal if not superior to that which was developed by the western penetration of the railways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Peaceful Industrial Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The flour production and flour exportation of Canada keeps on the increase. During 1928 the production amounted to 19,349,000 barrels, compared with 17,701,000 barrels in 1927, according to the Bureau of Statistics. Exports during the year amounted to 10,737,266 barrels, valued at $63,973,066, as compared with 9,262,936 barrels at $60,266,510 in 1927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Speaking upon the peaceable condition prevailing in the industrial life of this country at present the Saskatoon </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star Phoenix</span><span class="font5"> has the following to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Canada has been fairly free of serious industrial trouble in recent years. The loss of time due to strikes and lockouts in the Dominion last year was 238,132 working days. On the face of it that seems serious enough, but the figure is one of the lowest recorded since statistics began to be kept in 1900. The peak of industrial trouble in Canada was 1919, when 3,942,189 working days were lost. The average thereafter until 1925 was well above one million, and approached two million in 1922,1924 and 1925. By comparison the record for last year is distinctly encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The decline in the number of serious disputes is due to several causes. Among these the most important is undoubtedly the fact that industrial workers in Canada enjoy a higher standard of living now than ever before. Prices have declined from the peak level of the post-war years to a point about 55 per cent, higher than the 1913 scale. Wages have not come down simultaneously. They stand at between 80 and 90 per cent, above pre-war standards. In terms of buying power the factory employees of Canada are much better off than they were fifteen or ten years ago. Increased production and improved methods of manufacture enable employers to pay the relatively high wages now prevailing. There is no pressure on the workers to accept lower rates; so wage disputes, the most potent cause of strikes, are remarkably rare. That is one reason for the good strike record of 1928. Another is that employers and workers, not to mention the citizens generally, have come round to the view that the strike and lockout are wasteful weapons and should be held in reserve for use as a last resold, and not regarded as the normal method of settling arguments about wages, hours and working conditions. There is nowadays a marked tendency to resort to conciliation and compromise. Legislation providing for arbitration has been a useful safeguard of industrial peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Slaughter of the Innocents </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By L. G. Manchester</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font5">N READING a report in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font5">that seventy percent of New York’s children are defective, and eighty-five percent of Chicago’s children, we must all realize that this terrible condition is only of very recent years. How can it be otherwise? The streets are just lined with M.D. poison squirters. They are seen everywhere with grips full of the most deadly poisons and needles for injecting them. This they do to every child they can corner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without doubt the fifteen and thirty percent found O.K. are in most cases those who have escaped the poison squad. First, there is the M.D. vaccinating mania. Then comes an antitoxin for other excuses, etc., until the children are full of the most deadly poisons known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Added to this is the fact that they are compelled to drink milk from cows that have also been subjected to a liberal injection of tuberculin, a most terrible deadly poison. This poison enters directly into the blood circulation. Hence the milk. Then this milk is sterilized, or scalded to the boiling point or nearly so, destroying much of the life-giving nourishment of the milk, but not injuring the poison therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Scalded milk, for either adults or children, is very constipating. This in turn causes more deaths and resulting ailments than do all other causes combined, I surely believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Oh, how badly we need the kingdom! I certainly believe the fulfilling of the slaughter of the innocents is now taking place, right before our eyes; and were the time of trouble to be long continued there would surely be no flesh saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christianity and Citizenship</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">B</span><span class="font5">Y A majority vote the Supreme Court decided that the United States of America is a Christian country, and now by another majority vote it has decided, in substance, that a man can not be a real Christian and be an acceptable citizen of this same United States. This necessarily makes us what we are, a nation of hypocrites, like every other professed Christian nation under the sun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new decision declares, “That it is the duty of citizens by force of arms to defend our government against all enemies whenever necessity arises is a fundamental principle of the Constitution.” This leaves no room for the pacifist; but if our conception is correct it leaves no room' for the power trust either, though we do not think there is any immediate danger of a declaration of war by this government against that particular trust, nor against any other of the abominations that desolate the Western world. The. opinion proceeds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whatever tends to lessen the willingness of citizens </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> discharge their duty to bear arms in the country’s defense detracts from the strength and the safety of the government. And their opinions and their beliefs as well as their behavior indicating a disposition to hinder in the performance of that duty are subject to inquiry under the statutory provisions governing naturalization and are of vital importance, for if all or a large number of citizens opposed such defense, the good order and happiness of the United States can not long endure. . . . The influence of conscientious objectors against the use of military force in the defence of the principles of our government is apt to be more detrimental than their mere refusal to bear arms. ...

<p><span class="font5">' Japanese Kudzu</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">O</span><span class="font5">NE of the most wonderful pasture plants known to the South is “Japanese Kudzu”; but we have until recently been ignorant of its merits as such. Kudzu is a legume and uses the same inoculation as cow peas; hence it will grow vigorously anywhere in the South, if planted on well-drained soil. No other known plant will so completely dominate all other growth and take charge of the soil. It will even smother trees and succeed them, when once it gets well established. Our poor, red, rocky, gullied hills, once they are set in Kudzu, will graze more livestock to the acre than any other pasture plant known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This vine is perennial in its growth (needs to be planted but once) and will smother out Bermuda, nutgrass, and even wild onions, when once it is well established. It gets its nitrogen from the air and needs only “acid” and kainite (or other form of potash), and is one of the best known plants for stopping gullies and making “waste lands” pay a good profit instead of hang-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By W. H. Barton</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing like a black pall on our tax liabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been known to “run” 50 to 100 feet in -one season; and each year’s growth remains alive like grape vines, and as soon as the land is matted with such a growth, the rapid growth of side runners (which grow erect) furnishes an amazing amount of green grazing that tastes better to a cow than probably any other green growth known to the “Bossie” family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the best methods of establishing Kudzu is to plant it five to ten feet apart each way, fertilize, and cultivate for one season to keep down other growth until the vines can cover the land. Then graze only lightly for the first year, and ever afterward. Divide the area into halves and alternate the grazing; let stock graze one to two weeks at a time on each half. This will about double the capacity of its grazing, and will keep the plant more vigorous. Only two-year-old Kudzu roots should be planted. Any thing younger than that is liable to die when transplanted.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font5">Within a recent issue Of your valued magazine, I read where one poor reader Made quite a startling scene Because he left his topcoat A hanging in its place And thought to dress like women Who can wear thin clothes with grace. Now, if this same good reader Would read again that page He said he read beforehand In a previous </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age, </span><span class="font5">He’d find ’twas ’indoor garments’ It suggested leaving off, And not a needed topcoat In cold weather he should doff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now I have often wondered</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why the men all choked up go In white, stiff, starched, high collars; And I’d also like to know</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The good of vests and woolen coats On good hot summer day, Or even in the winter, If indoors it’s sixty-eight.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">I think, though, they are learning, If my observation’s bright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know a stylish shirt-house That’s making those things right. They’re making up some dress shirts With the bodies all of voile, And other shirts with collars That lie flat and will not soil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Educational Graft </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Gerald W. Johnson </span><span class="font3">[Reprinted from Baltimore </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun]</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is in Cleveland, Ohio, an organization called the Association for Retrenchment in Public Expenditures which has been broadcasting some startling facts and figures. Recently it has issued a pamphlet with the suggestive title “Sanctified Squander” in which headlong attack is made on the whole American conception of popular education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It- quotes Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, as saying: “The striking characteristic of our schools under the process of enrichment of the curriculum is superficiality, coupled with tremendously rising cost.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About the tremendously rising cost there is no doubt. The United States Bureau of Education reports that in 1890 it cost the country $140,000,000 to teach 12,000,000 school children, while in 1925 teaching twice as many children cost fourteen times as much, or just under $2,-000,000,000. Nor is there any doubt about the enrichment of the curriculum. The parent who received his college diploma ten years ago today is frequently unable to understand even the names of many of the subjects required of modern school children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, of the third factor, the superficiality which Dr. Pritchett alleges is characteristic of modern education? He elaborates the charge in these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Education in the elementary schools, instead of meaning a thorough grounding in fundamentals, means a smattering of many things, some of them important, some of them pleasant, and many of them mediocre and trivial. Intellectual discipline has been notably weakened, and the school system has come to be looked upon as the door by which every boy and girl is to enter into some kind of calling that may afford the means of making a living.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the support of the argument the Ohio bulletin brings a host of authorities. For example, President Butler, of Columbia, is quoted as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“'The ability to read has well nigh disappeared if the reading be serious, instructive, or ennobling; the ability to write, so far as it exists at all, delights to manifest itself in forms of exceptional crudeness and vulgarity; the ability to perform the simplest mathematical operations is, to all intents and purposes, confined to</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">teachers of mathematics or to specialists in that’ subject.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then there is Dr. William M. Thornton, of the University of Virginia, lamenting that the colleges and universities are being filled with students, “the majority of whom can neither read intelligently, nor write respectably, nor spell correctly, nor compute as accurately as an ordinary grocer’s clerk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And President R. M. Hughes, of Miami University, is declared to have said recently that pupils are graduated from high schools who do not know arithmetic, cannot write and cannot even read understandingly a page of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are others, all lamenting that the pupil’s school days are being spent in something other than learning to read, to write and to compute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately the question arises, To whose interests is it to divert the pupil’s time and attention from the things he really needs and squander them upon trifling subjects? To this question the Ohio organization make a reply sufficiently appalling. It points out that there are embedded in our educational system innumerable “experts” who must perpetually be making a show of doing something to our educational system in order to hold their jobs. Furthermore, there are commercial organizations making countless devices for use in the schools and these are always introducing new things. Finally, there are political teachers and politicians who specialize in school support and it is necessary to supply jobs for them and for their hangers-on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other w’ords, there is a very large economic interest in the expansion of the schools, not only physically but as regards the curriculum. Every time a new subject is introduced there is a new job, new equipment to be sold, perhaps a new classroom-do be built and considerable profit to be made. Consequently the schools are expanding beyond all reason, and to the damage of pupils and taxpayers alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now, this may be disguised under all sorts of dignified names, but at the bottom it is plain, ordinary graft. The gravamen of the charge of the Association for Retrenchment in Public Expenditures is that a large proportion of the American money being spent ostensibly for education is really spent for graft. More than that, the children are being cheated out of the intel-</span><span class="font1">685</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lectual training they have a right to expect for vantage of parents’ unselfish devotion to their the expenditures of their parents’ money. children’s welfare in order to rob the parents Incidentally, this makes it about the lowest is shameful. But to take advantage of it to rob form of graft known to politics. To take ad- the children also is the lowest infamy imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Few Hints to Foremen </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Isaiah Hale</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TpOREMEN are seldom or never eye-witness--F cs to injuries, but a far more important fact is that they too often fail to see an injury in the making; they fail to see a workman doing something today which their experience ought to tell them will, if repeated, result in an injury to some tomorrow, and to stop the practice before and not after an injury occurs. Following this thought, so firmly am I convinced that it is the exceptional supervisor who has even a reasonably clear understanding and appreciation of the responsibilities and privileges of foremanship, that I imagine when they were called into the “inside office” and told they were to be made a foreman, while some of them knew they had been struck by Opportunity, they did not know just where or why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later, and still in a daze and wondering what it was all about, I imagine they turned to a dictionary to learn what a “foreman” really is. Among other things, they found a foreman is an “overseer”; all very interesting, but what is an overseer? Turning a few pages, they found an overseer is “one who oversees”; following their quest, they found that one who oversees is “one who overlooks,” and so from that day to this they have been overlooking things they ought to have seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is high time managements began, to realize the different levels of intelligence in men, and be more discriminating in taking new men into their service. You have all read during the World War that out of the 1,700,000 young Americans given a psychological test, 70% of them were given the mental rating of a child fourteen years of age, and that 45% of that number, or 31% of the entire total 'were rated by our government experts as “morons”—a “moron” being defined as a “person not mentally capable of complete self guidance.” A man applies to many of'you, looking for work; you take his chest expansion and note his back-muscle development, and if it compares favorably with a prize-fighter or wrestler you hire him even though he has not the brain capacity of a jumbo peanut. On the other hand, if you were considering the purchase of a piece of machinery at $25,000 or $30,000 there would be no end of conferences and analyses to make sure the new machine was worth its cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Roger W. Babson, recognized as an eminent authority on the subjects he discusses, said not long ago, “Only one man in fifty in America ever thinks; only one in five hundred ever originates anything, even an idea, that is worth anything to himself or anybody else; and at the age of fifty years, 53½% of the male population of America are down and out, have quit cold, and are living on the bounty of relatives, friends or some charitable organization.” Rather a sad commentary, I would say, on our much vaunted civilization and intelligence when we are told that at fifty years, at what ought to be the best years in any man’s life, 53½% of us are through. Do you know why these men have quit ? They’ve quit, most of them, because they never tried; they never tried because they never cared, and they never cared because they never had the right sort of influence from men like you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I would have you earn, and earning get, and getting, hold the respect, the confidence and the friendship of your men; find them coming to you with their petty personal problems, that some day you might feel the cockles of your heart warmed by that thrill, comparable to which there is no other, the thrill that comes from reaching down a helping hand to some poor devil who is in a rut, and who, down in his heart, wants nothing quite so much as a pat on the back, a kindly word of encouragement from his boss that he now too seldom gets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Releasing the Power of the Atom</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5"> FARMER’S boy near Frankfort, Indiana, is said to have succeeded in splitting an atom. The first time the current was turned on it released so much power that the automobile in which it was installed leaped ahead and went through the side of a building, destroying the machine and generator and nearly making an end of the inventor, Howard Martin. He is now engaged in building a new generator, essentially a bar surrounded by a complicated network of wires. Beware the Power Trust if they get this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A writer in the Edinburgh (Scotland) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Dispatch,</span><span class="font5"> discussing the possibilities of released atomic energy and correlated subjects says:.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The consequences of this liberation of energy will be almost inconceivable. There is more than enough power in a pint of water to drag the heaviest railway train from London to Edinburgh. A bath full of water would drive a liner from Liverpool to New York. A few thousand tons of water (far less than fills an ordinary dock) would provide enough energy to level all the mountains of Scotland, or to remove Wales from her present position into the middle of the. Bay of Biscay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Think of engines weighing one ounce for each horse power they develop; of electricity so cheap that an ordinary household’s electric light and heating bill for a year will amount to a shilling; of huge ships where engine rooms are as small as your bath room: these are a few of the possibilities which the release of intra-molecular energy will bring in its train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This new energy will enable us to alter the geography and climate of the world at will. By artificial heating the polar regions could easily be turned into pleasant winter resorts. The Sahara might become a calm inland sea—a second Mediterranean—surrounded by smiling fertile shores. The arid centre of Australia might be transformed into a huge garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are not fanciful dreams; each one of them is within the immediate scope of engineering ingenuity. But, because power is at present so costly, their achievement wnuld swallow up a great part of the world’s wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. Armed with cheap power, however, the engineers of the future will be able to carry them out as economic propositions. That is to say, the benefits derived from such improvements to the earth’s geography and climate will more than repay the cost of making them. Some scientists, however, believe that the solution of the power problem will be reached through harnessing the tides. The tides of the Bristol Channel could provide all the power needed to run the industries</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of the Midlands. Once harnessed, the tides of the Firth of Forth could generate far more electricity than Scotland could at present consume. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no need for the world to wait for abundant cheap electricity. The man with enough vision, organising power, and command of finance could start to work solving the power problem of Britain tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But there is a reverse side to this rosy picture of a world from which drudgery has been abolished. The coming of plentiful power costing only nominal sums, wall mean the utter decay and collapse of coalmining. Coal will no longer be of any use to the world; and lumps of it will be preserved in museums, under glass cases, along with bows and arrows, armour, and other relics of a barbarous past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The consequences of this will be extraordinarily serious to Britain. The export of coal remains one of our principal national sources of wealth. By coal’s aid we pay for a large proportion of all the food, cotton, wool, and the thousand and one other kinds of goods which we must import or perish. If coal became as valueless as mud, Britain would be faced with a new set of circumstances which so far as we can see to-day Would mean bankruptcy and ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Can science promise any solution for this problem, which she will raise by destroying the importance of coal? Many scientists of the highest repute believe that she can. Biology, they declare, will come to the rescue, by making synthetic food-stuffs practicable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At present we nourish ourselves in a rather curious manner. All the food value in most vegetation (grass, leaves, &amp;c.) consists of cellulose, which is totally indigestible by human beings. Animals, however, can digest cellulose and extract nourishment from it. So we keep large herds of animals, feeding ourselves to a large extent on their milk and meat, which we can digest. The animals, in fact, are a sort of living laboratories, which transform indigestible cellulose into nourishing beef, mutton, pork, and milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Biologists and chemists believe that in the not very distant future they will be able to imitate the activities of cows and sheep, and tranform cellulose into synthetic beefsteak or mutton broth in their laboratories. When they can do so on a commercial scale, Britain will become a self-supporting country, able to feed all the millions of her inhabitants without importing a single bushel of wheat or carcase of mutton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nor need we fear that our great-grandchildren will find their synthetic meals dull and nasty. The chemical foods of the twenty-first century will be far and away more delicious than our present diet. Not only will scientists be able exactly to imitate the flavours of natural foods, but they will also invent new and pleasant flavours unknown to nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Impressions of Latvia </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By D. L. Cranston</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19290724_files/g_E_19290724-5.png" alt="" style="width:234pt;height:252pt;">
<p><span class="font1">THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">□Toward the end of the 18th century that -®- portion of country now called Latvia was forcibly taken possession of by the old Russian Empire. Since that time, and until 1918, it was exploited to the full. With the fall of the old czarist regime, and the termination of the great World War, Latvian independence was proclaimed. The new republic commenced in an impoverished condition and during troublous times. That for ten years this little republic has continued to maintain its existence and make some progress is to the credit of her statesmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Readers of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> are cognizant of the fact that the period since 1918 has been one of political and financial corruption throughout the world. During that period hypocrisy, fraud and deceit have gone to seed, and no nation today is untainted. Latvia is, in this respect, akin to all other nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is possible for a country to make progress as a nation, and to improve its standing among other nations, without having accomplished any real progress. The success and health of a state should be measured by the contentment and happiness of its people. The people of Latvia are very discontented. Their standard of living is low, and their conditions even worse than under the old Russian Empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning, the socialist influence in the government was powerful. It has gradually become less so. About November, 1928, a new government went into office. It is decidedly conservative and reactionary. It stands for the protection of the church denominations. In Latvia, as in other countries, the financiers, politicians and clergy go hand in hand. This is a combination always against the interests of the common people. It is of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the days of the old Russian Empire, Latvians were not permitted to acquire a higher education or enter any municipal vocation. Only those who could afford to travel abroad could obtain such an education. As a result there was practically no Latvian bourgeoisie in those days. Since 1918 a bur-geois class has come into existence, gradually becoming more powerful. These are the oneswhose interests are served by the government. To them the Latvian republic has been a success. To the common people it is, and has been, a failure.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19290724_files/g_E_19290724-6.png" alt="" style="width:113pt;height:249pt;">
<p><span class="font1">IN A WES</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The coinage system is based on the American $ system. Most of the motor cars are American. Like America, it is a republic. In many ways it seeks to imitate the great American republic, but not always with good success. In one respect it has attained a splendid likeness. That is, in its claim that it is democratic. They talk much about democracy and make great claims. The American people do the same for America. Democracy means a rule by the people for the people. In America democracy is dead. It has as much life in Latvia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Latvia is an agricultural country. Throughout the world farming is no longer a paying business. The Latvian government brought out new agrarian laws so that the people now possess the land. But it does not pay very well to work it. The Latvians, who compose 75.6 per-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">cent of the population, are engaged in 80.2 percent of the agriculture. The Jews (4.5 percent) and the Germans (3.3 percent) are engaged in one percent of the agriculture. Agriculture is the source of the nation’s wealth. The Latvians are engaged in 37.47 percent of the trade, the Jews in 40.7 percent, and the Germans in 12.24 percent. This means that 7.8 percent of the population, Jews and Germans, control 52.95 percent of the country’s trade, while the Lat</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ERN STATE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">vians control only 37.4 percent. The vast majority of the Latvians are poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a lack of capital in Latvia. Foreign capital is invited. Foreign capital plays a large part in Latvian finance and industry. To invite capital, the policy of the country must be conservative and in the interests of capital. The common people can not, therefore, hope for any betterment f r o m this new republic. Their hope is in the establishment of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people of Latvia are hard-working. They do the work, and a few traders, mostly Jews,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">reap the profit of their labors. For a long time these good people have been oppressed, longing for deliverance. They thought this would be brought to them by the new republic. Now, after ten years, they are disappointed and discontented. No betterment has come. They rid themselves of one set of taskmasters now, to have others equally as harsh and oppressive. Will conditions always be thus? Is there no hope of better conditions and better times? Can the financiers bring any betterment? No; they have their own selfish aims to pursue. Can the politicians? No; they have the financiers to serve and please. Can the clergy? No; they walk hand in hand with the oppressors of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is a small band of people who proclaim throughout the earth a message of good news. Are they financiers? No. Are they politicians? No. Are they clergymen? No. Who are they, then, and by what authority do they proclaim their message of good news?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord Jesus . said that, following the World War, this message of good news should be proclaimed in all the world as a witness, and that His faithful followers should do this. It is the good news that the time for the establishment of God’s kingdom has come. To His people Jehovah says, &quot;Ye are my witnesses that I am God.” God has permitted mankind to be oppressed for centuries. He.has also permitted His own good name to be dishonored as a result thereof. The time for the deliverance of the people and the honoring of God’s name has come. Jehovah commissions His people to proclaim this good news to the people. God is the true friend of the people. He will bring deliverance. The time for His kingdom and for the overthrow of man’s great oppressor, Satan, is here. God's kingdom will bring to the people peace, prosperity and happiness. This can be secured in no other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is, therefore, a bright future for the people of Latvia. The new republic of Latvia is a failure. God’s kingdom will be a huge success.</span></p>

Several were sick in the afternoon, and a boy who ate heartily of the same food at supper-time nearly died during the night. Another lad who ate but one meal of this food was not nearly so sick as the other one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems to me that in Louisiana “Jehu” is started on his famous ride. Last election, it seems, a young man came out and ran for governor as the people’s friend. He went after them so earnestly that he won against the ring of New Orleans and the Standard Oil crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His campaign promised great things: free books for the school children, good roads with no additional cost, reforms in the penitentiary and in the asylums, and a chance for the old people to learn to read and write. And, lo, he began to do the things promised, and is progressing in spite of all odds by the “unholy trinity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When he proposed a small tax on the gas and oil of the state, the politicians, preachers and papers suddenly found out that he was everything that a governor should not be, so they went to work overtime to put him out of office, and it looked for a while as if they would succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He went to work and had mass meetings and radio talks all over the state, and reassured himself and all the people that the people were with him; so he finally won out, and will retain his office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those senators who have been untrue to the people will have to give an account of themselves. The people are circulating petitions in several places to have a reelection, so as to have them recalled.

<p><span class="font5">to sign it and send in their requests to have their names scratched off the petitions. The governor has demanded that there be no scratching of names off the petitions. So we see the fight is on to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one of his addresses over the radio the governor told about a pious-faced fraud coming to his office to have an interview with him and wanting to pray for him. The governor told him that he needed the prayers of all good people, but wanted to be as good to him as he himself had proposed to be, so he. read to him the parable of the sheep and goats, and showed the fraud that he (the governor) was taking stand for those people who could not help themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The governor then invited the false shepherd to take a stand for the people, and the poor scarecrow of a man said that if he did his people would run him out of towm. The governor told him that if they would run him out for a thing like that he ought to let them do it, and then told him that he thought the preacher ought to be prayed for as much as or more than he himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">. Taxes, Vaccination, Inoculation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(By Dr. G. R. Clements, Editor, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">How To Live</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font5">HE taxpayers and voters of Arkansas are busy. They have been good citizens, paid their taxes and supported their government. They have watched a growth of 236 percent in taxation since 1912. That is too much; and too much is enough for them. They are now telling their legislators that the day of retribution is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An investigation disclosed the amazing fact that the largest part of the increase had resulted from the activity of the medical profession in that state, in lobbying bills through the legislature from year to year, making appropriations from state funds for health boards and health officers, for vaccines and serums, for hospitals and their up-keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As vaccination and inoculation grew apace under the activity of health officers, many new and mysterious diseases appeared. Then came more bills asking for more appropriations of state funds for use in studying the new and mysterious diseases, and in discovering cures for them. It was much like a snowball rolling down hill: the farther it rolls, the larger it grows. But the bottom of the hill seems to have been reached, and the sun is now going to shine on that snowball.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scheme works partly like this: State legislatures are told that vaccination and inoculation, carried out generally, will prevent disease. How absurd! Just as though the medical profession could survive without disease. The other part of the scheme, according to statements recently made by the president of the Illinois Medical Society, works like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That prevention (vaccination and inoculation) practised to its utmost will create more work for the physician, and not diminish it, for the full-time health officer will be educating his community constantly (the children mainly—for early impressions are lasting ones), so that there will be more and more immunizing and use of the physician, and that it was his opinion that epidemics, endemics, and infections cause only 12 percent of all deaths, and that this percentage is declining rapidly, due to sanitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He later admitted that—■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only 15 percent of all children would ever get diphtheria, even under epidemic conditions, while 100 percent are prospects for toxin anti-toxin; that the percentage who would ever get smallpox under present conditions is even less, but 100 per cent are prospects for vaccination, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Guy L. Keifer, M. D., health commissioner of Michigan, recently made the following statement in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the Michigan State Medical Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the 100,000 people born every year in Michigan are vaccinated against smallpox at birth, the income to the physicians would approximate $200,000. The 500 cases of smallpox that occur every year, treated at an average of $50 per case, brings physicians $25,000. Thus the physicians, by adopting the practice of vaccination at birth, would increase their income by nearly $200,000 (p. 528).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There you are, direct from medical sources. And now do you know how smallpox vaccine virus is made? A calf is tied down to a table, its abdomen is shaved from 12 to 15 inches square, then about 100 gashes with a knife are made in the quivering flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The seed virus, the origin of which no medical institution can tell, is rubbed into these bleeding wounds, the poison enters the blood and is carried all over the body of the suffering animal, corrupting and polluting its blood, glands, organs, and tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fever and inflammation now arise, as the body struggles against the poison, and the calf becomes very sick. In a few days the wounds become ulcerated and pus is discharged therefrom, as the body strives to eliminate the poison, then scabs form over these pus-oozing wounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In about six days the process of elimination has progressed so far that the wounds are filled with pus, putrid cells, and other decayed and poisonous matter. Over this reservoir of filth is a firm scab.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The calf is once more bound to the table; the inoculated area is washed with water, and each vesicle is clasped with clamps, separately. The scab is carefully scraped off, and the pus, putrid cells, and poisonous matter that exude from the wounds, are caught and transferred to a small crucible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To this poisonous mass an equal measure of glycerine is added, then the admixture of corruption is stirred with a small electric motor until it becomes homogeneous, after which it is placed in another crucible and passed through a sieve, in order to remove the coarse pieces of rotten flesh, scabs, putrid cells, hair, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mass is well stirred again, then transferred to tubes, and is now ready for use</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">through the land, under the guise of “pure calf lymph”. It requires much magic, faith, and medical propaganda to transform putrid pus into pure lymph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the nauseous, loathsome, diseasespreading filth that health boards, school boards, and family physicians insist upon injecting into the blood of helpless children and deceived adults, in order to “protect them from disease”. In fact, in order that children may enter schools, colleges, and universities, and that adults may work in some places of employment, may travel, or go abroad, they are compelled to submit to the injection of this disease-breeding filth into their blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One reputable physician, whose name we are asked not to give, reports that of 400 cases of cancer treated by him, every one had a history of vaccination behind it, and that he has never treated an unvaccinated person for that disorder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">E. Pollard, M, I)., medical inspector of the Government Board in England, published a pamphlet on vaccination, in which he admitted that of 46 children vaccinated by him, 39 developed syphilis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The taxpayers and voters of Arkansas have decided to resist these medical outrages. They have presented to their legislature a bill, which begins as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An act to make no form of medical remedy, surgical operation, vaccination, or inoculation a condition precedent to admission of any person to any public or private school, college or university, or for the exercise of any right, the performance of any duty, or the enjoyment of any privilege by any person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course this bill has caused a big hubbub among medical men of that state, and they are vigorously circulating a petition against it. Why? Get your ansvrer in what Dr. Keif er said above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When will other states fall in line with Arkansas? The time has come for every state to throw off the medical yoke. Compulsory medication, vaccination, and inoculation have reached the limit. Free-born American people will submit to the tyrant no longer. Legislators had better listen, or they will hear the voice and feel the vote of the taxpayers of their respective states.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rilllE GOLDEN 'AGE</span><span class="font5"> has previously called •A attention to the fact that Albert W. Peacock, Milford, N. H., has been punished by fine and imprisonment because he refuses to allow his son to be vaccinated. Vaccination is illegal in Leicester, England, and in Chicago, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every day the Peacock boy is made ready for school, and every day is refused admittance because not vaccinated. Now see the following clipping from the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sun Telegraph</span><span class="font5"> to show the unbelievable meanness and smallness of soul to which men will resort when they wish to poison the public mind. We do not know who put this message in the form in which it was printed in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span><span class="font5"> and other papers, but we can guess. They are “guilty of failing to permit” the facts to be made known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">VACCINATION REBEL JAILED</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Milford, N. H., Dee. 22—Declaring himself a &quot;martyr to the cause of anti-vaccination,’'' Albert W. Peacock, of this town, has started to serve a 236 days ’ sentence in the Hillsborough county jail after refusing to pay a fine of $10 and costs of $100, imposed when he was found guilty of failing to permit his son to attend public school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have had the above item standing in type for some time. Now, after the lapse of six months, we are glad to be able to tell our readers that Mr. Peacock has been pardoned by the governor. It seems likely at this writing, however, that the family will have to leave the state, as the supreme court of the state has decided the vaccination issue in the manner desired by the American Medical Association, and medical liberty in New Hampshire is nil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Until now we did not know that Mr. Peacock is a reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and that his wife is very deeply interested in the cause for which we stand. It seems that the real liberty-lovers in the United States are simmering down to a handful and that the rest are as innocent of individuality and as subservient to those whose banner is the dollar mark as if they first opened their eyes yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Torment for Torment’s Sake</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font5">HEN we look over the instruments of the inquisition for dislocating joints, tearing nerves and mangling sensitive parts of the human body; when we think of Calvin’s arrangement for slowly baking Servetus by a fire built far enough away that he lingered in agony for five hours, and when we think of some of the tortures which have been applied to negroes in various parts of the United States in recent years, we try to think that those things are all in the past and that they will never occur again. But alas! some of the most highly educated men in the world are daily engaged in torment for torment’s sake. They call it vivisection. These torments are applied to dogs, cats, and sometimes to the babies of the poor. In some undefined way science is supposed to be benefited by seeing just how far tortures may go before death mercifully intervenes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Curare is a drug obtained from derivatives of the Strychnos family. Three centuries ago certain South American Indians tipped their arrows with it. When wounded with this “poison of the living death”, as it has been described, the victim’s senses and entire sensitivity remain intact, so that it suffers hours of agony, but without the ability to move a muscle, not even an eyelid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Indians, like the vivisectors of today, enjoyed the sensation of inflicting exquisite torture upon the helpless. This enabled them to do as they pleased with the bodies of their suffering victims, without the necessity of so much as tying their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Claude Bernard, a famous vivisector, describes curare as follows: “In this motionless body, behind that glazed eye, and with all the appearance of death, sensitiveness and intelligence persist in their entirety. The corpse before us hears and distinguishes all that is done around it. It suffers when pinched or irritated: in a word, it still has consciousness and volition, but it has lost the instruments which serve to manifest them.” '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. George W. Crile, another famous vivisector, noted for his tortures of 148 dogs, confirms this in an article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font5"> (July 13, 1912) in which he says, “Curare completely paralyzes the muscular system; it leaves the mind perfectly clear and the sense of pain normally keen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Vivisection Investigation League, which brings these facts to our attention, says: “Short of the cornea reflex (accompanying death) the creature cannot by the slightest reflex betray the state of his sensitivity. As a result, the presumptive evidence is that the curarized animal on the torture board of the laboratory is in the same plight as the man in the hands of his Indian enemies—in the hands of tormentors who do not greatly care about alleviation of pain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From a lengthy article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The American Journal of Physiology,</span><span class="font5"> February, 1923, covering vivisection experiments at the Western Reserve University, in which curare was used, and used repeatedly on both dogs and cats, the League summarizes the supposed objective as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a very long report—embodying some twenty variations upon a main theme—which theme is this: if you bind over the carotid artery of a dog or cat the device known as the plethysmograph, which will trace upon a revolving drum of carbon paper a line representing the rise and fall of blood pressure, how will those tracings vary if you cut into the animal’s right thigh, and exposing his sciatic nerve, you clamp electrodes against that nerve, while from his left leg —the one attached to the plethysmograph—you take out the nerve altogether ? In giving him electric shock on the raw nerve on one leg, you vary his blood pressure, due to the unspeakable agony, how much will that pressure vary if—(a) you give drugs or adrenalin solutions injected into the jugular vein, (b) how much will it vary if you administer curare with or without anesthetics or morphia, (e) also how do such records differ as between animals that have and those that have not been operated for cutting out the adrenal glands or for tying off the ducts to those glands ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The League invites thinking persons to imagine themselves rendered helpless while electric shocks are administered to their sciatic nerves. It cites these experiments as “perfectly valueless to physicians and surgeons engaged in alleviating human suffering” and worth minute consideration only as studies in thorough-going and deliberate torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same literature proves that some vivisectors put dogs through as many as three sets of tortures before permitting them to expire. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of Experimental Medicine,</span><span class="font5"> January, 1924, describes some of these experiments. We commend them to lovers of the eternal tor-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">turc theory. They might get an idea. It might help the sale of masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Material was obtained from the obstructed intestine of fourteen dogs, ” By elaborate methods this “material” was prepared and injected intravenously into the second scries of dogs. “Death was preceded by retching, vomiting, wide respiratory excursions of the abdominal type, bloody diarrhea, and tenesmus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some of the experiments portions of the dog’s anatomy were subjected to very hot water and the experimenters calmly remarked that “vomiting occurred, and one case in which boiling water was used resulted in unconsciousness. It is evident that the higher temperature caused pain”. Great discovery this! Mighty brilliant and valuable!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In its issue of February, 1924, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The American Journal of Physiology</span><span class="font5"> gives at length the revolting details of how the sex glands of sheep were pushed or transplanted into incisions made in the abdominal cavity and the animal was then allowed to linger on in suffering for seventy-six days, without a particle of evidence to show that these sufferings had any bearing on the good of anybody or anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems to us not unlikely that the refinement in cruelty now being studied will be made use of in Armageddon; and as Robespierre himself finally went to the guillotine, who can say but that some of these ■who have been so callous to the sufferings of others may eventually get a taste of their own medicine. For their sake let us hope that this may not be true. But Infinite Justice may exact such a price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cork and Its Uses</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">P</span><span class="font5">ORTUGAL produces 100,000 tons of cork a year; Spain, 80,000 tons; Algeria, 40,000 tons; France and Morocco, each 10,000 tons; with Italy and Tunisia each producing a smaller quantity. The cork oak grows to a great age and is cropped once in each ten years. The best quality is stripped when the tree is forty years old. Strippings from the larger branches afford a better grade of cork than does the trunk of the tree, which often grows to a diameter of four feet. The strippings may be as much as two and one-half inches in thickness, and on a large tree may amount to five hundred pounds. The higher the altitude at which the tree is grown, the slower the growth and the greater the density of the bark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the bark has been stripped it is first dried and is then boiled, so that its natural curvature can be removed. The outside woody surface is then scraped off and the various</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">qualities are carefully sorted into twenty-five grades, and after pressing and baling are ready for shipment to the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No part of the cork is wasted, since even cork flour is utilized. Much goes to the making of bottle stoppers, but the crown stopper, a fluted metal cap lined with a cork disk, is coming more and more into vogue, and a good grade of waste or composition cork serves the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For its heat-retarding properties cork is useful in cold storage plants, refrigerator cars, and dwellings, and as a pipe covering. Great quantities of it, compressed, baked, and cut into squares or other shapes, are used as tile floors in high-class buildings. Much of it is worked up in the manufacture of linoleum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cork is used for life-preservers, insoles, penholders, fishing-rods, instruments, and a great number of minor and varied uses too numerous to mention. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Beginning of God’s Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">M</span><span class="font5">ORE than any other one subject the Bible emphasizes God’s purpose to establish a righteous government which shall bring blessings to all the peoples of earth. The Scriptures disclose that God’s enemy Satan has been operating the governments of this world for many centuries. It follows, then, that Satan’s government must end and be ousted if righteousness is to have full sway in the earth. The time must come, when Satan’s government is still in operation, that God’s government through Christ must begin and that God through Christ will destroy Satan’s government, that righteousness may proceed unhindered. This morning consideration is given to the time of the beginning of God’s government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah fixed the “times of the Gentiles” and thereby indicated the time of the end of Satan’s rule. For many centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler of the world; not by right, but by permission or sufferance of Jehovah. It follows that when God’s time arrived to set His Anointed One upon His throne such time would mark the end of Satan’s rule by permission. Knowing that the Devil is the opponent of God, which is indicated by his name Satan, it is certain that Satan would not abdicate willingly but would be ousted by the Lord. Of course Jehovah could oust Satan and destroy all of his power instantly, but that does not seem to be God’s way of doing His work. The facts show that while the ouster proceedings are in progress God is doing some special work with His anointed and gives notice to the nations of the earth concerning His purposes. With Jehovah everything proceeds orderly and in order. It will be found from the evidence that the ouster proceedings against Satan began in 1914 and that the work is still progressing. That work must progress until God’s government of righteousness for man is fully and completely established in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Period of the Gentiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All peoples or nations aside from Jews are designated in the Scriptures as Gentiles or heathen. The reason for this is that the Jews, or Israelites, were God’s people and over them He was the Ruler. When God permitted the Gentiles to overthrow Zedekiah, Israel’s last king, there the Gentiles or non-Jews began universal reign, and from that time the Gentile times began to count. The date of the overthrow of Zedekiah is positively fixed by the Scriptures and also by profane history as 606 B.C. It was in that year that Satan became the god of the entire world, that is to say, the invisible ruler over all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It follows then that the end of the Gentile times would also mark the beginning of the time when Satan would no longer be permitted to rule without interference. It becomes important to fix definitely by competent proof the period of the Gentiles, which Jesus called “the times of the Gentiles”. (Luke 21: 24) There are two lines of direct evidence corroborative of each other, and there is one line of circumstantial evidence which also corroborates the direct evidence, as to “the times of the Gentiles”. All three show that “the times of the Gentiles”, or period of the Gentiles, ended with 1914 A.D. That date therefore fixes the time of the end of Satan’s rule, and from that time forward interference with his rule is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One line of this testimony relates to the punishment of Israel, which began 606 B.C. and must continue for a period of “seven times”. Repeatedly the Israelites broke God’s covenant with them and were punished therefor. (Judg. 3:14; 4: 2, 3; 10: 7, 8; 13:1) Jehovah warned the Israelites that if they persisted in breaking their covenant He would punish them “seven times more”, or seven times additional to what He had already punished them. “And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. But if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.”—Lev. 26:17,18, 31,33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through His prophet Ezekiel God also recounted the many experiences of Israel and His determination to punish Israel for her disobedience. (Ezek. 20:1-39) God’s final decree against Israel was stated through His prophet in these words: “Therefore thus saith the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins ‘do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: aud it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.”—Ezek. 21: 24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zedekiah was then the king of Israel. Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began his reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jeru-salem. (2 Chron. 36: 9-11) “And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.” (Jer. 39:2, 6, 7) Zedekiah began his reign in the year 617 B.C., and eleven years thereafter, to wit, in the year 606 B. C., he was taken prisoner and carried away to Babylon and the nation of Israel fell. That was the exact time of the enforcement of God’s decree against Israel. That date, to wit, 606 B.C., fixes beyond doubt the beginning of the universal Gentile rule which is called the Gentile times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A “time”, as used in the Scriptures, has reference to a year, whether it be used literally or symbolically. A symbolic “time” is reckoned according to the lunar year of 360 days. Therefore a symbolic year or time would mean a period of 360 literal years. (Ezek. 4:6) “Seven times,” as used in the Scriptures, would therefore, if literal, mean seven literal years; and, if symbolic, would be seven times 360 years, or a total of 2,520 literal years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures show clearly that the “'seven times” of punishment upon Israel must be considered as symrbolic and not literal. Israel had previously suffered punishment for a longer period than seven literal years. (Judg. 3: 8,14) The Jews were actually in Babylon seventy years; and after they returned from Babylon they continued to suffer punishment at the hands of other nations and peoples. It must be concluded that the period of time referred to is symbolic time. That period of punishment which began 606 B.C. and continued seven symbolic times, or 2,520 years, would end in 1914 A.D. The physical facts show that the beginning of the World War in 1914 greatly enthused the Jews to get back into their own land, and by the time the war had ended the leading nations of the earth had agreed that the Jews should have their homeland. Their punishment had ended.—Isa. 40:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another line of direct testimony relates to the experiences of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon Who was the first emperor of the World power Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar had a dream, and God’s prophet Daniel gave the interpretation of that dream. (Dan. 4:1-28) The fact that the inspired prophet of God gave the interpretation, and that the record thereof is so carefully made in God’s Word, shows that it was the purpose of God to record it for the benefit of those true Christians Who would be on the earth at “the time of the end” and who would then have the privilege of understanding the meaning thereof; and that such understanding would be for the encouragement and comfort of Christians.—Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In giving the interpretation, the Prophet Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar: “They<sup>7</sup> shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall Avet thee with the deAv of heaven, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">seven times</span><span class="font5"> shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to AvhomsoeA<sup>7</sup>er he will.”—Dan. 4: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan. was the god or invisible ruler of all the world, and Nebuchadnezzar was the first emperor of that world power. God caused Daniel to refer then to all the World powers, to wit, Babylon and those that folloAved after, under the symbol of “wild beasts”. (Dan. 7:17) The governments symbolized by “wild beasts” were to continue Avithout interruption until the corning of God’s Anointed One.—Dan. 7:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That which the Prophet Daniel foretold in the interpretation of the dream was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar: “All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.” He was driven into the field and lived like a beast for seven years. Those seven years of time were symbolic of the entire period of time that Satan’s world powers should continue without interruption. The experiences of Nebuchadnezzar symbolically represented that nations of the earth, under their invisible ruler Satan, would be beastly until the time when the people would recognize the government of the Most High. This is indicated by the words of the prophet: “And seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.” Otherwise stated, the vision or dream was this: “The Gentile dominion shall be beastly and it shall be under the supervision of Satan for a period of seven times and until the time of the beginning of the kingdom of the Most High.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gentile times, as above stated, began with Nebuchadnezzar, in the year 606 B.C. “Seven times,” or 2,520 literal years, would cause the Gentile times to end in the year 1914 A.D. That would mark, then, the time when He whose right it is should take the power granted to Him as the great executive officer of the Most High and when He would begin to exercise His power and authority for the overthrow of Satan’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two lines of testimony that agree as to the length of the Gentile times. “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.” (Dent. 19:15) Jehovah thus stated the manner of the proof of any important matter. In addition to the direct testimony God further provides circumstantial evidence, which evidence is stronger, if possible, than the direct testimony above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Beginning of Sorrows</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When prophecy is written or uttered, seldom if ever is the time of the fulfilment of that prophecy definitely stated or indicated. “Prophecy” means the foretelling of what will come to pass at.some future time. There is a 'way to determine definitely when that prophecy is fulfilled, and God has provided that way. If events come to pass or facts are made knowm which fit exactly the terms of the prophecy, then we may know that the time that these events come to pass is the time for the fulfilment of that prophecy. These events thus coming to pass, and fitting the terms of the prophecy, are called the physical facts. Any one who reads prophecy, and then observes the physical facts which fit exactly with that which is prophesied, may properly interpret the prophecy as being fulfilled at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a great prophecy spoken by Jesus only a few days before His crucifixion. That prophecy must have a fulfilment at some future time. Now the physical facts that have come to pass, and which exactly fit the terms of the prophecy, show that the prophecy spoken by Him has been fulfilled. Any one reading that prophecy, and then knowing the physical facts and applying the same to the prophecy, can see the fulfilment of that prophecy. It will be found that the fulfilment of the prophecy spoken by the Lord Jesus exactly corroborates the two lines of testimony above given concerning the Gentile times, and shows that His prophecy began to have its fulfilment in 1914. It also marks 1914 as the date when ‘he whose right it is’ to reign should take His power and authority and begin His reign and begin His operations to oust Satan from the rule over the world. The beginning of that time is designated by the Lord Jesus as “the beginning of sorrows” upon the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the prophets had foretold the fact of the establishment of God's kingdom of righteousness. The disciples of Jesus were familiar with those prophecies. In addition thereto Jesus had taught them of the coming government or kingdom of righteousness. He had told them that it would not come until the end of the world over which Satan reigned as prince. He had told them that He would come again and receive them unto Himself and that they should share with Him His kingdom or government of righteousness. It is easily to be seen why, with these things in the minds of His disciples, they were keenly interested concerning His coming and the end of the world. They came to Jesus privately and propounded to Him this question: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?”—Matt. 24:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer of Jesus indicated that there would be a long period of time that would elapse before that day of His coming and the end of the world. Necessarily the end of the world would mark the time when He would take His ' power and begin His reign. Then He told His disciples what should be observed by His fol-low’ers on earth at the beginning of that period of time. He did not tell them to look into the skies for some manifestation of visible power. He told them the events that would be coming to pass upon the earth that could be readily seen by all persons. He said: “Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.”—Matt. 24: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The year 1914 saw the opening or beginning of the very events Jesus mentioned. Many wars had come and gone before that time; but with the war of 1914 nation rose against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, the like of which had never before come to pass. It is important also to notice that the principal ones involved in that war were those nations which claimed to be “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”. The nations that had established a religion, and given it the misnomer “Christian religion”, in 1914 became involved in the most deadly conflict of time. What did it mean </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It marked the end of the time when Satan would be permitted to rule the nations of the earth without interference. Of course Jesus knew that the beginning of that time would be marked by a war, because Satan would then become angry and would cause the nations over which he ruled to become angry. Subsequently Christ Jesus gave to one of His disciples, John, a revelation of what should come to pass at that time. He said: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.”—Rev. 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True to the prophecy of Jesus, 1914 did mark “the beginning of sorrows”. It was the beginning of a sorrowful time for Satan and his rule and the beginning of great sorrows upon the peoples over which he had long been the invisible ruler. The World War brought the greatest sorrow that has ever befallen the nations of earth. It was accompanied, as Jesus foretold, with a great pestilence that really took away in death more people than were killed in the war. Shortly thereafter in the wake of the war came a devastating famine during which millions of people died of starvation. There have been more earthquakes experienced since 1914 than ever before in the history of man. In the Scriptures “earthquake” is used as a symbol of revolution. Not only have there been literal earthquakes, but there have been symbolic earthquakes or revolutions which have shaken many of the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that Jesus declared that the things above mentioned would constitute “the beginning of sorrows” shows that other sorrows would follow. It has been even so. The advocates of the World War insisted that the war would so clear the governmental atmosphere that everlasting peace and quiet would follow amongst the people and that contentment and prosperity would be their lot. That which has actually come to pass has been exactly contrary to those predictions. Jesus said it would be as it is. Instead of the World War’s bringing prosperity and being followed by desirable conditions, Jesus said that then there would be “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity ; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth”.—Luke 21:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some time after the World War the president of the United States, discussing conditions of distress in the world, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are days of great perplexity, when a great cloud hangs over the world. It seems as if great blind material forces had been released which had for long been held in leash and restraint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other men of note expressed similar views:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before the war people often supposed that ours was a Christian culture. The war has revealed us to ourselves. Civilization is pagan.—Dr. Bernard I. Bell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have come to the crossroads and no one knows the way out.—H. G. Wells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The future is very dark. We have reached the twilight of civilization.—Dr. H. L. Brailsford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the war ended distress continues; and now a decade after the war every nation of earth is in perplexity, and the people in distress, and fear has taken hold upon them all. They are in trepidation as to what the future holds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In further fulfilment of the prophecy stated by Jesus concerning the end of the world, during the World War true Christians were persecuted because they would not violate their conscience and God’s command by engaging in the killing of their fellow man. The hatred of all nations involved in the war was directed against such.—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many who have claimed to be Christians manifested, and continue to manifest, hatred toward each other and to betray their brethren, as the Lord foretold. (Matt. 24:10) These are additional sorrows. Many false prophets have arisen to deceive the people; and particularly amongst these are the clergy, who since 1914 have openly denied God and denied that He would ever establish a righteous government on the earth. (Matt. 24:11) Another part of that prophecy rvas: “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” (Matt. 24:12) Iniquity means lawlessness. There never has been a time of such lawlessness against God and His righteousness as now, and that in countries claiming to be Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore the Jews are gathering into their homeland and rebuilding it, even as Jesus foretold they would at the end of the world.—-Luke 21:24?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there were no other evidence available save that given by the great prophecy of Jesus above quoted, the physical facts coming to pass since 1914 would prove beyond a doubt that that year marked the great turning point in the affairs of men. The indisputable testimony establishes beyond a doubt that 1914 marks the beginning of the time mentioned by God's prophet when He would give the rulership to Him “whose right it is”. There is no other explanation to the conditions now existing on earth. God intends for the people who seek for the truth to learn from these events that the day of their deliverance is at hand and that soon His righteous government shall be available for their benefit and blessings—Luke 21: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">War in Heaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures make it clear that Satan, although the enemy of God, was permitted to continue in heaven until God’s due time to oust him. It is written: “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also.” (Job 1:6) That was written after the flood, and the circumstances seem to indicate beyond doubt that Satan had access to heaven at that time. Associated with Satan in his wicked rule in heaven there has been a host of evil spirits or angels. (Eph. 6:12) Those evil ones together with the Devil have constituted the invisible part of the world exercising power and influence over men and 'which in His due time God, through Christ, will destroy.—2 Pet. 3:7-13; 1 John 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long ago God fixed the time at which He would oust Satan from heaven. He knew just when that time would be, and whether He disclosed it to any one or not is not revealed. The indications from the Scriptures are that He told not even the Lord Jesus, but God Himself knew all about it, of course. “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning.”—Acts 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After His resurrection and appearance in heaven Jesus presented Himself to Jehovah and God said to Him: “Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1) This proves conclusively that God had then determined to throw Satan out of heaven and that Satan for some time thereafter would be at the earth. The earth is God’s footstool (Isa. 66:1), and the making of Satan the footstool of Jesus meant that God would put him under His feet. Gntil that time should arrive Jesus must wait. Christ Jesus was at that time clothed with authority and power, and this is indicated by the fact that God said to Him: 'Sit down upon my throne, and at my right hand,’ which meant the position of favor. Jesus Himself said that He sat down with His Father on the throne when He ascended on high. Whatever else Christ Jesus did from that t</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font5">e forward, He did nothing toward ousting Satan the enemy from heaven until God’s due time .arrived. Then we should expect Him to act exactly in harmony with Jehovah’s will. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan the enemy was permitted to continue in his nefarious work, and that without let or hindrance, God well knowing that in His own due time He would cause even the wicked works of Satan to praise Him. For centuries Jesus Christ beheld the arrogance of Satan and his defiant wickedness against God. He saw him exercising his evil influence over the governments, nations and peoples of the earth, and turning them away from God. He must have taken note that Satan slandered and misrepresented Jehovah and persecuted Christians on earth who were faithfully obeying Jehovah’s command; yet amidst all this He must wait. God had a well-defined purpose in having Jesus wait until His own due time before taking ac-. tion. Paul corroborated the statement of the waiting of Jesus Avhen He said: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; . . . till his enemies be made his footstool.”—Heb. 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manifestly God would in due time call upon His beloved Son to act, and the time of beginning of action would be at the end of the world and at the time when ‘he whose right it is’ should come, as God had foretold by His prophet. The proof above submitted shows conclusively that that due time was in 1914. The Scriptures show that when the due time did arrive Jehovah gave command to His beloved Son as Prince and Priest to begin action against Satan, and that marked the “beginning of sorrows”. It is written: “The Lord [Jehovah] shall send the rod [scepter of authority and rightful power reposed in His Son] of thy strength out of Zion [God’s organization; saying]: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.”—Ps. 110: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At that time Christ Jesus stood up, that is to say, He assumed His power and authority and began action against the enemy, and the action still continues against the enemy, although Satan’s right to exercise power has expired. That time marked the beginning of the battle in heaven by the King of glory, the Son of Jehovah, and His angels on one side, and Satan, otherwise called the “old dragon”, God’s disloyal son, and his angels on the other side. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God would have it understood that it is His fight and that Christ Jesus is leading the fight against the enemy and therefore in due time Jehovah says: ‘This is my fight, I will accomplish this work through my beloved Son.’ Of course the arrogant Satan would not abdicate in heaven; therefore the fight followed. This is corroborated by the prophecy of Daniel, wherein it is stated that Michael began His activities against Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Michael” means the Anointed One of God, which is Christ Jesus. The prophet said: “And at that time [to wit, at the end of the world, in 1914, or the ‘beginning of sorrows’] shall Michael stand up, the great prince which stand-eth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time.” (Dan. 12:1) There the time of trouble began in heaven; and at the same time the trouble broke out in the earth. In the heavenly trouble Satan was completely ousted, and the trouble in earth will continue until it culminates in the greatest tribulation ever known, resulting in the complete destruction of Satan’s governments invisible as well as visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Corroborative proof is found in chapter twelve of Revelation. That book is written in symbolic phrase. There the word “woman” is used to symbolize Zion, which is God’s organization, and which gives birth to the righteous government, which government is pictured under the symbol “man child”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the prophecy it is written: “Before she travailed, she brought forth ... a man child.” (Isa. 66:7) This being properly interpreted means that the government was born before the fight began. Necessarily that must be, because the new government must come into existence before it could fight against Satan’s government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Revelation picture there appeared unto the true and faithful followers of Christ “a great wonder in heaven”. That does not mean that the Christians saw with their natural eyes, but the faithful students of divine prophecy discerned the great wonder represented by the “woman”, to wit, God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “woman” represents Zion and is “clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars”. This symbolic language means that Zion has the sunlight of God’s Word and truth, and walks according to His law, which is symbolized by “the moon”; and “a crown upon her head” symbolizes that God has reposed complete authority in the Head of Zion, His beloved Son; whereas the “twelve stars” particularly represent the twelve spiritual tribes of Israel representing the church of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- At the same time “another wonder” appeared in heaven, “a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads”. (Rev. 12: 3) The “great red dragon” is the Devil’s organization. (Rev. 20:1-3) The “seven heads” represent that the evil one has exercised complete invisible power over the nations of earth; while the “ten horns” symbolically represent that he controls all the governments and nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Seven” is a symbol of things complete, of things that are invisible, while “ten” is a symbol of the completeness of things visible. Therefore the two together show that before the beginning of the fight, and at the birth of The Government, the Devil exercised complete power in heaven (invisible) and earth over the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The birth of the “man child” symbolically represents The Government and marks the time when Christ’s government began its activity against Satan. The first act of that new government is to oust Satan from heaven. The war in heaven began, and Satan was thrown out into the earth. “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceive the whole world,: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is' cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”—Rev. 12: 7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are enabled to interpret this prophecy as to time, because of what happened in the earth; and that being “the beginning of sorrows”, marked by the beginning of the World War in 1914, fixes the time; and those sorrows must continue until the great battle of God Almighty against the Devil, which will result in the destruction of all his earthly power. (Rev. 16: 13-16) The battle in heaven ended, the operations were transferred to the earth. “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.”—Rev. 12:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan at that time and since, seeing that his time is short for the preparation for the great battle of Armageddon, continues to influence the nations of the world to prepare for another great war while he, through the clergy, launches a -wicked persecution against those who faithfully represent God on earth. This terrible persecution continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This explains why the clergy and their organized system of religion throughout the earth today is opposed to the proclamation of the truth concerning God’s righteous government being established on earth. Jesus not only stated that the World War (1914) would be the beginning of sorrows, but further stated that the final end would be marked by the greatest tribulation ever known in the earth and that that would be the last. “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.”—-Matt. 24:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These words of the Master explain the feverish and desperate effort being put. forth by the rulers of the various governments of earth to prepare for trouble. Undoubtedly the rulers of these governments do not know that Satan is really instigating the preparation. The purpose of calling attention to it here is not to hold up the rulers to shame and disgrace but to point out the facts that the rulers, as well as the. people, may know that Satan is the great enemy of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that great battle in heaven the fight was led by Jesus, and He was successful. The prophet shows that Jehovah, addressing His beloved Son at that time, said: “The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” (Ps. 110:4) This proves that Christ Jesus is the antitype of Melchizedek and leads the fight against Satan the enemy as the great Field -Marshal of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then the prophet represents Jehovah God on the right hand of His beloved Son, which means that Jehovah is His chief support: “My Lord on thy right hand, hath shattered in the day of his anger kings; he will judge among the nations, full of dead bodies. He hath shattered the head over a land far extended.”—■ Ps. 110: 5, 6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In further corroboration upon this point God’s prophet speaks of Christ Jesus taking His authority to lead the forces, of righteousness against the evil one and to victory: “Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, 0 most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. And in thy majesty ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things,'’ —Ps. 45:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God, through His prophet Daniel, gave an outline of the world powers, to wit, Babylon, when it became a world pow’er, and those that followed, including the British Empire and the League of Nations. The League is a combination of more than fifty nations and is an organization of what is called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity”. The real author of the League of Nations is Satan the Devil. He is the master mind that brought about this “confederacy” of nations for the purpose of ruling the world.. But that confederacy God declares shall completely fail and shall be broken to pieces. (Isa. 8:9-12) It is approximately at that time that the prophecy written by Daniel begins its fulfilment. It is written: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” —Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, mark that it was in 1914 that the nations of earth began to assemble in war or tumult and the people began to imagine a foolish thing, to wit, that the World War would make the nations of earth safe for democracy; and further, that this could be brought about by a confederacy of nations. It was at that time that the prophecy was fulfilled by Jehovah’s placing upon the throne His beloved Son. Then the earthly rulers met together by appointment and the statesmen, financiers, and the clergy of the world agreed that they would not heed the fulfilment of prophecy, as set forth in God’s Word, but would themselves set up a rule on earth and call it ‘the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth’. This they did, calling it the League of Nations. They took counsel together against God and against His anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord holds them in derision and will exercise His power against them in due time. Mark how Jehovah through His prophet, foretold exactly what has been transpiring in this regard beginning in 1914: “Wherefore have nations assembled in tumult? Or should peoples mutter an empty thing? The kings of earth take their station. And grave men have met by appointment together, against Yahweh and against his Anointed One (saying): Let us break asunder their bonds, and cast from us their cords I He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh, My Lord will mock at them: then will he speak unto them in his anger, and in his wrath confound them: yet I have installed my king, on Zion my holy mountain.”—Ps. 2:1-6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These scriptures establish beyond a doubt the fact that God is proceeding to set up a government of righteousness and that in setting it up no ambitious politician, conscienceless profiteer or clergyman will have anything to do with it. Christ is the invisible ruler of the government of righteousness and He will have His representatives on earth in God’s due time to conduct earth’s affairs aright. The setting up of His kingdom, which began in 1914, now progresses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">QUESTION:</span><span class="font5"> Please give me an explanation 'Qp of James 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> In our judgment the so-called healings of the sick by mental suggestions are not actual healings at all, but are hallucinations brought about by the power of demons. James 5:14-16 refers to a healing of spiritual sickness. It does not refer to physical healing at all. Notice how it reads: “The prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up [restore him to his favor]; and if [though] he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. [Therefore] confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font5"> Is there anything in the Bible that reveals the origin of the Negro?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font5"> It is generally believed that the curse which Noah pronounced upon Canaan was the origin of the Black race. Certain it is that when Noah said, “Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren,” he pictured the future of the Colored race. They have been and are a race of servants, but now in the dawn of the twentieth century, we are all coming to see this matter of service in its true light and to find that the only real joy in life is in serving others; not bossing them. There is no servant in the world as good as a good Colored servant, and the joy that he gets from rendering faithful service is one of the purest joys there is in the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That Jesus expected such would be the case when He came again into the land of His birth, is shown by a statement He made on this occasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And Jesus stayed not long in Nazareth, nor did many mighty works there, because of the unbelief of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Jesus called together His twelve chosen disciples, or apostles, as we call the twelve chosen, for the word “apostle” signifies ambassador or representative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He gave them His blessing, and instructed them to go forth into all the land and tell the truth to the people. He gave them power over the evil spirits, and power to work miracles, in order that they might show the people that He came from God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After instructing His twelve chosen disciples, or apostles, Jesus departed into the land of Galilee, to preach and to teach in the cities there. Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard of the fame of Jesus, and said to his officers, “'This is John the Baptist: he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.”&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We remember the sad death of John, the forerunner of Jesus, who was beheaded by Herod because Herod was displeased when John told him it was illegal to steal his brother’s wife. But we know that Jesus was not John the Baptist risen from the dead: He was and is the Son of God, who before His coming to earth was seated at the right hand of our heavenly Father, and who made all things under the Father’s direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this time Jesus performed one of His most wonderful miracles. We can not do better than take the whole story of this event from the Bible just as it was written in the book of Mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And Jesus,- when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd; and he began .to teach them many things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed: Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. Then they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat ? He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass. And they sat down in ranks by hundreds, and by fifties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And they did all eat, and were filled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes. And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men. And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sea of Galilee was, as we learned from a previous story, a shallow body of water very subject to sudden storms. The little boats called “'ships” in those days ’were probably no larger than a fishing dory or catboat that our New-England fishermen use for running up and down the coast. They w-ere sailing vessels, of course, but were not of very strong construction; nor were the sailors of those times very skilled in nautical science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So w<sup>T</sup>hcn the apostles sailed away to Bethsaida across the sea of Galilee, leaving Jesus behind, they were on the eve of another adventure fully as wonderful as that they had just •witnessed with the loaves and fishes. What this was will be told in our next story.</span></p>
