<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Oxman’s Letters to Rigall</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">OULD you think it possible that they could continue to keep Mooney in prison in California when it is known that Frank C. Oxman, star witness for the prosecution, urged Bigall to take a free trip to California at the state’s expense and furnish framed testimony at the Mooney trial? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Definition of a Pacifist</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">fTTHE &quot;Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font7"> on its editorial page, -*• says, “The true pacifist is a just and honorable man who abominates war because it is cruel, unfair, and hideous: because it is organized murder and crime, unwillingly done by men who had no share in causing it.” The same article also said, “War will continue while angry men can find suckers to do their fighting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Increase of Millionaires</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N THE year 1914 there were seven thousand millionaires in the United States. Now there are more than four times as many. That is the way the interest system works; but all are wondering what will happen when it gets to the place where the common people, who have no interest incomes, get to the place where they can no longer carry the load. It can be proven mathematically that the interest scheme will destroy any civilization built upon it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">English-speaking Weisbaden</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">S A result of the ten years’ occupancy of Weisbaden by British troops there have been about nine hundred marriages of British soldiers to German girls, and Weisbaden is today one of the principal English-speaking communities in Germany. The French army, in the adjacent city of Mainz, does not fraternize with the German populace. The French army, as an army, is always conspicuously in sight, and the British army, as an army, is not to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jewish General Hospital in Jerusalem</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HO HE Jewish General Hospital in Jerusalem -T would be a credit to any city. The building is wide and deep, two stories in height. It is of pleasing appearance, is surrounded with shrubbery reaching to the second-story windows, and is large enough to occupy an entire city block. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Development of Fruit of the Date Palm</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HP HE United States Department of Agriculture has discovered that pollen from certain male trees causes the production of small seeds and small fruits that ripen early, while pollen from other trees causes the production of large seeds and large fruits that ripen late. It is believed that the scientific importance of this discovery will be very great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Communist Exhaustion in Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE claim is made that the high pace at which the People’s Commissars work at Moscow, and the strain of their work, brings on a nervous disorder that is carrying many of these men into an early grave. Nearly all active workers of the central party are said to be suffering similarly. Symptoms are nervousness, insomnia, progressive general debility, hardening of the arteries, and finally death from bodily exhaustion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">One Cure per Thousand at Lourdes</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ESPITE the fact that the official figures for 1924 showed that only one pilgrim to the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes was healed out of every' one thousand who visited the shrine, business is as brisk as ever during the usual tourist season. The climate of southeastern France, the air and the water, are all so good that it is impossible for many persons to visit the neighborhood without receiving some benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deaths of Women Miners in India</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N THE mines of Bihar and Orissa, British</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">India, the underground workers include 32,000 women, of whom thirty were killed in mining accidents last year. The average daily wages of these poor women is seven annas, or about seventeen cents. They are begging not to be excluded from the mines, as their earnings are needed to help out the family income. --</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Public Utility Dividends</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HAT the public utility crowd is absolutely the biggest hold-up crowd in the United States is proven by the fact that the cash dividends paid to these people at the end of 1928 were $162,292,725 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font7"> than the sum total of dividends paid to all the railroads in the country. Does this show why the Power Trust could afford to spend millions to debauch the college professors and the newspapers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Baumes Law Falling into Disfavor</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE Baumes law, under which fourth offenders are automatically given life sentences, has received a severe blow in Michigan, where the mother of ten children was given a lifesentence for selling liquor. New York State is now making a careful study of criminals, with the view of trying to find some better way to handle the distressing problem of the habitual criminal. It is found that 65.5 percent of the offenders come from, broken homes and hence know little or nothing of the joys of a happy home circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Disposition of the Royalty</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN Europe suddenly went republican, coincident with the World War, the former emperor of Germany became a burgher in Holland; Empress Zita of Austria-Hungary lives in a small village in Spain; King George of Greece lives in Rumania; Queen Amelia of Portugal lives in France, and the former shah of Persia lives in Paris. The pretenders to the thrones of Turkey, Russia and Montenegro are all living in exile, not daring to return to their homelands. When Kaiser Wilhelm went down he dragged down 300 royal and titled persons from all over Europe. His own children live in Germany, enjoying their property. Most of the Hapsburgs are still in Austria, without property and without titles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Expense of Food Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THE Bureau of Research of Harvard University, after a careful study of the problem, has reached the conclusion that nearly half of the cost of food to the consumer is the expense of getting the food into his hands. Advertising, warehousing, sales and marketing take nearly fifty percent out of every dollar the purchaser pays for his food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kind-hearted Woman. Sheriff</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TN KANSAS a kind-hearted woman sheriff " allowed all the prisoners to go home and be with their families over the holidays. All of them returned to jail to finish their sentences. Why not turn out all the men sheriffs and put in women all over the country? It might help a lot. That Kansas woman lias made the law honored, respected and loved in her home county and has set a good example for the whole country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Children Teaching Their Parents</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font7">EW YORK now has fifty boy teachers thirteen years of age whose duty it is to teach their parents the English language and bring their work to school for examination. The boys complain that their parents are so interested, and take so much of their time with the studies, that they now get no chance to play. It is believed that this method can be used to turn New York from a polyglot city into a strictly American one where English will be universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Advancements in Astronomy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">ITH the aid of a large telescope it is now possible to detect the heat from a candleflame at a distance of 100 miles. Changes of temperature of a millionth of a degree can be easily recorded and accurately measured. It is found that the temperatures on the moon daily range from 265 degrees Fahrenheit, which is far above the boiling-point, to 196 degrees below zero, which is cold enough to freeze alcohol. With the new 200-inch telescope it would be possible to see the light of a candle 41,000 miles away. Astronomers are said to be now convinced that the universe is a closed one, there being an actual limit to the area which has been opened up by creation. It is definitely known that the thirty billion stars thin out rapidly with increasing distance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Measuring Moisture in Lumber</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">NEW device for measuring the moisture content of lumber works as readily as an apparatus for testing the strength of batteries or electric light bulbs. It is based on the fact that water-soaked wood is a better conductor of electricity than dry wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparations for Defense</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N A speech delivered at Manchester, England, Lloyd George said to his audience: “Gigantic preparations for defense that were made before 1914 made war, and they will make it again. We must reestablish terms of good will with the United States. Without that disarmament is impossible; with it disarmament would be irresistible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vast Plains Between Brazil and Guiana</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HUIE world is yet so new that Brazil, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Guiana are only now exploring their boundaries. The discovery has been made that the plateau between the two countries, hitherto unknown, contains not less than fifteen thousand square miles of plains with rich pasturage for cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Two Percent Have the Incomes</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN you read the glittering statistics about Uncle Sam’s wealth per capita, please remember that there are only 2,470,000 who pay income taxes and that the remaining 98 percent, or about 116,000,000, have incomes too small to figure in the returns. On the basis of five persons to the family, these figures show that only 10 percent of the families of the country have comfortable incomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">College Graduates Feel the Pinch</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Index,</span><span class="font7"> published by The New York Trust</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Company, makes the observation that “The problem of what is to be done with the growing number of college graduates represents a particular aspect of the general employment question, for which no solution has been offered. It has been pointed out, however, that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the educated proletariat to find occupation suited to their training”. This means that jobs are scarce for the sons of poor men, even though these men are fully qualified to fill them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wet Towel over the Microphone</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TT IS claimed that a wet towel placed over the microphone has the effect of emphasizing a singer’s voice and at the same time of subduing the sound of the accompanying orchestra. It is said to be the discovery of Harry Lauder and to give excellent results in the broadcasting of vocal music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chain Stores Ruining Merchants</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TN THE year 1925 one-fourth of one percent of all the stores in America were making 45% of the total profits, and over 99 percent of the stores were making less money than two years previous. Two-fifths of the stores were being run at a loss, a picture of what the chain stores are doing to merchants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Substitute for a Parachute</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A GERMAN has invented a substitute for a parachute. When an airplane is in danger, the pilot or passenger presses a button and compressed air hurls him from the machine. Once clear, the air inflates a new type of flying suit which is filled with a non-explosive gas and in which the passenger floats quietly to terra firma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A Brave Mississippi Woman</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">fa</span><span class="font7"> BRAVE Mississippi woman went alone and unarmed to the cabin where she knew a negro criminal was sheltered. She arrested the man and endeavored to place him in the hands of the law. She would have done so but for the mob of two thousand men who, by superior force, tore the criminal from her possession and lynched him, thus shaming the state which she honored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Army Monoplane “Question Mark”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE army monoplane “Question Mark”, which remained aloft something over six days without coming down for fuel, seems to show the way by which long distance flights will be made. This plane, had it been flying in a straight line, would have gone very nearly half-way around the earth, before it descended. There is now talk of a non-stop flight around the world, with refueling as done for the “Question Maric”, and it is believed that this is entirely possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N THE two thousand islands of Melanesia more than forty languages are spoken; and it happens in some instances that natives on one side of an island have no communication whatever with natives on the other side. Infanticide is common and there are still hundreds of Melanesians who have an appetite for human flesh and know what it tastes like. These islands are under the joint control of France and Britain, with France rather edging Britain out,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What the Railroads Cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N AN investigation conducted a generation ago the late Thomas Fortune Ryan, one of the greatest railroad men of his day, made the statement on the witness stand that 95 percent of the stock of railroad corporations in America never cost a dollar. The roads were built with bonds, and besides, the Union Pacific received land grants worth $250,000,000 and the Atchison road the same. The same is substantially true of the St. Paul, Northwestern and Omaha roads. Ryan gave the facts to back up his statements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">U</span><span class="font7">NTIL recently most of us never heard of cacodyl isocyanide and plass, but the future of civilization may be in their hands. Cacodyl isocyanide is so poisonous that a whiff will kill a man outright, and so easy to make that thousands of tons could be made in a day, and at less cost than powder and cannon. Plass is the material from which the almost invisible airplane is made. A few plass airplanes loaded with cacodyl isocyanide would obliterate any army that could be gathered together.</span></p>

With the advent of the automobile the situation has been complicated somewhat and agitation is now rife that elephants must keep off the highways at night or else carry front and rear lights.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The New Milk Container</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THE new milk container, already in limited use in New York city, is made, sterilized, filled and sealed in a single operation. It is claimed that milk has kept sweet in these containers for as long as forty-seven days. The consumer cuts off the pinched top of the container with a pair of scissors, pours out what is needed and pinches the top back together. New York uses four million quarts of milk a day, fifty thousand of which are now served, in the new containers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">On the smnniit of the Cholula pyramid, which is only 177 feet from the ground, there was originally erected a temple covering one acre, of ground, consecrated to the worship of the god Quetzalcoatl,  (the god of the air/’ The prince of the power of the air.’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The traditions of the Aztecs were that the Cholula pyramid was built- by Quetzalcoatl himself; that he was the high priest of the temple and wore always a mitre waving with, plumes of fire; that he had palaces of gold and silver and precious stones; and that he had the most profound wisdom, which he displayed in the laws which he left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Quetzalcoatl is said to have finally sailed away to the East on a craft, of snakes and to have left word that some day bearded white men would come again from the East and enter the country and rule it.

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Excerpts from the Introduction of “Falsehood in War-Time”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Arthur Ponsonby, M. P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE object of this volume is not to cast fresh blame on authorities and individuals, nor is it to expose one nation more than another to accusations of deceit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Falsehood is a recognized and extremely useful weapon in warfare, and every country uses it quite deliberately to deceive its own people, to attract neutrals, and to mislead the enemy. The ignorant and innocent masses in each country are unaware at the time that they are being misled, and when it is all over only here and there are the falsehoods discovered and exposed. As it is all past history and the desired effect has been produced by the stories and statements, no one troubles to investigate the facts and establish the truth. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The use of the weapon of falsehood is more necessary in a country where military conscription is not the law of the land than in countries where the manhood of the nation is automatically drafted into the army, navy, or air service. The public can be worked up emotionally by sham ideals. A sort of collective hysteria spreads and rises until finally it gets the better of sober people and reputable newspapers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* * * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With a warning before them, the common people may be more on their guard when the war cloud next appears on the horizon and less disposed to accept as truth the rumours, explanations, and pronouncements issued for their consumption. They should realize that a government which has decided on embarking on the hazardous and terrible enterprise of war must at the outset present a one-sided case in justification of its action, and cannot afford to admit in any particular whatever the smallest degree of right or reason on the part of the people it has made up its mind to fight. Facts must be distorted, relevant circumstances concealed, and a picture presented which by its crude colouring will persuade the ignorant people that their government is blameless, their cause is righteous, and that the indisputable wickedness of the enemy has been proved beyond question. A moment’s reflection would tell any reasonable person that such obvious bias cannot possibly represent the truth. But the moment’s reflection is not allowed; lies are circulated with great rapidity. The unthinking mass accept them and by their excitement sway the rest. The amount of rubbish and humbug that pass under the name of patriotism in war-time in all countries is sufficient to make decent people blush when they are subsequently disillusioned. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In calm retrospect we can appreciate better the disastrous effect of the poison of falsehood, whether officially, semi-officially, or privately manufactured. It has been rightly said that the injection of the poison of hatred into men’s minds by means of falsehood is a greater evil in war-time than the actual loss of life. The defilement of the human mind is worse than the destruction of the human body. A fuller realization of this is essential. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* * * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the generation that has known war is still alive, it is well that they should be given chapter and verse with regard to some of the best-known cries, catchwords, and exhortations by which they were so greatly influenced. As a warning, therefore, this collection is made. -It constitutes only the exposure of a few samples. To cover the whole ground would be impossible. There must have been more deliberate lying in the world from 1914 to 1918 than in any other period of the world’s history. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good deal depends on the quality of the lie. You must have intellectual lies for intellectual people and crude lies for popular consumption, but if your popular lies are too blatant and your more intellectual sections are shocked and see through them, they may (and indeed they did) begin to be suspicious as to whether they were not being hoodwinked too. Nevertheless, the inmates of colleges are just as credulous as the inmates of the slum. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* * * * *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Exposure, therefore, may be useful, even when the struggle is over, in order to show up the fraud, hypocrisy, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">humbug on which all war rests,</span><span class="font7"> and the blatant and vulgar devices which have been used for so long to prevent the poor, ignorant people from realizing the true meaning of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It must be admitted that many people were conscious and willing dupes. But many more were unconscious and were sincere in their patriotic zeal. Finding now that elaborately and carefully staged deceptions were practised on them, they feel a resentment which has not only served to open their eyes but may induce them to make their children keep their eyes open when next the bugle sounds. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is no plea that lies should not be used in war-time, but a demonstration of how lies </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">must </span><span class="font7">be used in war-time. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If the truth ivere told from the outset, there ivould be no reason and no will for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any one declaring the truth: “Whether you are right or wrong, whether you win or lose, in no circumstances can war help you or your country,” would find himself in gaol very quickly. In war-time, failure to lie is negligence, the doubting of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> lie a misdemeanour, the declaration of the truth a crime. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the people of one country understand how the people in another country are duped, like themselves, in war-time, they will be more disposed to sympathize with them as victims than condemn them as criminals, because they will understand that their crime only consisted in obedience to the dictates of authority and acceptance of what their government and press represented to them as the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The period covered is roughly the four years of the war. The intensity of the lying was mitigated after 1918, although fresh crops came up in connection with other of our international relations. The mischief done by the false cry “Make Germany pay” continued after 1918 and led, more especially in France, to high expectations and consequent indignation when it was found that the people who raised this slogan knew all the time it was a fantastic impossibility. Many of the old war lies survived for several years, and some survive even to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* * * # *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is nothing sensational in the way of revelations contained in these pages. All the cases mentioned are well known to those who were in authority, less well known to those primarily affected, and unknown, unfortunately, to the millions who fell. Although only a small part of the vast field of falsehood is covered, it may suffice to show how the unsuspecting- innocence of the masses in all countries was ruthlessly and systematically exploited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are some who object to war because of its immorality; there are some who shrink from the arbitrament of arms because of its increased cruelty and barbarity; there are a growing number who protest against this method, at the outset known to be unsuccessful, of attempting to settle international disputes because of its imbecility and futility. But there is not a living soul in any country who does not deeply resent having his passions roused, his indignation inflamed, his patriotism exploited, and his highest ideals desecrated by concealment, subterfuge, fraud, falsehood, trickery, and deliberate lying on the part of those in whom he is taught to repose confidence and to whom he is enjoined to nay respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">None of the heroes prepared for suffering and sacrifice, none of the common herd ready for service and obedience, will be inclined to listen to the call of their country once they discover the polluted sources from whence that call proceeds and recognize the monstrous finger of falsehood which beckons them to the battlefield.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Twenty Years Ago in New York</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">WENTY years ago in New York, according to Upton Sinclair’s book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Metropolis,</span><span class="font7"> there were 'women in New York society who employed expert nurses for their dogs, besides a footman, and a special cuisine. These dogs had a regular dentist, and a physician, and gold plate to eat from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of these dogs went out driving, with a coachman and a footman. There were dog nurseries and 1’esting rooms in which they might be left temporarily, and manicure parlors for cats, with a physician in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were umbrellas for dogs, to be fastened over their backs in wet weather, manicure and toilet sets for them, silver medicine chests for them, and jewel-studded whips. There were sets of engraved visiting cards for dogs, and wheel-chairs in which invalid cats and dogs might be taken for an airing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a woman who came all the way from the Pacific Coast to have a specialist perform an operation upon the throat of her Yorkshire terrier! There was another who built for her dog a Queen Anne cottage, with rooms papered and carpeted and hung with lace curtains!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was a cat with a life-pension from a $40,000 estate. It had a two-floor apartment and several attendants, sat at a table and ate shrimps and Italian chestnuts, and had a velvet couch for naps and a fur-lined basket in which to sleep at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New York was very modest and sensible in its tastes and expenditures twenty years ago,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">compared with what it is now. The interest system is a great thing. There are tens of thousands of human beings in New York who are only one jump away from starvation all the time. New York needs Christ’s kingdom, and is going to get it whether it Avants it or not. That • is the best part of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A GENTLEMAN who works for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> success</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ful concern in the Middle West writes us regarding the methods that are employed in making his company a 100-percenter in the community and Red Cross drives. Despite the specter of death and disease stalking through his home, he dares not give his name for fear of losing his job. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The wages paid are very inadequate to maintain the average worker’s family, which results in much suffering. Yet, as you will'note by enclosed clipping, they are able to. pay quite a healthy dividend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The general wage scale varies from forty-five cents an hour to fifty-five cents an hour. Machine operators receive from fifty-live to sixty cents an hour; a very select few receive fair wages (such as seventy-five to eighty-five cents). These consist of tool makers, foremen, straw bosses, and a few favored individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'They employ approximately 700 men, women and girls. The girls are paid from thirteen to fifteen dollars a week. Nine hours a day prevails throughout the factory; five days, and one-half day on Saturday, weekly. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The factory is nicely located, well lighted and ventilated and heated. The workers can either stand or sit at their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'The officials are constantly seeking ways and means to increase production, among which are the suggestion boxes, conveniently located throughout the factory, in which the workers place their suggestions and, if accepted by the committee, are paid from three to five dollars for same. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'To this end also are cards posted in conspicuous places at intervals, bearing such sayings as follows: ‘Failure of the Avorker to think. It becomes necessary to employ others to think for you and to receive part of your pay.’ This is the gist of thought in the last card posted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“'Each year the management sends the foremen and bosses to the ‘slaves’ (for that is Avhat the Avorkers are) to broAvbeat, intimidate and threaten them to give a day’s pay to the community chest, and to sign a card authorizing the company to deduct one day’s pay every year Avhile employed by the company. Also, every one </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">who</span><span class="font7"> obtains employment noAv must sign said card. This system began in the spring of 1928. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They will not take ‘No’ for an answer, but must ‘go over’ 100-percent. Not even if you plead pewerty, as I did, and tell them that you have enough community chest at home. I had no less than four conferences with the officials, who even pried into my personal matters and wanted to know whom I owed, and criticized me because I owned a radio, and said I shouldn’t have bought it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This was last spring. I was finally compelled to sign the card in order to keep Avorking, as they threatened loss of employment, and I could not take any such chances Avitlr a family of five to support and a sick girl </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">who</span><span class="font7"> is no doubt on tier death-bed with t. b.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“One thing I did do. In signing the card I erased the clause which made it perpetual, and made it good only for 1928. So I am wondering Avhat they will do this spring (1929).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Oh, yes, they are 100-percent for the Red Cross, but they are not even one percent for the cross of Christ. Of course you couldn’t expect anything else. Just a ferv weeks ago they came Avith the Red Cross and said, ‘Well, -----</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">, we</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">want $1.00 out of you for the Red Cross. We are going to put her over 100-percent/</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I said emphatically, ‘No, not one cent from, me!’ They said,‘You can afford it easily. Only tAventy-five cents a Aveek until the dollar is paid/ I said positively, ‘No!’ and asked them </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">How</span><span class="font7"> the management would like it if I would introduce some such program for the poor and demand 100 percent and would not take ‘No’ for an answer. I said they would promptly introduce me to the toe of their shoe. I insisted on my stand, and they did not like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This is how they retaliate. Before the holidays I came down with the flu and lost a week’s work as a result, and loss of the week’s pay made it necessary to ask for an advance on my second week’s pay, which was already earned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“So I approached my foreman on the question. He began about my failure to sign for the Red Cross and that because of this it went down </span><span class="font6">on the books against me and I am considered no good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The foreman said he would not have this against his name, not for a ten-dollar bill. And he said he didn’t know whether he could do anything for me or not, notwithstanding that I have a nineteen-year-old girl on what will doubtless prove her death-bed, as the doctor says there is no hope for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is funny that there has not been a representative here of either the Community Chest or the Red Cross; neither do I expect any. However, they finally granted me ten dollars advance as requested.”</span></p>

It also operates its own hotels, some at sea-level, probably the highest being at Lake Louise, Alta., 5,670 feet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Largest Railway System in America” brings to mind the Canadian National Railways. It maintains eleven radio stations to supply news and music to its de luxe train passengers while en route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Standard Railroad of the World” refers to the Pennsylvania Railroad, which “carries more passengers, hauls more freight, than any other railroad in America”. They changed the name of their “St. Louisan” to “Spirit of St. Louis”, to commemorate Colonel Lindbergh’s transatlantic airplane flight, Mrs. Lindbergh appropriately being on the first trip from New York to St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Standard Railroad of the South” refers to the Atlantic Coast Line, while the Seaboard Air Line uses “Through the heart of the South”, and the Southern Railway takes for its slogan “Serves the South”. The “Water Level Route” makes you think of the New York Central; the “Road of Anthracite”, the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp;&nbsp;Western; “A mill to the mile,” the Piedmont and Northern Railway; while the Chicago &amp;&nbsp;Alton uses “The Only Way”. They further advertise on their time-tables “perfect passenger service”. What can be better?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Crookedest Railroad in the World” is the Mt. Tamalpais &amp;&nbsp;Muir Woods Railway, of California. This slogan has no reference except to the track, which has 281 &quot;curves and climbs about 2,600 feet to the summit, from which spreads a panorama of the Muir Woods (with its giant Sequoia trees), San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you travel over the “Land of Evangeline Route”, which is the Dominion Atlantic Railway, you must, of course, go to Nova Scotia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some other slogans are the following: “The Noiseless Route,” Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railway; “Oil Belt Route,” used jointly by the Wichita Falls, Ranger &amp;&nbsp;Fort Worth R.

<p><span class="font7">“The National Park Line” refers to the Burlington Route, the locomotives of which have speed recorders, to promote regulated, uniform speed, and whistles that are musical. This railroad serves the Black Hills, and explains that they are really green with forests of pine, blue with spruce, and gray with some of the most remarkable and interesting granite formations to be found anywhere; also that nature gave them foundations of gold and silver, copper, tin, lead and mica. At Lead, S. Dak., is found the great Homestake mine, the richest gold mine in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Central Railroad of New Jersey has the largest and longest four-track drawbridge in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Baltimore &amp;&nbsp;Ohio was the first railroad built in America for public transportation of passengers and freight. The first American-built locomotive was the B. &amp;&nbsp;0. “Tom Thumb.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Wabash Ry. Co. advertises that it has the “train of trains”. Its slogan is, &quot;Follow the Flag.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE capitalistic papers of England (it is hard to find a daily paper that is not run by capitalistic power) howl down the coal miner when he strikes for his rights. They give the public the impression that the miner is an unreasonable, bull-brained individual who is never content; and the sheep-like man in the street, taking all that is printed in the newspaper as gospel truth, proceeds to judge the miner harshly without making the slightest endeavor to prove matters for himself or to see the other side of the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Coal mining is hard work; no man can say that it is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have on my desk, right now, particulars from a lad of nineteen years of age who is employed in a mine in England. This youth has to walk six miles to the pit-head, and after he is let down in the cage he has a further three to four miles to walk underground to his task on the seam face. His wages during September of this year, after various stoppages were made for insurance, etc., came to £3:1:4. I have taken these figures from the boy’s official pay chits. For this meager wage he has had to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">work.</span><span class="font7"> Only those who know the mining life know how that lad has had to work, and from these few dollars he must clothe and feed himself, besides giving a little to his mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is easy for the easy-chair critic to look upon these honest toilers as bull-brained brutes who don’t know when they are well off; but we all look forward eagerly to the coming of an allloving government headed by the Premier of all premiers, the Son of God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark38"></a>The Farmer Must Be Adequately Remunerated </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By I. B. Alford</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE public recognizes today the fundamental right of an individual to organize and operate in his own way, without interference, any legitimate business enterprises in which he may choose to engage. The perpetuation of former centuries-old family traditions which prevailed in the old country, and which yet prevail there to some extent, requiring incoming generations to maintain the caste system by pursuing only those occupations of their fathers, is no longer in vogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early in the history of America these traditions were held in contempt, and were smashed upon the rock of opportunity. As a result many former rag-tags of newsboys, peddling papers on the street, are now publishers and owners of plants the values of which are reckoned in the millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sons of blacksmiths are reversing the fortunes of their fathers by aspiring to and attaining to positions as directors or presidents of railroad companies whose lines belt the continent from ocean to ocean. The errand boy in yesterday’s village store may today be a merchant prince with his chain of stores in a dozen or more cities. The captains of today’s industries are the result of yesterday’s opportunity to organize and operate a private or public business project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">~ Under this plan of operation, the results have, without exception, been attained under mass production, with the uninterrupted privilege of profitable sale of such production. This is true in all matters of sale, from toothpicks to steam shovels, or from wheelbarrows to limousines and locomotives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, by common consent, the public concedes and insists upon this plan as being indispensable in the successful maintenance of any business enterprise. This plan of mass production, and the conceded right of profitable sale of such production, is the only known route to possible success in any undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is true that at times it has been necessary for the government to exercise its police functions to prevent excessive profits, under the Sherman Antitrust Law; but even here the right of profitable sale has never been infringed by such police function. It was only the excessive profit that was designed to be held in check. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This right of profitable sale, under economical cost of production, is an inalienable right,^t being the only possible guarantee of the continued successful operation of such enterprise. Denial of this right is the first step to failure of such enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Farming is a business, just the same as railroading, merchandising, banking, mining or manufacturing. Just as in all other business, the success of farming is determined by mass production and profitable sale of such production. And this is the “farm problem” about which so much is being written today. So long as farmers and ranchmen are compelled to take a course running counter to that of all other business men, that is, are denied the right of profitable sale of their output, this will continue to be the farm problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Indeed it is becoming the national problem. This nation will perpetuate itself in both existence and prosperity only in proportion to the prosperity of all its essential industries. And farming takes first rank in importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This problem can not be disposed of by resolutions of Congress, nor by speeches of high-salaried wind-jammers who appear to be afflicted with the habit of qualifying as experts on marketing. Neither can the solution be very much longer postponed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general public must concede the farmer a legitimate profit, and must think and plan and legislate to that end. The nation can not perpetuate itself half bond and half free. This is essentially an agricultural nation, and farming must be made to pay or the nation will perish.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Q</span><span class="font7">UITE recently a college professor and a school superintendent were occupying two turned-apart seats in a passenger coach crowded to capacity; in other words, they were hogging four seats on two one-seat tickets and were discussing school matters, mostly the athletic features. They were being overheard by the writer, who occupied an adjoining seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The conversation shifted to a singing contest. The college professor explained that one of the girls of the contest was the daughter of one of the college trustees, and another of the girls was the daughter of one of the citizens of the town, and that the decision rested between these two girls. He explained, “We gave the decision to the daughter of the trustee.” “Of course!” agreed the superintendent, with smug assurance of policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The college professor went on to say, “The mother of the other girl came to me, vigorously protesting against the decision. She declared that her daughter was by far the better singer, and that everybody was so saying, and that she should have gotten the award. I told that mother that her daughter was of course the better singer of the two; but policy decreed otherwise, and that although her girl failed of getting the award, that does not impair her singing quality in the least. She is just as good a singer as she was before the contest.” And the superintendent nodded assent. -</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark43"></a>A Warden With a Heart</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">L</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ewis</span><span class="font7"> E. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lawes,</span><span class="font7"> for eight years warden of Sing Sing prison, New York, believes that the men in prison are no different from the men outside. As a consequence he has been a great success as a warden. In a'book narrating his experiences he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Crime is rarely a one-sided proposition; guilt rarely entirely personal. Responsibility must, in most instances, be shared by society, which takes credit for a man’s virtues and should by the same token acknowledge at least some of the blame for his vices. The newspapers and movies must, in many instances, share a good deal of the responsibility of crime, but so too must the schools, the churches and many thoughtless fathers, indulgent mothers, vain wives, underpaying employers, dishonest politicians, usurious bankers, grasping money-lenders, etc. In several cases of men who have been sent to Sing Sing in connection with big business failures, the failures were due to payments of high interest rates to grasping money-lenders, who were themselves complainants, although they had actually received in interest more than they had loaned, and were therefore only nominal losers in the failures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sing Sing does not have the discipline characterized by the lock-step, striped suit, silence, and shaved heads, but has good businesslike order and excellent morale. The prisoners in the shops are not handled as prisoners, but as workmen. There are no guards with guns standing on a raised dais and shouting curses. One sees in the shops a group of laborers busy at their tasks, with here and there a civilian instructor or foreman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who think of the criminal as he is usually portrayed in fiction may find it difficult to think of him as having any of the characteristics of a hero. As a matter of fact, I know of a number of former prisoners who distinguished themselves for bravery in the late war, and there are now in Sing Sing several men who have received high decorations for fearlessness and heroism. More than 20 per cent of our present population have seen service in defense of our nation’s flag. If I should ever need a man upon whose courage I would rely in the face of the gravest danger, I know hundreds of men—prisoners and exprisoners—upon whom I would stake my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prisoners are, as a rule, generous—-many of them to a fault. On the outside, they have been generous to their friends and good to their mothers. Within the walls, they will share their last bite or last Lucky or Camel with any fellow-prisoner. If any man is unable to do his work, fellow-prisoners will give him a lift. I have even known men to assume the blame and take punishment for something they had not done, in order to protect a prisoner friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the mere imprisonment itself is real punishment is brought out by the warden as follow’s:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If any one doubts this fact, let him imagine himself in the finest hotel in the world, but absolutely limited to its confines without privilege of leaving, even for an hour, over a period of a year, five years, or ten years. No luxury it might afford, no comfort, no pleasures—with the unlimited privilege of receiving all visitors who might call or the freedom to communicate at will with friends by mail and telephone—would offset the loss of freedom. This would be real punishment to any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now substitute for the room in the finest hotel a narrow, dark, cold cell in a building that has been condemned as unsanitary for more than sixty years; and for the luxuries of the hotel fare, meals which cost only twenty-one cents per day. Add labor on the coal pile, or in poorly lighted shops, with out-of-date machinery, for a daily wage of one and a half cents. Then limit the visits received to one a week, and place a limit and a censorship on both outgoing and incoming mail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">NE hundred years ago the Chinese were giving the outside world little trouble, and probably would have continued to do so had the outside nations left them alone. The market for commercial and religious wares, however, proved too tempting. Some folks couldn’t bear the idea of China going to hell in ignorance of the gospel, while others couldn’t bear the idea of her going to heaven without modern equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Missionaries and treaties were forced upon her, the control of many of her ports was taken over by foreign governments and if she dared to so much as murmur a protest </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christian guns were turned against her to prove how fiery the new gospel</span><span class="font7"> really was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The western world has had a rather enjoyable time lording it over China. Her cheap labor made it possible to buy many raw materials at a low price, while her helpless condition made it possible to force faith, opium and other things down her throat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Napoleon seems to have been about the only statesman of his time who realized what the end of the game might be. He said that China was a sleeping giant and those should beware who waked her.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark46"></a>An Astronomical Reverie </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Prof. Dr. Andersson</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">(Translated from the German)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font7">UR present-day telescopes magnify merely with the help of optical means. Thereby considerable limitations, which have already been nearly reached by our technical arts, are placed against their perfection. That does not mean, however, that we shall always be dependent upon these optical means only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we wish to discover something very small and we succeed in transforming one step in the procedure of search into an electrical function, we can thus obtain magnifications which, could never be obtained by any other means. Picking up and making audible the little radio waves is a significant example of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Therefore, if one of these days we should succeed in transforming part of the process of seeing through the telescope into an electrical function, there could be obtained in this manner magnifications of which we would hardly dream today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That would mean, first of all, that we would see much more accurately the celestial bodies already visible hitherto, and besides would discover innumerable ones hitherto unknown. Even this -would be of incalculable importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But there would supervene an unexpected, even more far-reaching result. Light requires one second to travel 186,400 miles. Therefore, from the sun to the earth it requires eight minutes. Thus, whoever looks at the earth from the sun would see there what had transpired on the earth eight minutes before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If, on some celestial body not too far from the earth, we could find a reflecting surface, such as a crystal ledge or a piece of molten metal, and could examine with the help of our imaginary supertelescope the reflection therefrom cast back upon the earth, we would see therein that which was transpiring upon the earth at a time as long preceding as is required for light to travel from the earth to said celestial body and from there back again to earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suppose we choose for an example the fixed star Polaris, which is so far from the earth that light from the earth requires seventy-five years to reach this star. A natural mirror upon it would show us events which had taken place upon earth 150 [=2X75] years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since there are stars at all possible distances from the earth, we would be enabled by means of our supertelescope to study the entire world’s history backwards. We could, for instance, see from our observatory how Columbus discovers America and how Caesar crosses the Rubicon. We would settle with ease thousandyear-old historical disputes, correct deep-rooted errors, and the most ancient beginnings of Egyptian and Babylonian history would hold no more secrets from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A mirror in the Magellanic Clouds (Nubeculae) would carry us back to the earliest stone age. Since, according to latest discoveries, there are several planets which are a million lightyears away from us, these would reflect the condition in which our earth was two million years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We would not seem too unreasonable just now, but fantastic as it may appear at first thought, namely, that we should ever again look upon the “lost world” of the long ago, yet this lies positively within the range of the most reasonable possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even as one generation ago one would not have imagined it possible to hear as music from a microphone the tiny waves produced miles away, so it might be that even the next generation may in the same matter-of-course manner reel oft motion pictures of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At least, our meditation will disclose to the reader what distances we have to take into consideration in the universe, and that nothing that happens is totally lost, even if -we should be unable to make it visible for ourselves again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">American “Religion”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> Yes. The Lord is always much better pleased with the good heart condition of faith and trust in Him. When the Lord told Samuel to anoint one of the sons of Jesse as king over Israel, He did not tell the prophet to select the-best-looking son or the son who had the best clothing. No. God told Samuel, as stated in 1 Samuel 16:7, “The Lord seetli not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” The scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day loved to dress very conspicuously and to appear very pious, to be seen of men. Jesus said that they were an abomination in the Lord’s sight. In Mark 12:38-40 we read, “Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the market-places, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts; which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.” The difficulty with the scribes was that they, through appearance and ceremony, sought the praises of men rather than to be pleasing to God. It is true that “the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart”. Jesus warned the Jews against the scribes and Pharisees, who oppressed the poor and widows with the collection of money, and -who sought praise for themselves rather than the honor of God. Jesus said, in Matthew 23:2-9, “The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat: ... do not ye after their works:. for they say, and do not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">For they bind heavy burdens, be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.” The same principle that held in the days of the Prophet Samuel, and later in the days of Jesus, is still good: “The Lord seeth not as man seetli; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> God created Adam and Eve in the exact form of man and woman in a reasonably short time. In Genesis 2:7 we read, &quot;And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” Scientific analysis of the human body has proved that all the elements found in the body are present in the soil of the earth. In Psalm 100:3 we read, &quot;Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves.” Another statement is found in Isaiah 64: 8. “But now, 0</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Lord, thou art our father: we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we are all the work of thy hand.” The theory of evolution is not supported by the true scientific facts of nature; for each species of animal, including man, tends to hold to his own unchangeable kind; and in a few generations crosses between two kinds revert to the original strains.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> My boy often asks me, “Where is Jesus ?” Shall I tell him ‘in his heart’ or ‘in heaveri?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font7"> The boy may be told that according to the Scriptures Jesus as a powerful spirit being is even now present in the earth. Fulfilled prophecy and Bible chronology clearly show that Christ has returned and that during this</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">time of trouble, which began in 1914, He is breaking up the Devil’s organization, both visible and invisible, and at the same time is setting up His kingdom which is soon to bless all the peoples of earth. The disciples of Jesus were curious to know the evidences or signs of His second presence, and asked Him the question stated in Matthew 24:3, &quot;What shall be the sign of thy coming </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[parousia,</span><span class="font7"> presence], and of the end of the world?” In giving answer to this question Jesus said that ‘nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom; famines, epidemics (such as the influenza) ; revolutions in different parts of the earth; the Jews returning to Palestine; and the gospel of the kingdom being preached by His followers’—these would be proofs of His second presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now mark you, all of these events have been in the course of fulfilment since 1914, for the first time in earth’s history. In Daniel 12:1, 4 we read, “And at that time shall Michael [Christ Jesus, who is God’s representative] stand up [begin to reign], the great prince which stand-eth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there, was a nation even to that same time. . . .

What shall the people do? Let each one who wishes to take a wise course say this: T am sick and disgusted with the old order with its wars, sin, hypocrisy and death. I am for the Lord and His kingdom. Henceforth I will serve the Lord Jehovah., and He is my salvation,’</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font7">HATTERING, laughing, we walked in the vast garden, near to .the palace of the League of Nations. Happy Esperantists wandered through, the garden, admiring the magnificent landscape which the Lemana Lake presented, surrounded by mountains and blindingly reflecting the last golden rays of the setting sun. A certain enthusiasm of joy, which one was not able to feel everywhere and always, a certain delight impelled us, like little children, to wander from flower-bed to flower-bed and from cluster of trees to another grove, in a carefree manner. Finally we stopped at a small public square, in the center of which was found a certain object. We drew near and regarded it eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon two poles a bronze object was suspended, the top of which was ornamented with dragons, serpents and puzzling hieroglyphics. It was covered with a green protection. It was something very interesting, alluring, &quot;What is it?” “What can it be?” came forth the questions. One of us delicately hit the bronze object with the finger. A. beautiful-sounding hum, as if a low, far away echo of a certain sound. We gently struck it again. Again sounded the humming noise, mysterious, sighing. A certain kind of bell! “Let us ring it!” cried some. “Yes, a bell,” broke in a certain voice, “a bell, sent as a gift from China to the League of Nations, in order that it may ring out when peace may begin to reign upon the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mischievousness left us. Respectfully we walked away from the bronze object. To call forth its sound now, when the odor of blood is yet rising throughout the air, when serpents of hate hiss ever and anon in the marshes of intolerance, would be to profane the bell.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Freeman, </span><span class="font7">Kingston, Ontario, gives the situation away in an editorial on “The Eastern Churches”, in which these statements are made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some idea of the division of the schismatic churches can be obtained by enumerating them. The so-called Orthodox Church, second largest body in Christendom, is divided into sixteen different branches, possessing varying degrees of independence from the Orthodox body.

<p><span class="font5">The Copts, who form the Church of Egypt; the Church of Abyssinia, or Ethiopia; the Jacobites, of Syria; the Malabar Christians in India; and the Armenian Church are all heretical sects, having embraced Monophysitism, a heresy which denied the dual nature of Christ.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Omnivorous Animal, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Man By C. J. W., Jr.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">INCE Adam’s day man has subsisted on an immense variety of foods. The human system has found delectation and nourishment in a wide range of substances extending from the delicate meat of the eel to the coarse, sour, black rye bread of the peasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of late the interest in diet has increased to such an extent, that one finds almost daily accounts of some new system of eating purporting to be the ideal combination of foods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These diet systems cover the list of oddities in gastronomic “imbibables”, as well as that of solid foods, and recommend the drinking of vegetable juices, fruit juices, berry juices, milk exclusively, water exclusively, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We find on close perusal of these pseudo-dietetic works that many of them are written by persons quite unfamiliar with the actual facts of human physiology. Let us be wary to avoid the snares of fanaticism which lie ready to trip up the adventurous wight who delves into dietetics </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sans</span><span class="font7"> a knowledge of his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is amusing and bewildering to note the many and various methods of corrective eating prescribed by these theorists. Some of them are strongly enlisted in the cause of vegetarianism ; others cast opprobrium upon the heads of all who deny that man’s natural food is milk; still others come to the fore with the manifesto that a human being should enjoy himself at the festive board with nuts and water; and then there are those whose goal is reached when they have fasted themselves and their patients into early graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the number of conjectures relative to the construction and operation of the body are legion. From the characteristic effects of certain foods upon the body, and in the results accruing from other causes and attributed to these foods, many of the dietetic theories with which we are today harassed had their* inception. We are told on one hand that the body is a chemical plant and its operations are all chemical reactions, hence proper food combinations are important. Very good I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another quarter we hear that the body is a great machine, working on mechanical principles, and here again the question of proper food combinations is of paramount importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From a different source we are informed that the body is a vast electrical laboratory and that the combination of foods is a very important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And lastly, from the dim perspective emerges a theory giving to the body the properties of a rubber bag, requiring correct distension and contraction for a condition of normalcy which can be obtained only by a proper combination of food!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So there it stands; with these multifarious theories about the body, many partially correct, a few laughably wrong, what is the average poor fellow to do when his physiological indica-. tors tell him something is wrong and he is a sick man'?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Intelligent examination of these theories will disclose that in most of them some element of truth exists, and that all the theorists, though ready and willing to garrote fellow theorists on every other point, unanimously agree on the importance of food combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The simple facts which all should know about the amazingly complicated, yet smoothly-running and simply-maintained human body, are at our fingers’ ends, and in- this day and age ignorance of the construction and operation of one’s body is inexcusable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human body is an exquisitely proportioned and perfectly harmonized combination of the three elemental sciences of electricity, chemistry, and mechanics. For illustration, the nervous system, carrying life force to every muscle, bone, and organ in the body, is in reality the body’s electric system, for it has long been known past all possibility of contradiction that the analogy between electric current along a wore and nervous current along a nerve, is complete and perfect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The main chemical plant of the body is the stomach, where, besides hydrochloric acid and sodium bicarbonate, there are many highly complex chemical reagents manufactured from the blood stream to dissolve the food taken into the body. And there are the liver* and the pancreas, besides all the ductless glands, miniature chemical laboratories, each with its separate department, and each turning out, in health, its allotted quantity of specific within the twenty-four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the mechanical aspect of the body is fully as wonderful and beautiful as its.electrical and chemical characteristics. Most of us are familiar with the ball-and-socket joints at shoulder and hip, the hinge joints of the jaws, the swivel joint at the apex of the neck, the marvelous complex swivel of the wrist, and the beautiful rippling peristaltic action of the intestines which forces food through their entire length for digestion and fecal matter for ultimate ejection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And last but not least, consider the vermiform appendix, once thought a useless organ, but proven by actual X-ray observation to be the little crank which is &quot;set” at the beginning of digestion in the stomach and, at the opening of the pylorus valve, gives the starting impetus necessary to peristalsis in the intestinal tract. When this organ is diseased and removed through an operation, normal peristalsis is permanently interfered with, resulting in alternate periods of constipation and diarrhea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of this article is not to propound any new theory of eating. The writer thinks that the present score or more of such theories are sufficient to supply the human race with perplexity enough to last for a considerable t</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font7">e, and that his own personal ideas of diet set forth here would be superfluous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is clear proof that man is not created an exclusive meat, fruit, vegetable, or nut eater, or an exclusive milk, water, or juice drinker. The very fact that man possesses knife-like teeth to cut with, fang-like teeth to tear with, and flat-topped teeth to grind with, establishes without question man’s position as an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">omnivorous</span><span class="font7"> animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord Jesus, when He was upon the earth, ate of the flesh of lamb, and fish; and He also ate corn (grains) and bread, and drank wine, as well as water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the commands given to Moses by Jehovah, various animals and birds were designated as food for man, and others were listed as unfit. Of those considered clean and wholesome for the people of Israel, we of this day use all: the sheep, the cow, and various domestic fowl. It is highly improbable that when perfect conditions are once again established in the earth, people will cease to eat of the flesh of sheep and cows and the domestic fowls, and fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition, to their food value, the domestic beasts are of incalculable economic importance to man; and in consideration of the fact of several billions of humans about to be reinstated to their normal condition of life and activity, it is not thinkable that the great Jehovah would countenance the extermination of the useful domestic animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time is promised as coming soon, when 'every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and none shall molest or make him afraid’. And we may safely add, that, within easy distance of his cheerful cot there will be a well-stocked stream, where the man may vary his diet of fruit and vegetable with delicious fish, and there will be in his yard materials for occasional juicy beefsteaks or plump roast chickens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unquestionably man will have learned, during the next thousand years, the right </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">amount </span><span class="font7">of food to eat each day, and the proper combinations in a meal, and also to take his meat occasionally and in moderate quantities. There will be no inordinate appetites for one kind of food, nor gluttonous desire for three or four meals daily, when perfection again reigns in the earth. Man will eat for pleasure and delectation of the senses, of course; but this natural desire, running uncurbed and distorted in most of us at present, will then be regulated by common sense and the specific requirements of the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The point we would impress upon those thoughtful persons who will read what has here been written, is this: Don’t take your life in your hands by following blindly the recommendations of any one theoretical dietician. From the mass of available material at hand, select those items which appear to fit your case the most closely, and which savor the most of common sense. Avoid sensationalistic regimens of food combinations that are prepared chiefly for those who think they are invalids, and which are a species of fetish, nothing more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Avoid the rabid extremists who declare against meat. Nebuchadnezzar subsisted on. grass exclusively for several years, but during all that time he was crazy. When the Lord in His goodness restored Nebuchadnezzar’s reason to him, the man at once resumed the diet of a human being, which is necessarily varied. It is worthy of note that King Neb’s exclusively vegetarian experience did not restore his sanity. [Nor was it what made him crazy. Daniel and his three companions avoided the &quot;king’s meat” which the king ate before turning crazy. (Dan. 1:8-20)—Ed.] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is further worthy of consideration that no</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">sacrifice which the priests of the temple of Jehovah could make was more acceptable than a young lamb, freshly killed, and offered upon the altar as a burnt offering. Let the editor of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Green Leaf,</span><span class="font7"> an Australian vegetarian publication, who once spoke of meat as “animal corpse”, mark the following significant fact: In every instance where the conditions laid down by Him had been complied with, Almighty God </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">accepted</span><span class="font7"> the sacrifice of the burnt offering, showing His acceptance by consuming the sacrificial lamb with fire from heaven. Apparently the respected editor’s ideal burnt offering would be a cabbage or a stalk of celery!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Obesity </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By H. Sillaway</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">N</span><span class="font7">O ONE is overfat by choice, and it is a decidedly unpleasant condition, to say the least, to which, nevertheless, most corpulent people seem to be resigned because they consider it an unavoidable affliction for which there is no help. Of late years there has been much written on the subject; but the advice given has not always been either satisfactory or wise, owing to the fact that most authorities apparently fail to recognize the root of the trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While obesity is not usually recognized as a disease, especially by the victim of it, it is really so. The overfat person is sick, however well he may fancy himself to be, and stands but a slim chance of seeing old age. To attempt starving off surplus flesh is nothing less than sheer folly. Temporary relief may result from this method of treatment, but such weakening of the system only serves to aggravate the root trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is useless to undertake the cure of any disease condition by merely treating the symptoms. The cutting out of carbohydrates from the diet on the theory that they are fat builders is little short of suicidal. True, most people eat an excess of these, especially in our day of refined foods, and this is probably true of all who are afflicted with this trouble; but a percentage of these food elements is necessary to health, and fat people are no exception to this rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That obesity can be cured there is little question; and its cure lies principally in dietetic habits, not in the unreasonable avoidance of carbohydrates. The cause of obesity apparently lies in a weakness of the crude energy refining organism of the body, the ductless glands. Most people suppose that digested foods assimilated into the circulation are ready for immediate use as blood and tissue builders without any further processes; but that is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Food is converted by the digestive processes into crude energy which is taken up by the circulation and passed through the ductless glands where it undergoes certain necessary changes before it can be utilized by the system for its purpose. In obesity these glands in a measure fall down on the job and fail to properly refine and distribute this energy, which, as a consequence, tends to clog the system because of its unavailable character. The piling up of surplus fat is the natural result of the effort of the system to minimize and counteract the influence of this improperly refined energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To cure this difficulty it is absolutely necessary to strengthen these important glands by lifting all surplus load from them by cutting out all improper foods and drinks and in the use of a balanced and nutritious diet. In addition to this, plenty of active exercise should be taken and the disposition to sleep too much should be curbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is useless to attempt the cure of this trouble while using tea, coffee, pork and pork products. These must be cut entirely from the diet. In fact, practically all flesh fats should be avoided, and fresh butter should be used as much as possible in the place of these. Vegetable shortenings, used in moderation where butter in sufficient quantities is difficult to obtain, are allowable in most cases. Oleo should not be used, corn syrups should be tabooed, and condiments should be used very sparingly, if at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The diet should be mostly vegetable, though one or two meals a week of fish or other sea food is beneficial. Fresh lean meats once a week, if desired, will probably do no harm in ordinary cases; but the nearer one follows a vegetable diet, aside from the sea foods mentioned, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this we are exempting, of course, milk, butter and eggs, all of which are proper and beneficial foods, though we suggest that in diet for obesity, buttermilk be used in place of sweet</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">milk</span><span class="font7"> when it can be obtained good and fresh. White bread should not be eaten; and refined sugars should be used very sparingly, and better if not at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sugars are necessary to good health, and people inclined to obesity need them as well as others; but they should be in the crude form. The refining process takes away practically all their valuable food elements except carbon, which has little value alone other than in the production of heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ordinarily one will not eat to excess of these crude sugars, if the refined article is not used. Where crude sugars can not be obtained, raisins and dates should be used freely. New Orleans molasses and sorghum are valuable forms of crude sugars. The ordinary brown sugars on the market are not crude sugars, though the darker grades of these are only partially refined and are preferable to the white and light grades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People who are overfat should use plenty of green vegetables and acid fruits. These are an important part of a reducing diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In following the dietetic rules here given, quick and miraculous results should not be expected. It will take time to strengthen the weak glands of the body and thereby correct this deep-seated difficulty, and no perceptible falling off in weight should be looked for in less than three to eight months. But a reduction in weight must and will result from a persistent adherence to proper dietetic and hygienic rules. Never use drugs for reducing, as they only diminish the vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In dieting for obesity we can not emphasize too strongly the importance of avoiding the foods and drinks which we have herein noted must be abstained from. In addition to these it is hardly necessary to mention that the use of alcoholic drinks and tobacco in all forms is decidedly detrimental.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In obesity, as well as in all other forms of persistent chronic affections, it is well to consult a competent spinal specialist for examination for trunk nerve pressure. Where this exists the system will not readily respond to diet in the overcoming of these troubles. Comparatively few people are entirely free from nerve pressure, which directly and indirectly is either* a cause or an influence in probably seventy-five percent of all chronic troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Vaccination </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr, H. R. Rickards </span><span class="font4">(Reprinted from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Quest)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font7">MALLPOX, scarlet and typhoid fever, measles, etc., are simply manifestations of abnormal conditions in the body, the safety valves through which the “vis medicatrix naturae”— the healing power of nature—-rids the system of toxins and wastes that impair its function. In these and other disorders the body actually treats itself, and “therapeutic” measures which are helpful are those that prevent the body from being interfered with during this process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thinking people would rather have smallpox than vaccination, because the latter sows the seed of syphilis, cancers, eczema, erysipelas, scrofula, consumption, even leprosy and many other loathsome affections. Hence the practice of vaccination is a crime, an outrage and a delusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prof. Alfred Russell Wallace, “dean of British scientists,” wrote: “I affirm that vaccination is a gigantic delusion; that it has never saved a single life; but that it has been the cause of much disease, so many deaths, such a vast amount of utterly needless and altogether undeserved suffering that it will be classed by the coming generations among the greatest errors of an ignorant and prejudiced age, and its penal enforcement as the foulest blot on the generally beneficent course of legislation during our century.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prof. Edgar M. Cruikshank, world-famous bacteriologist of King’s College, London, says: “Vaccination is the inoculation of a healthy person with putrid pus, taken from a festering sore on a diseased animal, and of a distinct syphilitic character.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Carl Ruata, Prof. Materia Medica, University Perugia, Italy, stated after citing the disastrous results of the practice in Italy: “Were it not for this calamitous practice, smallpox would have been stamped out years ago and would have wholly disappeared. Believe not in vaccination; it is a world-wide delusion, an unscientific practice, a fatal superstition whose consequences are measured by thousands of dead and wounded; by tears and sorrow without end/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Lippincott, chief surgeon, U. S. Army, in the Philippines: “No other army was ever so thoroughly vaccinated as ours. Vaccination and re-vaccination went on as regularly as the drills,” yet the official report showed that the fatalities for the year 1900 were the highest ever recorded from smallpox in any army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Chas. Creighton, England, a recognized authority in Epidemiology, a pronounced vac-cinist, was selected by the publishers of the Encyclopedia Britannica to write an article on vaccination. To his own surprise and that of the editors, the fifteen-column article resulting from his original and exhaustive investigation was packed with irrefutable proofs of the fallacy of vaccination. It is significant that following the “hue and cry” of the medical profession over Dr. Creighton’s pronouncements, the editors of the said work had a subsequent article prepared by one, mark you, who had an interest in a vaccine farm!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Aluminum Experiences and Observations </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By H. A. Scott</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font7">Y WORK takes me into many homes, where, in the past eighteen months, I have had good opportunities to learn of the experiences of others with aluminum-ware cooking utensils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A friend of mine has a son who is fond of lettuce wilted with bacon, which his mother has been in the habit of preparing in an aluminum pan, letting it stand until ready to serve. The boy was continually bothered with heartburn and stomach trouble, and grew worse as time went on. His father, a subscriber to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> discarded the family’s aluminum cooking utensils. The son recently remarked, “I do not know I have a stomach, and everything agrees with me.” The father’s health also is improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another friend was made sick by eating a pudding which was made in an aluminum pan and allowed to stand in the pan over night. Another told me that in cooking salty meat in an aluminum pan you could actually see the unfavorable change in the meat taking place. Four ladies and one gentleman told me it is impossible to make good tea in an aluminum teapot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was in a grocery. A customer came in and asked for a different brand of coffee, complaining that the brand last purchased was not giving satisfaction. The grocer said: “We have other brands that are fine, but I do not understand why you have failed to get satisfaction with the brand which we consider our best. What kind of percolator have you?” The customer said: “We have a good aluminum percolator.” The grocer replied: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> fear that is where your trouble lies. Go home and throw away your aluminum percolator and get some other kind. I think your troubles will end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another location a clean new gallon kettle, filled with buttermilk in the evening, was black in the morning, and the buttermilk also was black. Twenty aluminum pitchers in which buttermilk was kept week after week were discolored or eaten and appeared to be covered with an ashy substance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A doctor’s wife, who knew something of the danger, carefully read over the instructions sent out with the first aluminum ware. These instructions were to the effect that certain foods should not be cooked in aluminum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A lady who attempted to use her aluminum kettle for dyeing purposes found it so eaten that it had to be sent away to be reconditioned. A hardware clerk told a prospective customer that aluminum is not as good for kitchen utensils as is commonly supposed.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Government</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">[Broadcast from Station WBBR, New York, by Judge Rutherford.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">E</span><span class="font7">VERY honest person should -be interested in good government. Every good government should look well to the general welfare of the people. This series of lectures is for the purpose of enabling the people to have a plain study in the requirements and administration of good government. The combined testimony of the world’s greatest statesmen is that the governments of earth not only are imperfect but generally are corrupt. For centuries men have struggled to establish a good government that would satisfy the desires of the honest. Now it is admitted that all efforts have failed to accomplish such result. There is a reason, and that reason I hope to set forth in these lectures so clearly that all may understand it who so desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year 1914 marked the turning point in the affairs of men. Since then, as never before, the people have appreciated the necessity for a stable government. Prior to that date the peoples of the leading nations had been induced to believe that all war was about done. The argument advanced was that commercial interests of the peoples of the various nations were such that no one nation would dare to go to war with another nation. Suddenly, in 1914, the fires of war were lighted: and within a period of time incredibly short, millions of men were upon the battle-fields slaying each other. Just why they were there no one was able to explain to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In previous times wars were made between tribes about some real or supposed injury; or between communities because of some religious difference; or between peoples relative to the possession of territory. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the war of 1914 all the leading nations of the earth, called Christendom, participated, and that without knowing just why. Some of the nations did not actually engage in fighting, but they suffered almost as much as those that did. That was unlike any other war in the history of man. Every part of every nation involved was required to do its bit. Men and women went to the front. The men fought while the women drove motor cars, served canteens and nursed the sick and wounded. Fighting was carried on under the ground, on top of the ground, under the sea, on the sea, and in the air; and that continued until millions of men poured out their life-blood. At home men and women together manufactured guns, ammunition, airplanes and other instruments of warfare. The food supply of the various governments was taken over by those in. authority, and the peoples were limited in their use of food. Even the babies did their little bit, because their food must be restricted in order that the men at the front might be better supplied. The people 'were compelled to bring their money and exchange it. for the paper obligations of their respective governments. The young men were by law compelled to go to the front and slay their fellow men, while the property of various ones was commandeered for use in war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was literally a war in which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘nation</span><span class="font7"> arose against nation, and kingdom against kingdom’. For four years it raged with indescribable fury: and then, in 1918, the fighting suddenly ceased, and no people or nation had gained a decided victory, and no one was able to state just why the fighting ceased. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nearly nineteen hundred years prior to the beginning of that World War the terrible conflict was foretold in prophecy. A prophecy can be understood when it is fulfilled and the physical facts fit the prophetic words. The great prophecy uttered by Jesus of Nazareth in 33 A.D. was fulfilled from 1914 to 1918. When the smoke of that war had cleared somewhat, then the sober-minded people began to consider the reason for and the meaning of that war. They are learning something and will continue to learn and will profit by their investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A democracy is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. The slogan of the World War was: ’The war will make the world safe for democracy.’ That slogan was adopted and energetically used to induce the people to fight. To that battle-cry the peoples of the nations responded. And why? Because they had a desire for a government that would be administered for and in the interests of the people. They realized the necessity for a stable government in which the rights of the people might be safeguarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of every nation well know now that the ’democracy slogan was a misleading one. The war did not “make the world safe for democracy”. It did not result, in the betterment</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of any people or nation under the sun. Let it be conceded, for the sake of the argument, that the men responsible for the Avar and its prosecution did the best they could, still all must agree that the result of the war was and is unsatisfactory. Nearly a decade after the war the leading statesmen of the world freely express their disappointment at the result. Ramsay MacDonald, a member of the British Parliament, voices the sentiment of many other men when he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. There is no settlement in Europe. There is no peace in Europe. Governments can do nothing. They are afraid to do anything and they stand by and allow things to go from bad to worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Soberly viewing the situation existing long after the war, Mr. Lloyd George said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A new chapter opens in the history of Europe and the world, with a climax of horror such as mankind has never yet witnessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of the war’s making the world safe for democracy, many of the nations are now ruled by military dictators and the people have no voice in the government. Many of the governments are very harsh and cruel and rule with an oppressive hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably the most benighted and cruel governments are to be found among the little Balkan states. Some of these governments, contrary to the law of God and to the rights of men, have adopted a state religion compelling certain forms of worship. If any citizen who loves God and desires to tell the people of God’s love and kindness toward men makes attempt to teach the same, he is at once arrested and thrown into prison. The cruel prison-keepers beat the prisoners with clubs and otherwise ill-treat and abuse them. The accused is not permitted to-have a trial by a jury of his countrymen, but is haled before a military court and summarily dealt with. He is punished, not for having done any 'wrong or injury to his fellow man, but because he has expressed his desire to enlighten his fellow man and to bring him some help. He is punished because the truth that he would tell interferes with the machinations of the oppressive government under which he must live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people and officials of the more liberal nations are shocked at the cruel and unusual punishment inflicted because of man’s belief and teaching, but they are powerless to render any aid. Each one of these fanatical governments claims the right to punish any one within its</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">borders who dares to differ with the state religion concerning the interpretation of God’s Word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Contemporary with the war and thereafter revolutions broke out which really were expressions by the people of a desire for a better and more liberal government. Moved by a selfish desire, the revolutionists have usually made the condition of the people worse, rather than better. Bolshevism rules some nations and people, which is especially a protest against the government under which they have heretofore lived. All who calmly and soberly view developments well know that bolshevism can never result in a satisfactory government of the people. Bolshevism is doomed to certain and complete failure. The same must be said of communism. Such radical movements for the establishment of a government of the people can never bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the peoples of the nations. Many other nations of the world greatly fear bolshevism, and properly so. Any form of government that denies the rights and privileges of some and shows special favors to others is certain to end in disaster. Monarchies have been harsh, cruel and oppressive of the people, but bolshevism and communism are even worse. No government can bring happiness to the people unless it is founded upon honesty and administered in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is said that the government of the United States of America comes nearest of any on earth to being an ideal government. No honest man understanding the conditions in the United States can claim that it is a satisfactory government. True its founders declared that all men are endowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; but this ideal has never been realized by the people. True also that the founders of that government said that all just powers of government are derived from the consent of the people; but now the consent of the people is neither asked nor obtained. For some years after it was founded there was an attempt to carry into effect the announced principles of government; but never has it succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fundamental laws of the land declare that the people shall have freedom of speech, the right of peaceable assembly, the liberty of conscience without coercion, and the privilege to worship God according to the dictates of each one’s conscience. These rules of action are ideal, but they are denied daily by those who have and exercise the power of government. The officials of the United States government take a solemn oath to safeguard and protect the interests of the people; but such oath is repeatedly violated by the officials, both high and low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The three primary branches of the government of the United States are the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. It is well known that fraud and corruption are rampant in every one of these branches. It is true that there are honest men in all these branches of government doing the best they know how; but the honest ones do not predominate, because the dishonest ones control affairs. A member of the United States senate publicly exclaims:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most important question before the American people is to take the government out of the hands of boodlers, grafters and lobbyists, and place its control in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The public charge goes unchallenged, that a high official in the president's cabinet vigorously enforces the liquor prohibition law against some who are caught; while this same high official himself reaps fabulous sums of money from illegitimate handling of intoxicating liquors. There are two classes who indulge in the violation of the law, to wit, the caught and the uncaught. The weaker ones are caught and examples made of them for show. The stronger and more influential are not caught, because there is no desire that they shall be hindered in their wrongful course. It is manifest that the ways of government officials in this respect are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same president's cabinet another official, whose duty under the law is to ferret out and punish crime, is vigorous and active in the punishment of men who dare exercise their constitutional rights in the freedom of speech, while the same official himself has his hands covered with corruption from bribes received by him that noted criminals might go unpunished. The -ways of the government officials in this regard are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another cabinet official, sworn to protect and safeguard the property interests of the people, enters into a conspiracy with wicked profiteers to wrongfully deprive the people of their property ; and for this he receives large bribes. The ways of this department are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Conscienceless profiteers by fraud acquire fabulous sums of money, a portion of which they use to corrupt the voters and officials to the end that they may continue to carry on their wicked work. These corrupt and wicked men are really the power of government behind the scenes. The power of government therefore is in the hands of a few men whose god is money. They control conscienceless politicians who pose as statesmen, and they are aided and supported in so doing by an organization called the church, and particularly by its clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The government founded as a democracy has been turned into an oligarchy because the supreme power of government is now wielded by these few. The power of these few men has been made doubly strong following the World War. Great corporations called trusts, owned and controlled by a few unscrupulous men, crush out honest commerce, corrupt public officials, and use the so-called organized Christian religion as a screen behind which they carry on their wicked works. The common people suffer, pay the bills, and in vain cry for relief. A member of the United States senate in 1928 in a public address said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Trusts multiply and the president of the United States docs not choose to interfere; monopoly grows fat and the president does not choose to act; combinations are formed and arrogantly pursue their methods under the protection of the government and the president chooses to approve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ways of this government are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To carry on the World War the tax burden of the people was greatly increased. The cost of living was also much increased. Since the war the tax burden has continued and increased, and the cost of living has grown none the less. The reckless administration of the people’s affairs is carried on at great cost and expense with no adequate return to them therefor. A few are favored, while the major portion of the people suffer. In this the ways of the government are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States Patent Office is open to the public. Its records may be inspected by any citizen. Those records disclose that machines have been invented and patented by the use of which the great power produced by the waves of the ocean could be harnessed and made to produce all the heat, light and power the people might require, and that at a very cheap cost. But these machines have been suppressed and not put in use. What would it mean to the people to have such in operation? It would mean that there would be no further need for men to spend their days and nights deep down under the earth digging coal. It would mean that there would be no coal strikes resulting in the starvation of families .while millions of other people suffer for the necessity of fuel. It would mean greater contentment for the people and employment of men on top of the earth tilling the soil that food might be produced cheaper for the people in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It would mean further that the gigantic corporations that manufacture gas and electricity and rob the people for the use thereof would have to go out of business or else furnish the people fuel, light and power at a reasonable price. It -would, mean that the army of men who shovel coal to produce the heat to operate the machines of commerce would find more congenial employment and more peace and happiness in life. It would mean that the women who stand over the cook-stoves -would no longer suffei’ from intense heat while cooking the family meals. The use of these machines to harness the power of the ocean would mean that all the people could have their homes heated and lighted with electricity, and that at a very cheap rate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why are not these machines employed to harness the power to produce these things for man </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font7">Because the great and selfish corporate interests that own and operate the coal fields and the oil wells and the gas factories and the electric light plants have such a tremendous influence and power that they can suppress them; and the people suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is well known that there is a patented device whereby automobiles can be cheaply operated with the use of a very small amount of gasoline, and others whereby they can be operated without gasoline. These inventions have been thrown into the ash-heap because the owners and operators of the great oil companies have succeeded in suppressing them that their own selfish interests-might be furthered. The people suffer as a, result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some time ago there was brought to light an invention by which telegrams can be transmitted over wires very cheaply. The invention permits the transmission of messages over the same wire in opposite directions at the same time and at the rate of approximately a thousand words a minute, To prove that this invention was practical a line of telegraph wires was constructed over a distance of more than one hundred miles and the appliance put in operation. It was exceedingly satisfactory. The invention, however, if employed, would revolutionize the cost of telegraphy; and the great corporations that now control this method of transmission would be deprived of some of their ill-got gains. They had the power and influence to suppress the use and operation of this invention. And the people suffer as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The government issues a patent to the inventor for these inventions and then stands by and sees a few selfish men deprive the people of the benefits therefrom. In this the ways of the government are not equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A member of the president’s cabinet accepts a bribe to commit a wrongful act. The bribe-giver attempts to wrongfully influence a jury to bring about an acquittal of the wrong-doer. Referring to this on February 26,1928, a well-known writer in the public press, Arthur Brisbane, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A certain rich man, accused of bribing a cabinet officer, is convicted of tampering with a jury and sentenced to six months in jail. The average citizen reads the news and says: “Nonsense, they’ll never put HIM in jail.” Next day’s newspaper announces that the prosperous gentleman plans a trip to Europe, assured by good lawyers that he need not worry about the jail for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> year, if ever. Had he been poor and convicted of stealing an overcoat, he would be in jail now, and stay more than six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The natural resources of the United States of America make it the richest country under the sun. Its broad and fertile fields produce food sufficient to feed the peoples of earth. Much of the soil. however, is idle and not tilled. In February, 1928, a resolution was introduced in the United States house of representatives, looking to the relief of the unemployed. At that time it was reported that four million persons in the United States were without employment. There is sufficient land to employ every one of them, if conditions were made half-way favorable to compensate them for labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The selfish, cruel profiteers make it impossible for many to till the soil and even make a living. These great trusts loan money upon the land at a usurious rate. They manipulate the price of the marketable products so that the producer is unable to market his crops at any reasonable price, and is therefore unable to pay the interest on his mortgage, and he loses the land. He becomes 'discouraged and seeks some other way of making a living. The corporations get the land, and then those who till it become serfs and not owners. The government does not aid the producer. In this the ways of the government are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A. few honest men in Congress attempt to pass a law providing for the irrigation and reclamation of other lands. The opening of such lands to occupancy and cultivation would make it possible for an army of men to engage in farming. Big Business with its ill-got gains controls the legislative body and has power to prevent the enactment of the irrigation and reclamation scheme; and the people suffer as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every four years in the United States the people are called upon to select a president. There are two major political parties that put candidates in the field. Both of these parties are controlled by the favored and selfish interests. Candidates for both parties are named by Big Business, often secretly behind closed doors, and the convention of the people is manipulated thereafter to cause their election. The voters go to the poles and vote, but Big Business wins regardless of who is elected. Then the government is carried on by and in the interest of a few and against the interest of the majority. It is anything but a democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are some of the unsatisfactory conditions that exist in the United States of America. There are many more and worse conditions existing. It may be conceded, as claimed, that the United States is the best government on earth. If that is true and it is so unsatisfactory, what can be said for the governments that are less favorable to the interests of the people ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without a doubt the British is the strongest government on earth. Among its ruling class there are able men, but these men are imperfect and are influenced and moved like other men. The government is not satisfactory to the British at home. The government is less satisfactory to the people of many of the colonies that go to make up the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">India is a land ruled by the British government. It is a vast country of 1,800,000 square miles, with a population of upward of 300,000,000 people. India has never had a satisfactory government. Its people have never been united. The caste system that exists in that land has</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">always produced a wide breach between the rulers and the ruled. Some of the upper caste have started movements for self-government and to be freed from the British empire. This is one of the problems with which the British government has to deal. The British have not established a satisfactory government in India, and never can. If the British should withdraw and commit all the powers of government to the Indians themselves, the upper caste would grind and oppress the lower strata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At home the British government has had a great army of unemployed since the war. Many have been the strikes and other expressions of discontent against the government. It can not be said that either the home or the foreign parts of the government are satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peoples of the world are familiar with the conditions existing to some extent at least in their respective governments. Let the entire list be canvassed, from the least to the greatest, and not one government under the sun will be found that is ideal and satisfactory even to the majority of the people under that government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These things are not here said for the purpose of producing discontent; but it is merely a statement of the plain facts that thoughtful men might consider what is the cause and what, if any, is the remedy. If we would deal honestly with ourselves and with our fellow man we should want to acquaint ourselves with the real facts and dispassionately consider what may be done for the betterment of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Disarmament</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The World War wrought such terrible havoc that the people were anxious to adopt a method that would prevent another great war. Men upon whom the responsibility rested to do something concluded that a league or compact of the principal nations of the- world would accomplish the desired result. The league was formed. Many nations entered into that compact, while others declined to enter it; and an effort has been put forth to establish such a relationship between the nations that all controversies may be settled without war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The League of Nations has not bettered the world. It can not better the governments and it can not prevent war. It has never succeeded in establishing ideal conditions among the people on earth, and can not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Acting in accord with the announced purpose of the League of Nations, conferences have been held looking to the disarmament of the various nations and countries, thus to make war impossible. The United States did not openly enter the League of Nations, but did in conference agree to the destruction of some of its battleships to the value of $500,000,000, which had been paid for by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now (October, 1928) after the League has been in existence for nearly a decade, the United States congress has before it a program to expend $750,000,000 to construct a more powerful navy than it has ever before had. It is also spending millions of dollars in the construction of fleets of airplanes that can engage in a warfare of destruction from the air. The disarmament movement has practically collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other nations, both of Europe and of the Orient, are constantly increasing the power of their armies, navies and air fleets. Years after the World War ceased, and after the formation of the League of Nations, the various nations remain armed, despite the haranguing by the politicians. Big Business will not permit disarmament. A leading magazine writer, discussing the Geneva Conference looking to disarmament and prevention of war, well says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In theory all the delegates were gathered together to carry out the will of their people. But in fact they could do nothing because the big bosses, for their own reasons, as a result of their own bargains, were agreed that nothing should be done. The hope of Europe for disarmament was denied because the protocol was contrary to the material interests of one great power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preparation for another great war continues, and the people suffer under the burden. The continued preparation for war is a certain indication that the nations expect to indulge in more war. The man who carries a gun is certain to use it upon what he considers a sufficient provocation. Nations are composed of men, all of like passions; and when governments are controlled by selfish and ambitious men and these men arm the governments, the arms are put in use whenever the selfish interests think that it is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The facts show that long after the formation of the League of Nations and the disarmament conferences have been held these conferences have become abortive and the preparation for war goes on. The rulers of the world are in perplexity and in fear of what the future will bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some sincere men in public life who would like to see the people in a better condition are at their wits’ end as to what can be done. Expressions by some of these, quoted below, are concurred in by millions of thoughtful persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are living in a kind of fool’s paradise. Under the slogan of preparedness the militarists everywhere are again precipitating a deluge of war.-F. B. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Smith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Airplanes, poison gas and hatred mixed together are spelling the doom of civilization. America is preparing for war on a scale so colossal that it has no parallel in the history of the world. Our civilization will perish unless we strive for international peace. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">-—Frederick</span><span class="font5"> J. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Libby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next war will last but a few days. With the air and gas attacks which have been planned by headquarters’ staffs, London and Paris will be wiped out in a night.—W. L. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Warden</span><span class="font5"> of the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I think it is certain that if there be another such war civilization will never recover from it.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Viscount Grey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am afraid that unless something intervenes there may be in the world again a catastrophe, but not like the last one. The next war may well destroy civilization unless something or somebody does something.— </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lloyd George.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Need of Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon the earth there are divers and numerous nations, small and great. AU the people of all these nations are made of one blood. The rights of all should be equal. The privileges enjoyed by the people are unequal in each and every government of earth. If there were a world democracy, and men were perfect, the world would be safe for democracy, and then the privileges of all peoples would be equal. It is well known that they are unequal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why should the people of Germany fight against the people of America? Or the English fight against the French? And why should people of one nation engage in a deadly conflict against the people of another nation? Is there any just cause or excuse for so doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The respective governments of these various nations establish an imaginary line or boundary and endeavor to keep the people of each nation within such boundary. If one journeys from one country to another, he must obtain the consent of the government under which he lives and the approval of the government to which he goes. The government controls the people, and not the people the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font7"> a dispute arises between the governing powers or nations, the people or subjects are called upon to bear arms against their fellow men or the other government. Patriotism is invoked to induce the people to fight against each other. Patriotism is wrongfully invoked. Patriotism means love of country and love for the people of that country. Love means an unselfish desire to do good and an effort to put that desire into action. True patriotism therefore should lead the people to endeavor to help each other; and if true patriotism were invoked, there would be no deadly wars between peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The peoples being all made of one blood and made to dwell upon the earth, if all were moved by true patriotism they would be unselfishly trying to help one another instead of trying to kill one another. It is the demagogue who waves his arms and appeals to the people to show their patriotism by going to war and slaying each other. As a rule those who make the most noise about patriotism never go to war themselves but slink behind to profit by the spoils at home. When the boys who bear the brunt of the battle return scarred and maimed for life, the profiteers and patriotism-howlers forget these faithful citizens, furnish them with no relief but permit them to drag out a miserable existence during the remainder of their days. True patriotism should at least provide aid, comfort and support for those who have been incapacitated by reason of the performance of service which they have been compelled to perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every thoughtful person sees that after thousands of years of effort on the part of men to establish ideal governments civilization is now about to collapse. Such is the expressed view of the leading statesmen of the world. The peoples of earth have reached a point of dire extremity. That extremity seems to be necessary to cause the people to carefully and earnestly consider the reason for the unsatisfactory conditions and to seek a true remedy. The present condition of civilization compels all thoughtful persons to agree that there is a great need for a stable and just government of the peoples of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A just government is one that is founded in honesty and unselfishly administered in righteousness. The ways of such governments must be equal toward all. All honest persons must agree that such a government is of paramount necessity if the peoples of earth are to enjoy peace, prosperity, life, liberty and happiness. In such a government the supreme governing power must center in and be exercised by one who is honest, just and kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the peoples of earth are to receive and enjoy the greatest possible benefits from their government, their minds must find just cause to readily assent to the honesty and righteousness of the governing power exercised over them. When the people see that the governor is righteous and true and is ruling in righteousness, then the inhabitants will learn to do right and to dwell together in peace. It must be conceded by all that the governors of this world have not been satisfactory to man in the past and are not satisfactory at the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purpose of this series of lectures is to prove from indisputable evidence that the supreme governing power exercised over the nations of the world in the past six thousand years has been unrighteous; that the time has come for a great change; and that the beginning of that time of change is marked by the year 1914; that hereafter the governing power over the peoples of earth shall be exercised by One in whom resides supremacy; and that that governing power shall be exercised in righteousness for the benefit of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some will say this statement is fantastic because what is and has been will ever continue to be. To such the answer is: Up to this time man has failed to establish a righteous government on earth; the governments of the world are now sick unto death; there must be a reason for such condition, and man should attempt to ascertain that reason. It will therefore be worth your while to examine the evidence and then determine whether or not there is hope for a better government for mankind and an early realization of that hope. If there is reason for such hope, then every honest person should desire to know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The necessity for an honest and righteous government must be conceded by all. There is a certainty of a righteous government’s being established on earth, and it is to the interest of each one to calmly and dispassionately examine the evidence bearing thereupon, for his own benefit and for the benefit of his fellow creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Next Sunday we will have under consideration the supreme power from which emanates the righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'The Children’s Own Radio Story </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By C. J. W., 'Jr. </span><span class="font7">Story Twenty-eight</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">E REMEMBER that when Jesus sat at table with the publicans and sinners, the Pharisees, or “good people” of the time, made believe that they were shocked that the Master would do such a thing’. He reproved them for their false pride, and showed that the real sinners were they themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Jesus went to Jerusalem, to attend a feast of the Jews. While there He went to look at a famous pool, called the Pool of Bethesda. There was a legend among the people concerning this pool, that at certain seasons an angel went down into it and stirred up the water, and that whoever went down first into the water after it had been stirred would be made well of any disease he might have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now we know from our previous study of the ways of God that He does not permit angels to -fly around loose, stirring up pools of water in which to perform miracles. The fact is, then, that the Pool of Bethesda was a mineral spring, like the hot springs of Colorado, and of course it was beneficial to all who bathed in or drank the waters. The account of the angel descending into the water is not found in the very oldest manuscripts of the Bible, so we may be certain that that part of the story can be laid to the pen of some copier whose mind was running upon fairy tales instead of the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus saw numbers of sick folk gathered near the pool, waiting for the stirring of the water. (You know, some mineral and hot springs are agitated at times.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There was one man in particular whose appearance attracted the Savior, an elderly man with a quiet, patient manner, who could not walk, but had to lie upon a bed most of the time. This man had been very sick for thirty-eight years, and was too weak and ill even to crawl to the edge of the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus, with the spirit of God upon Him, knew all about this man, how long he had been sick, how he had suffered, and what a sweet and patient disposition he had kept throughout. So the Master leaned compassionately over the poor figure on the mattress, and said. “Wilt thou be made whole?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. And the man answered Him, “Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another step-peth down before me,&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Jesus said, &quot;Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.” And the man who had lain upon a mattress for thirty-eight years arose, folded up his bed, threw it across his shoulder, and walked away rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the day upon which this miracle occurred was the sabbath, and many Jews were disturbed at the sight of the man carrying his bed, and said to him, “It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The man answered and said, “He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.” And they asked him, “What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the man could not tell them who it was, for Jesus had left that place immediately after healing the man. But, a little later, Jesus came upon the man in the temple of God at Jerusalem, and said unto him, “Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the man went out of the temple, and told the people it was Jesus who had healed him. And the Jews sought to kill Jesus, because He had done these things upon the sabbath day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do you know that exactly similar events are taking place around us right now? Notice: Jesus healed a man who had been sick in bed for nearly forty years, and forgave him his sins besides, and because this was done upon the' sabbath day, the people wanted to kill Him. The Bible Students present the Truth about God and His Word to the people, and because they do it every clay in the week, including Sunday, the preachers or “Pharisees” of these times want them arrested and shot and persecuted in every kind of way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only difference between a Pharisee of Jesus’ day and a “Pharisee” of today is one of clothes. The hearts of both are equally wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then Jesus arose and told the people much that was good for them to know and would have been well for them to heed. But they were a proud and hard-hearted lot, and scorned the words of the Master. Seeing this, He reproved them, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.... And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom lie hath sent, him ye believe not.</span></p><img src="g_E_19290501_files/g_E_19290501-9.png" alt="" style="width:547pt;height:730pt;">
