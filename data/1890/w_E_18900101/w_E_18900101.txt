REMOVAL TO BETTER QUARTERS. 

The increase of the work makes necessary 
a removal of our office to more commodious 
and better lighted quarters at the 
address given above. We praise the Lord 
for the increased opportunities for usefulness 
in his service, which this change 
seems to imply. Unite with us in rendering 
thanks, and in the prayer that from 
the new building 

"The light— the radiance from the cross, 
The depth of love revealing," 
may shine more and more until perfect 
day; and that 

"Still new beauties we may see 
And still increasing light."

NO TOWER FOR DECEMBER, 1889. 

In view of our removal, and in view 
also of our need of our type in preparing 
MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. III., we concluded 
to omit a TOWER issue for December 
15th and to send this January issue a 
little earlier than the middle of the month, 
so as not to keep our readers too long in 
suspense. Instead of the December TOWER 
we sent to all readers samples of the 



"OLD THEOLOGY"-a tract-pamphlet issued 

quarterly at the small sum of 5 cents 

per year. Subscriptions for Old Theology 

may be sent in with your TOWER subscriptions. 

See terms for quantities, etc., on 

second page of sample tract No. 4. In ordering 

please state whether you wish your 

subscription to date back to the beginning, 

or to start with January 1890. 



R1171 :page 1 

YOU CAN ASSIST IN THIS. 



We want to know, at once, how many 
postoffice boxes there are in every postoffice 
in the United States and Canada. 
How many are there in your post office? 
With what number do they begin and 
with what number do they stop? Also, 
if possible, we would like to know how 
many are vacant and for rent, and what 
their numbers are. How many of our 
readers will serve us and the cause to this 
extent? It will cost you only a postal 
card and a little time. Or, if you are 
sending in your subscription for the TOWER, 
you can enclose the memoranda on 
a separate slip of paper. 

Each one who thus serves (if not already 
on the list) will be entered as a subscriber 
for Old Theology Tracts for 1 890 
FREE.

GREETINGS FOR THE NEW YEAR. 

Beloved readers, it is with hearts full of 
thankfulness that we acknowledge the divine 
favors of the year just closed. The 
Twenty-Third Psalm voices our sentiments. 
The Lord has graciously continued 
his gentle leading of his sheep beside still 
waters and into the fresh green pastures 
of his truth. Our table he has supplied 
with viands of grace and knowledge, 
bountifully, even in the presence of our 
enemies, who sometimes have been those 
near and dear to us— enemies to the truth 
because of the blinding of the great adversary, 
Satan. And we know from your 



precious letters received during the year 
that this, our experience, has been yours. 

Now, in the dawn of a new year, we 
feel that we can apply to ourselves and to 
all God's consecrated ones the words of 
the last verse of this Psalm : "Surely goodness 
and mercy shall attend me all the 
days of my life; and I shall dwell forever 
in the house of the Lord." Let us, beloved, 
not only appreciate the bounties 
of our "table," but more and more feed 
upon the precious truth; and let us seek 
more and more to make use of the strength 
this food imparts, laboring in Christ's service, 
that we may become more and more 
"strong in the Lord and in the power of 
his might." 



R1171 :page 1 

CONSIDER THIS CAREFULLY. 



One of the most important questions 
with some who will receive this number 
of the TOWER is, whether or not they will 
receive the succeeding issues. To many 
it may be said to be the only channel of 
communication between them and the remainder 
of the household of faith; to very 
many it is the only channel through which 
the voice of the Chief Shepherd is heard. 
And yet, because not urged to subscribe, 
or because they neglect or put off attending 
to the matter, many every year are 
dropped from our lists; and often, may 
be a year or two after, write us that they 
are lean of soul and starved for lack of 
the food it bears from the Master to his 
friends and household each month. We 
are most firmly convinced that the TOWER 
is and has been a chosen vessel in the 
Lord's hands for dispensing "meat in due 
season," and we pray and labor that it 
may so continue to be used. For these 
reasons, and 

FOR THE FIRST TIME, 

we urge all to renew their subscriptions. 
We need scarcely tell you that we do not 
urge for the money's sake. Most of you 
know that such a paper as ours at 50 cents 
per year, without income from advertisements, 
could not pay its way and pay for 



editorial and office labor, postage, etc. But 
we never have accepted and hope never to 
need to accept money for our services; 
they are grateful, loving offerings to the 
Lord, and to his church which represents 
him. ( Col. 1:24 .) The truth already 
has done so much for us that we are paid, 
exceeding abundantly, more than we could 
ask or expect, in advance, for all the service 
we are able to render. And besides, 

R1172 :page 1 

we are as greatly blessed each month as 
any of you, as the message flows from our 
pen to you, and as from your letters we 
learn of the rich blessings that the water of 
life and love, the truth, brings to your 
hearts continually. Indeed, so greatly 
are our hearts blessed by the preparing of 
the food for the household that we should 
be greatly disappointed were the privilege 
of the service, or even the privilege of 
doing it gratis, taken from us to be given 
to some one more worthy the great honor 
and privilege of being a "servant of all." 

We explain the matter thus, fully, that 
you may rightly appreciate our motives 
in asking you to attend to the matter at 
once if you have any interest in the truths 
which the TOWER presents, that your interest 
may, by the watering of the Lord 
through our "broken vessel," increase 
greatly, to his praise and your profit and 
to our joy in you, through the Redeemer. 

Our desire would be that the WATCH 
TOWER subscription lists should contain 

THE NAMES OF ALL INTERESTED 
IN PRESENT TRUTH. 

We desire this for their good, and for 
their present and everlasting joy, and not 
from any selfish motive; and to bring 
about this desired result we have arranged 

1 st. The very low price of the paper— 
50 cents per year,— less than one cent a 
week and less than one-seventh of a cent 
per day; so that but slight sacrifice, if 
any, will be required to be made to obtain 
it by any who have any money whatever 
at their command. 

2nd. We have provided that the cloth-bound 
one dollar edition of DAWN may 
be had by subscribers at half price; or, 
to reverse this proposition, We will give 



the TOWER one year gratis to any who 
purchase the cloth DAWN at one dollar. 
And to introduce the TOWER we shall 
probably sell future volumes of DAWN 
only upon these terms. 

3d. We have provided— See Terms on 
first column— that any and all of God's 
children who by reason of age, or sickness, 
or accident, or by reason of inability 
to get employment, or who for any 
other reason are unable to pay the cost of 
the paper, may have it free, if they will 
write at the beginning of each year and 
state their desire for the paper, but their 
present inability to pay its cost— a postal 
card will do. But the card or letter must 
be from the person desiring the TOWER 
on these terms. 

We want to hear from every one of you 
at least once a year. It does you good to 
write to us, and it does us good to hear 
from you and to judge of your growth in 
grace, knowledge and love of the Truth. 
But you must not expect us to answer personally 
all your good letters. Accept, 
please, of the articles of the monthly 
TOWERS as our letters to you, and let your 
letters be your answers back to us— at least 
one letter each year, to let us know that 
our preaching is not in vain in your case. 

But let none suppose that all need to 
be urged to write us of their joy and love 
and growth, or to renew their subscriptions. 
Ah! no, thank God! Had it been 
so we, doubtless, should have become discouraged 
long ago. We receive every 
year thousands of letters which we prize 
more, far, than money or worldly honors; 
and more than any thing else except the 
blessings of the Master himself. Some 
of these from time to time we insert in 
the TOWER for your general joy, but some 
of the most precious are laid away carefully 
at home as precious mementos. 

Beloved, let us hear from you— at once! 



R1172 :page 1 

OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS, ETC. 

We have not the time to give you the 
particulars of this branch of the work, or 
of the Tract Fund work, as we should like 
to do at the beginning of the new year. 



We have no high-salaried officers whose 
sole work it is to keep accounts and make 
reports. We, on the contrary, are going 
ahead doing with our might (with the resources 
at our command) what our hands 
find to do, (and that is a large work, we 
assure you, and we cannot nearly do it 
all,) and we leave to the Lord the bookkeeping, 
accounting and full reporting. 
Our Accountant is an all-wise and infallible 
one. He sees and notes the efforts 
made by every one of you in his service— 
the service of the truth. By and by- 
it will not be very long— he shall render 
his account of our several stewardships, 
when he shall render to every man according 
as his work shall be; for every man's 
works show his faith and his love, according 
to his ability. And where there is a 
will to serve the Lord, there is always 
some way of showing it. 

R1172 : page 2 

Briefly, we may say that while we have 
been somewhat disappointed that so many 
readers have failed to appreciate and use 
the Old Theology Quarterly as a method 
of service, yet a few others have more 
than made up for this, and have quite exceeded 
our hopes in their zeal and service 
—some subscribing for and using as many 
as three thousand copies of the tracts each 
quarter. A hasty examination shows that 
(stating it in the usual manner of stating 
tract circulation,) over five millions of 
pages of Old Theology Tracts went out 
of our office into general circulation during 
the past year. And from present indications 
we would not be surprised if the 
year 1890 would more than double the 
output of 1889, large as that has been. 



R1172 : page 2 

WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME FROM? 

This we know is a question often asked 
among our friends and enemies. Our 
terms on DAWNS, tracts, etc., to our readers 
and to colporteurs, made very public, 
convince all that we are not selling the 
truth for gain; and as the work keeps on 
and on, the wonder increases. Strangers 



surmise that many wealthy folks are interested 
in the work; but those intimately 
acquainted know better, that the Apostle's 
prediction is fully verified,— that 
among the interested are not many rich, 
not many great, not many whom the 
world esteems wise, but chiefly the poor 
of this world.— See 1 Cor. 1:26-29 and 
James 2:5 . 

We can only answer: The work is the 
Lord's and the workers are his, wherever 
they may be laboring in the harvest field. 
He is caring for and providing for his own 
work. As for ourselves, we do not live 
out of the work, nor accept any monetary 
compensation for our service for the Master 
and his cause, that our time and effort 
may be an offering of sweet savor unto 
the Lord, acceptable to him through 
Christ Jesus, our Redeemer. We mention 
this, not as a reproof to any whom God 
has differently situated, but that the friends 
may know how this part of the Lord's 
harvest work is conducted. 

While our personal accounts and affairs 
are kept separate from those of the general 
work— "The Tract Fund"— yet we thank 
God that we have nothing of our own; 
that we left all to follow him; that having 
given ourselves entirely to him, we were 
enabled to realize that, if we are wholly 
his, all that we have and are is his also. 
Hence, though our personal accounts are 
kept separate and distinct from the general 
Tract Fund account, yet both are governed 
and used under the same general principles, 
of which care and economy are parts, 
coupled, we trust, with heaven-directed 
judgment as to how best and most to reach 
and bless and set free the true sheep, by 
so dispensing the harvest message as to 
lead them out of error's bondage and 
sectarian slavery into the liberty of the 
truth, and to let all who have an ear hear 
the voice of the great Shepherd. 

Some have said to us (and many have 
written the same in substance): "If you 
ever get short and need a little help, be 
sure to call on me, and I shall be glad to 
assist." We thank all such, and realize 
their good intentions and appreciate them, 
but we never have asked and never will ask 
money for the Lord's cause. The nearest 
we ever came to asking money from 
any convinced us that such a course is 
wholly contrary to the Lord's will. That 



instance was in 1881, when over a million 
copies of "Food for Thinking Christians" 
were published and circulated. We then 
remembered a Brother, who was well-to-do, 
and who had repeatedly shown a deep 
interest in the cause, and who had said to 

us, "Brother R , whenever you see 

something good, something specially calculated 

to spread the light and needing 

money, something in which you intend to 

invest, let me know of it— count me in 

on all such enterprises;" and we merely 

laid the matter before him, explaining the 

plan and the amount of money that could 

be used, without making any direct request. 

The Brother gave liberally, yet 

apparently the offering brought him only 

a partial blessing. And, perhaps from 

fear that we would call further opportunities 

to his notice, and from a lack of 

full appreciation of our motives in the 

matter or of the light in which we regarded 

it (as a favor toward him to let him 

know of the opportunity), that Brother 

has gone backward and lost much of his 

former interest. How much the above 

circumstance had to do with his decline 

of interest we know not, but it doubly 

strengthened and guarded us on a point 

R1173 : page 2 

on which we were already well settled, 
namely, that no direct and personal appeals 
should be made to any in our Lord's 
name. All the gold and silver is his. 
He neither begged nor commissioned any 
to beg for him. 

As he increases the supply of the means, 
we will sow the seed of truth the more 
bountifully and liberally, and yet economically 
and judiciously as we know how; 
and if he withholds the funds, we will 
still be thankful and seek to make what is 
supplied go as far as possible, by practicing 
the more rigid economy; and if the 
supplies stop entirely, instead of asking 
man or even asking the Lord for more, 
we shall be content to stop the work entirely, 
believing that such a course would 
thus be indicated to be the Lord's will. 

Ah! it is a great mistake, dear friends, 
to hold on to a money-talent, or any other 
talent of which we may be possessed, and 
to say, When I see that my talents are 
needed, when I see that the Lord's work 



has been crippled and interrupted for lack 
of what I have,— then I will give and give 
liberally, if need be to the last dollar 
or the last breath. Such a love of the 
Lord, though far better than many have, 
is not of the sort our Master will accept 
and honor as worthy to be of his Bride. 
Such a spirit analyzed means, I am selfish, 
I love my plans and schemes in which I 
find use for every dollar. I do not appreciate 
the privilege of self-denial, but 
if God should speak from heaven and demand 
all, I would promptly give all, or 
if I found God's plan likely to fail utterly 
for the lack of what I could give, if it 
took the last dollar, I would rescue the 
Lord and his cause from failure. 

The proper course is, to realize that 
God is abundantly able to carry out all 
his plans without our aid at all; and that 
instead of our gifts of time and energy 
and money being necessary to help God 
along, he is favoring us amazingly, by 
granting us the privilege of co-working 
with him in using what little we may have. 
This is a privilege which all may enjoy. 
The poor widow and the poor laborer of 
ever so small income, as well as the more 
highly favored in this world's goods, 
should appreciate the privilege of bringing 
some present to the Lord— something 
that will testify their love, and show what 
is in their hearts to do, were they possessed 
of larger talents and opportunities. 
The two mites or two cents of the poor 
widow may cost as great self-denial as ten 
dollars would cost a mechanic or merchant, 
or as a thousand dollars would 
cost a wealthy man, or as a hundred thousand 
dollars would cost a millionaire. 
One may deny himself a yacht or a new 
residence, another may deny himself an 
extra carriage, or a trip to Europe, another 
may deny himself an extra suit of 
clothes or a usual "summer outing," and 
the widow may deny herself an extra table 
relish. It is self-denial in either case, 
and when done for the cause of our Redeemer, 
it is appreciated by him, not according 
to the amount but according to 
the self-denial, which gauges the love as 
truly in one case as in the other. 

Could each one fully realize his present 
privileges, the conduct of each would 
declare— 
"All for Jesus, all for Jesus, 



All my being's ransomed powers, 

All my thoughts and words and doings, 
All my days, and all my hours." 

The consecrated condition voiced by 
the Apostle is, "For me to live is Christ:" 
and wherever that sentiment is even partially 
shared by God's people to-day, 
there is such a desire to tell of his mighty 
love, that time, talent, voice, purse and 
every other thing are valued specially because 
they enable the adorer to show forth 
the glories of the Adored One who hath 
called us out of darkness into his marvelous 
light. 

To such, the one-tenth of all increase, 
which the Law commanded the Jew to 
consecrate, and which some Christians 
observe, would seem an offering far too 
small to satisfy the demands of their love-inspired 
zeal. Such must and will do 
more— not of constraint or command, 
but to testify to the Redeemer their love 
and devotion. These will take pleasure 
in cutting short the time previously spent 
in the reading of light literature and daily 
news; they will be less careful and less 
energetic in pushing business so as to lay 
up treasure on earth for their children or 
others to quarrel over and be injured by; 
they will spend less time in foolishly endeavoring 
to shine on earth by "putting 
on style," in dress and home and road 
equipage. And they will not only thus 
save moments and hours, and dimes and 
dollars; but they will use them also, which 
some forget to do who are adepts at saving. 

How shall we spend our savings of time 
and money? becomes an important question. 
We answer, if you and all that you 
have are the Lord's, you are God's steward 
in this matter, and must consult his 
will and not your own nor another's will. 
In other words, you must act up to your 
own conscience and light in this matter, 
no matter who or how many offer you advice. 
You will be advised and urged to 
give time, influence and money to support 
great Babylon in some or in many 
forms— as to assist in employing a worldly, 
unbelieving choir to displease God by 
praising and chanting with their lips while 
their hearts are far from him. ("Unto 
the wicked God saith, What hast thou to 
do to declare my statutes, or that thou 
shouldst take my covenant in thy mouth? 
seeing that thou hatest instruction and 



casteth my words behind thee."— Psalm 50:16,17 .) 

Or perhaps you will be 

asked to contribute toward the support of 

a minister who, either ignorantly or stupidly 

or for money, devotes his time to 

misrepresenting the character and plan of 

our God, and thus blinding the very eyes 

that he should be opening with the eyesalve 

of truth. Or perhaps you will be urged 

to give money to assist the Foreign Missions 

in carrying the bad tidings abroad, 

or to help Home Missions to teach the 

Indians of the West and the Negroes of 

the South, directly or indirectly, the very 

errors from which, thank God, you have 

gotten free through the truth— to help 

put upon others the chains of error from 

which you have just gained freedom. 

Can you spend either time or money in 
those channels, conscientiously believing 
that thus spent it will most glorify God? 
If you have come to a knowledge of the 
truth, you certainly can do nothing of the 
sort. Better far to waste the time, and 
waste or destroy the money, than to use it 
thus to fetter others with error and to dishonor 
our God. 

If your giving and sacrificing are from 
the right motives, you will need to be just 
as conscientious as to how you spend your 
time, influence and means for God and 
truth, as you are to economize and save 
these from self and worldly things. The 
world and the devil are continually begging. 
Beware of those who beg in Christ's 
name. Be suspicious of them. Scrutinize 
their objects closely. God never begs. 
The most he ever asks you for is your 
heart— "My son, give me thy heart." 
When our hearts are fully his, we begin to 
urge him more and more to accept our little 
offerings. And as we become anxious to 
serve him and intelligently seek how we 
may best do so, he graciously gives us the 
privilege by letting us see where and 
how we may co-work with him in the 
spread of present truth.

THE NEW YEAR. 

"Gone with our yesterdays; folded apart, 
Laid by with the treasures we hide in the heart, 



The year that hath left us, so silently shod, 
Has carried its records of earth unto God. 
How strange was its mingling of bitter and sweet, 
Its trials how heavy, its pleasures how fleet; 
How often its mercies surprised us, unsought; 
How frequent the gifts to our hands, which it 

brought; 
Alas! that we shadowed its glory with sin, 
Nor battled its beautiful trophies to win; 
And thanks unto Him, who gave pardon and rest, 
And wrought for His children whatever was best. 

"Cometh in winter the year that is new. 
Snow-fall, and frost-rime, and star-beam, and dew, 
Shine of the daisies, and blush of the clover, 
Rose cup and lily for bees to hang over, 
Stir of the wind in the waves of the wheat, 
Smile of the violet low at our feet, 
Fruitage of orchard, and cluster of vine, 
Seed-time and harvest, O man! will be thine, 
Once more in this year; for what hath been, 

shall be, 
While the rivers of time seek eternity's sea. 

"So, a Happy New Year, to the babe and the 

mother, 
To gentle wee sister, and rosy cheeked brother. 
A Happy New Year to the aged, who wait 
Till the Lord opens wide the Paradise gate. 
A Happy New Year unto those who have learned 
How rich are the guerdons which labor has earned. 
And a Happy New Year to the weary, who cling 
Through sorrow and pain, to the cross of the 

King. 

"Far down thy fair vista, blithe New Year, we see 
The sun gleam of the beautiful Sabbath to be; 
From far o'er the billows we hear the glad swells 
Amid people in darkness, of church-going bells. 
God speed the full time when idols shall fall, 
And the banner of Jesus wave white over all; 
When the nations shall walk in the light of the 

Lord, 
And Eden's lost verdure to earth be restored. 

"Dear Christ, by Thy passion, Thy grace and Thy 
power, 
Assist us, uplift us, in each clouded hour, 
And still by denial, bestowal, delay, 
Whatever is needful, oh, give us, we pray! 
The year that is far above rubies shall be 
The year of our lives that is closest to Thee. 
And precious and sacred our changes shall grow, 
If heaven-light o'er them in tenderness glow. 
Let the burdens of woe, and the conflicts of care, 
Alike be relieved by the breathings of prayer; 



And happy, or only resigned, let us raise 
Each morning and evening the songs of our 
praise." — Selected. 



R1174 : page 3 

THE NEW COVENANT. 

IT IS FOR GOD'S FRIENDS. 



God's law is that righteous arrangement 
which God's unerring wisdom has established 
for regulating the affairs of his 
creatures for their good and his pleasure. 
God's will is his law, which is as unchangeable 
as he is all-wise and unchangeable. 
God's law is, therefore, the only 
covenant or agreement he ever makes with 
his creatures. When man was created 
and placed under favorable conditions in 
Eden, OBEDIENCE (fullest acquiescence 
with the perfect will of his Creator) was 
made the condition of his continued enjoyment 
of life and all its attendant favors 
and blessings. This was not a covenant 
but a condition, because a covenant 
signifies a contract or agreement between 
two parties, and we know that Adam 
could not have been consulted about his 
own creation or asked to agree to any 
covenant regarding the continuance of 
his existence. While it would have been 
neither kind nor just to have so created 
Adam that life would have been an injury 
and a burden, or to have brought him 
into conditions wherein an eternity of 
misery might have been risked, it was 
both kind and just for God to do what he 
did do, viz., to create him perfect in the 
midst of Eden's perfections and to give 
him the privilege of perpetual life and 
blessing under his Creator's favor upon 
condition of his full and hearty obedience 
to his benefactor's wise, just, loving and 
necessary laws, plans and regulations. 
Otherwise his communion and fellowship 
with God, his pleasures in Eden and even 
life itself, were to be withdrawn from him, 
as one unworthy of them. And his as yet 
unborn race, in his loins and represented 
by him, were involved in that penalty 
with him, when he knowingly and willingly 
violated the condition of life. 

Since God and his law and regulations, 



which represent his character, are unchangeable, 

a careful scrutiny and study 

of this first transaction between God and 

man reveals clearly the fact that as God 

did not prepare Eden and its favors for 

his enemies, nor even for one who without 

enmity would refuse or neglect to 

comply with his perfect, righteous laws, 

so he need not be expected, either, to 
prepare the earth as the Paradise of God 
and to redeem and restore and grant everlasting 
life to any who, when fully informed, 
would have a disposition to oppose 
him or to infract or evade the least 
of his wise, benevolent and just laws and 
regulations. In a word, whatever favors 
God ever has, or shall extend are for his 
loyal friends; and none of them are for 
his enemies. 

But, while thus clearly noting that the 
enemies of God are the enemies of his 
righteous laws and regulations and the 
friends of God are those who do whatsoever 
he commands ( John 15:14 ); and 
while noticing also that his desire toward 
his friends is that they may have everlasting 
life in the enjoyment of his fellowship 
and favor, and his determination and decree 
toward his enemies is that they shall 
be cut off from life and from all his favors 
as mere cumberers of the ground; let us 
not make the too common mistake of supposing 
that the friends of righteousness- 
friends of God— can all be easily recognized 
now. By no means; under the 
present reign of Sin and evil the service 
of Sin brings at least a transient reward 
of pleasure or gratification, while the 
service of Truth and Righteousness brings 
at least a transient pain or reproach. 
Doubtless many now serve Sin because 
of its present gratification of inherited 
weaknesses, who really detest it and would 
rejoice in righteousness, if they were as 
favorably circumstanced as Adam was. 
Such, therefore, are not really the enemies 
of righteousness and of God. 

Many now stand with the open wilful 
enemies of righteousness and sit in the 
seat of the scornful, because of ignorance 
of God's plan and character; because 
blinded by Satan ( 2 Cor. 4:4 ; Psa. 1:1 ); 

R1175 : page 3 

and because their ideas of right and wrong 



are badly warped and twisted, through 

various false doctrines and theories. We 

might not always be able to tell which of 

our fellow-men are friends of righteousness 

and unwilling sinners, and which the 

willing ones— which under favorable circumstances 

would prove to be friends of 

righteousness, friends of God, and which 

would prove to be enemies of righteousness, 

enemies of God. But God, who 

reads the thoughts and intents of the 

heart, knoweth well. Yea, he foreknew 

that there would be such, before he created 

Adam; and in his wonderful plan, arranged 

before the foundation of the world, 

the Lamb slain had a place, and was his 

provision,— not for those whom he foresaw 

would, under full light and opportunity, 

be wilful sinners, enemies of himself 

and his righteous government, but for 

those whom he foresaw would, when 

they would have full opportunity, become 

his friends, because at heart always 

willing and preferring righteousness rather 

than sin. It was for such ultimate 

"friends" that God provided the sacrifice 

of his Son, the redemption which is in 

Christ Jesus, and not for those who shall 

ultimately prove themselves enemies. 

All mankind are enemies or opposers of 
God and righteousness, so far as their imperfect 
conduct or works are concerned, 
though all are not such at heart. Thus 
Christ died only for his friends (those 
at heart the friends of righteousness) while 
in fact those friends were all, more or less, 
opposing righteousness (unintentional enemies) 
by reason of the weaknesses and 
imperfections of their fallen state. Thus 
seen, two texts seemingly contradictory 
are in perfect accord: "While we were 
yet enemies we were reconciled to God by 
the death of his Son," and "Greater love 
hath no man than this, that a man lay 
down his life for his friends —ye are my 
friends" —whoever will render heart-obedience 
to God's perfect, righteous law.— 
Rom. 5:10 ; John 15:13 . 

MAN'S FREE WILL. 

Returning to Adam and his family, outcasts 
from Eden and from all that it represented 
of divine favor and communion 
and the conditionally-promised life everlasting, 
let us study for a moment their 



mental attitudes toward God. Were they 
friends or enemies? 

Legally they were all enemies —violators 
of God's just and good laws, condemned 
to death therefor by their good and just 
Creator. But if their wills, their hearts, 
be examined to see whether they were still 

wilfully and maliciously opposed to God 
and righteousness, determinedly wilful 
opposers, as Satan for instance, we find 
some of each sort— some who would rejoice 
in iniquity and feel and act maliciously 
toward the right, and others who 
would fain be back again in full fellowship 
and communion with God, desiring 
and delighting to do his will and sorrowful 
for the past. 

Everything connected with the narrative 
in Genesis tends to show that both Adam 
and Eve were deeply penitent and looked 
longingly to the Lord for the reconciliation 
and restoration to his favor hinted at 
in the statement that the seed of the woman 
should bruise the serpent's head- 
crush evil. Seemingly this hope was associated 
with the birth of each of Eve's 
sons. Their names seem to indicate this. 
The name of her first-born son, Cain, in 
the Hebrew much resembles in meaning 
the word Eureka —"I have found it"— 
or I have got the expected one. Abel, 
the name of the second son, indicates 
doubt or uncertainty; Cain in the meantime, 
no doubt, having manifested the evil 
disposition, afterward so clearly marked 
in his history. The godly character of 
Abel seems to have revived her hope, 
that of her offspring one should arise 
who would somehow vanquish Satan and 
evil, and bring back the fellowship and 
blessing of God; consequently when her 
third son was born Eve named him Instead 

(i.e., Seth), for she said, "God 
hath appointed me another seed INSTEAD 
of Abel whom Cain slew." ( Gen. 4:25 .) 
And, indeed, the hope that she might be 
the mother of the long promised "seed 
of the woman" seems to have filled the 
heart of Eve's daughters through the line 
of the family of godly Seth, all the way 
down to and including Mary, our Lord's 
mother.— Luke 1:41-55 . 

In Adam and Eve and their first three 
sons we have a clearly marked showing of 
the human will, and the fact that God 
does not give us our wills but that each 



individual is accountable for his own will; 
while God only influences our wills to 
the extent of setting before us certain information, 
upon which each one's will 
must decide or act for himself. (Thus 
God works or operates in us, the church, 
who have already willed to serve and 
obey him, by continued unfoldings of his 
Word and plan, so that we, already right-willed, 
may continue to will and continue 
to do his good pleasure, more and more. 
— Phil. 2:13 .) As increasing light shows 
the propriety of increasing zeal and sacrifice, 
it also shows with increasing clearness 
the grandeur of the things which 
God hath in reservation for them that love 
him —his "friends, who do whatsoever he 
commands." We need not question God's 
power; we know that he could have created 
man without a will; but he did not 
do so; he created him in this as well as 
in some other respects in his own likeness 
or image— with ability to will for himself. 
And we have never found a member of 
the human family fallen so low that he 
had no will of his own —except idiots, 
who are clearly not accountable. Even 
those who are fallen so low that they seem 
to have no power to control their conduct 
by their wills, still have the will. "To 
will is present with me, but how to perform 
I find not," not only represented 
the Jew's condition but that of all fallen 
men. A thief may have the organ of acquisitiveness 
large and the organ of conscientiousness 
small and may therefore by 
reason of this mental unbalance have a 
predisposition to steal. Yet he has, at 
least, some conception of the wrong he 
commits, and he steals with a certain 
amount of wilfulness or unwillingness. 
A will in the matter he must have, even 
though it be so weak (because unsupported 
by good elements of organization and because 
opposed by bad elements of organization) 
that he cannot carry out his will 
but is continually falling into sins which, 
when out of the heat of temptation, he 
may mourn over. Hence, we repeat, there 
is in every man a will. 

That God delights in the freedom of 
will in all his creatures is evident, also, 
from the fact that he has given this faculty 
to them all, even to the very smallest insects. 
Go to the ant— consider her ways, 
and see how much will power she evidences. 



Take a drop of water and examine 
with a microscope its living creatures; 
that even they have wills of their 
own, must be apparent to all. Much more 
man, made to be God's representative in 
the earth, and its king,— man has a will, 
and to it God appeals; and in harmony 
with its laws and liberties, which he gave 
it, God and his laws always operate. 

While Adam and Eve and their second 
son Abel, and their third son Seth, developed 
wills which desired righteousness 
and reconciliation with God, Cain, their 
first-born son, developed a will opposed to 
righteousness; proud and self-willed, he 
had no desire to submit his will to God's 
will, and did not aspire to the reconciliation 
promised to be provided; he, no 
doubt, regretted the loss of Eden and 
would have liked to be restored to it, but 
not upon God's conditions of absolute 
obedience to God's righteous will and arrangements. 
He would have loved the 
reward of obedience and righteousness, 
but was unwilling to accept the terms; 
he did not will to be God's friend upon 
the only conditions God offered, or ever 
will offer, his friendship and communion. 
He consequently opened his heart to unbounded 
ambition and selfishness which 
brought in envy, hatred and malice, 
and led him to murder his brother Abel, 
because his life and his offering, submitted 
more fully to the will of God, were more 
acceptable to God than his own. Not 

R1175 : page 4 

having submitted his own will to God's 
will and righteous plan, Cain hated his 
brother, and from envy deliberately 
planned and executed his murder. 

It cannot be claimed that Cain's will 
was weakened and depraved by heredity, 
for he was Adam's first-born. He had 
plenty of will- power, as much as his brother 
Abel, but he misdirected his will. He 
willingly copied Satan, while Abel was 
copying God. Yielding himself to evil, 
he allowed an evil or sinful will to be begotten 
in him and then nursed it into a 
murderous, devilish will or disposition, 
hating good and loving and doing evil. 
And so, as those who pattern and conform 
their wills to God's will are children of 
God, of Cain it is written that he, willingly 



copying Satan's disposition, became a 
son "of that wicked one."— 1 John 3:12 . 

Likewise, our Lord spoke to some of 
the malicious Pharisees, whose wills were 
set in opposition to the truth, who, instead 
of seeking God's will and way, were 
Satan-like, seeking their own exaltation 
and hating the right and the light, saying: 
"Ye are [children] of your father 
the devil." So the Apostle once spoke 
to a similar character, a wilful evil-doer, 
saying, "O full of all subtilty and all 
mischief, thou child of the devil; wilt 
thou not cease to pervert the right way of 
the Lord?" -Acts 13:10 . 

NO PROVISION FOR GOD'S ENEMIES. 

Notice now that God has never purposed 
or promised blessings upon wilful 
enemies. Eternal life and kingdom favors 
are not for such. Had all the race 
been such characters, no redemption and 
no restitution would have been provided. 
God foresaw, however, that many (the 
vast majority, we doubt not) would, after 
seeing clearly and in some degree experiencing 
both good and evil, right and 
wrong, and their respective consequences 
under God's law, be glad to recognize 
and serve God and the right —with all 
their heart, mind, soul and strength; 

R1176 : page 4 

and to observe the same law in their dealings 

with their fellow-creatures— loving 

their neighbors as themselves. It was because 

God foresaw these would-be friends 

in the Adamic race that for such he provided 

redemption and reconciliation 

through the blood of the crucified one. 

"Greater love hath no man than this, 

that a man lay down his life for his 

FRIENDS. Ye are my FRIENDS, if ye do 

whatsoever I command you.— Love one 

another as I have loved you." 

We do not forget that the same great 
Teacher said, "Love your enemies" and 
"If thine enemy hunger feed him"— 
help to keep him alive. This command to 
us is very different from what God reveals 
concerning his own plan of procedure toward 
his wilful enemies, of whom he 
caused it to be written:— "The enemies 
of the Lord shall lick the dust;"— shall 



fall in death— they "shall die;" they 
"shall be cut off" from life; "all the 
wicked will he destroy." [He will not feed 
them and continue their lives everlastingly.] 
"They shall be punished with an 
everlasting destruction from the presence 
of the Lord and from the glory of his 
power; when he shall come to be glorified 
in his saints and to be admired by all 
them that believe in that [Millennial] 
day." - Psa. 72:9 ; Ezek. 18:4 ; Num. 15:31 ; 
Psa. 145:20 ; 2 Thes. 1:9,10 . 

And his reason for thus giving us a 
different rule from that which he himself 
will follow is readily seen. The enmities 
and oppositions of the present time 
among men are mostly attributable to 
mutual weaknesses and imperfections and 
misunderstandings; and we who are totally 
incapable of reading and judging the 
hearts, the underlying motives, the wills of 
our fellow-men, could not unerringly judge 
which are the few real enemies of righteousness 
and which, its many blinded, deceived 
or only partly informed or over-tempted 
friends. Therefore, if thine enemy 
hunger, feed him; he is probably a 
deceived friend of God and hence of 
yours. As for the few times when by 
feeding our starving enemy we should really 
help perpetuate a being unworthy of 
life and whom God has declared should 
be and shall be destroyed, the Lord tells 
us to leave that to him, that he has not 
yet made us the representatives and executors 
of his laws. But he does tell us 
also that no real enemy of his and ours, 
no informed and really wilful enemy of 
righteousness, shall escape just punishment 
because of our exercise of leniency. 
He declares, "Vengeance is mine, I will 
repay, saith the Lord." Therefore, dearly 
beloved "avenge not yourselves"— 
follow instructions, feed all enemies and 
trust to the Lord who can and will, in 
his due time, render "vengeance to his 
enemies."— Rom. 12:19 ; Jas. 5:1-6 . 

And God, indeed, for a time follows the 
very rule thus laid down for us. He does not 
now destroy his enemies, but feeds them; 
sending rain upon the just and upon the 
unjust and causing the sun to shine upon 
the evil as well as the good. God waits, 
as he tells us to do, until his due time arrives, 
when (during the Millennial age) 
he shall cause the knowledge of his 



character, his plan and his laws to be 
clearly and fully made known to all men. 
Then the real enemies, the wilful evildoers, 
shall be manifested; and the multitude 
of present enemies, through inherited 
weaknesses, deceptions, and misconceptions, 
whom he foresees will become his 
friends, shall be manifested also. Then the 
"friends," the "sheep," shall enter into 
life— the second life, the non-ending life; 
while the "enemies," the "goats," shall be 
cut off from life— enter into death, the second 
death, non-ending death;— an "everlasting 
destruction from the presence of the 
Lord" and from all further opposition to 
his glory and power. Self-willed Satan, 
and all his children, all who willingly 
prefer his course of enmity to God and 
righteousness, shall go into destruction 
(symbolized by the lake of fire) "the 
second death." ( Rev. 20:14 .) God seeketh 
not to bend the unwilling, but is 
pleased to receive and help and restore 
the willing ones. He does not propose 
to use his power to chain unwilling devils 
to his throne, but to open through Christ 
a way to life by which whosoever wills 
may come and partake freely. Neither 
will God destroy the wills of the unwilling 
and make them mere machines; rather 
than have such children he could and 
would, as our Lord declared, create men 
out of stones. ( Matt. 3:9 .) No; God 
"seeketh such to worship him [and to 
enjoy his favors] as worship him [willingly] 
in spirit and in truth." All the good 
things which God hath in reservation are 
for those who love him.— 1 Cor. 2:9 . 

For this purpose of proving and manifesting 
who are the friends of God, "God 
hath appointed a day [a time— the Millennial 
day] in the which he will judge 
[grant a trial to] the world, in righteousness 
[It will be a just, fair trial, full, complete, 
final], by that man whom he hath 
afore ordained— Jesus Christ, the righteous 
one." He must reign [andjudge, 
and the Church shall reign andjudge with 
him- 1 Cor. 15:25 ; 2 Tim. 2:12 ] until 
he hath put all enemies under his feet" 
(—not upon thrones of honor), and until he 
has liberated all the groaning, travailing and 
sin-sick creation from the bondage of corruption 
and death into that freedom from 
pain, sorrow and dying which is the divine 
provision for all the sons of God. ( Rom. 8:21 .) 



Yea, God's Anointed shall not 
only reign, but reign in righteousness. 
He will lay justice to the line and righteousness 
to the plummet, and the hail shall 
sweep away the refuge and delusions of 
lies, and he will stamp out evil and wilful 
evil-doers forever. ( Isa. 28:17 .) The God 
of peace will introduce lasting peace and 
blessing by crushing Satan and all his wilful 
children (his wilful followers, who in spite 
of full knowledge, will, like him and with 
his spirit, love evil rather than good) under 
the feet of the Christ —shortly.— 
Rom. 16:20 . 

Then, having finished his work, having 
bought the sheep and having found 
all of this sheep class of mankind who 
had all been lost in the wilderness of sin, 
the Good Shepherd, who knows all his 
sheep (and who will be known by all of 
them, when once they clearly and distinctly 
hear his voice), having destroyed 
the wolves of sin and the wilful goats, 
will bring all the sheep safely and happily 
back to the Eden fold of God, and shall 
deliver up the kingdom to God, even the 
Father, that God and his law and his fold 
may be to such henceforth, forever, their 
all in all. Thenceforth, there shall be no 
more pain, nor sorrow, nor sickness, nor 
dying, nor cause for these; for sin and 
they that loved sin, and all the former 
things shall have passed away forever. 
Thenceforth, all things are new and perfect 
and right and good. 

"WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD 
THERE IS NO REMISSION OF SINS." 

HEB. 9:22 . 

Having looked at the class whom God 
desired to restore to his favor, his 
"friends" (including all those who will 
ever become his friends, obedient to his 
righteous regulations), let us look now at 
the method adopted by divine wisdom for 
effecting reconciliation or atonement between 
God and these. 

That a number of the patriarchs were 
quite willing to be reconciled again to 
God, to be at-one with him and repossess 
themselves of the blessings of Eden, which 
he had prepared for those at-one with 
him, is very evident. It is also evident 
that God would not and did not permit 



that full, complete reconciliation; that 
though he did permit those who longed 
for his friendship and who desired to know 
and to do his will, to have a measure of 
his friendship, what he granted was far 
from full and complete fellowship. He 
never restored them either to the comforts 
or the everlasting -life conditions of Eden. 
Whatever fellowship was granted came to 
them as they were given to Adam, as loving 
provisions. And even the limited 
fellowship, the limited at-one-ment permitted, 
was so hedged about with typical 
sacrifices for sins as to clearly indicate to 
these would-be-friends of God that they 
were unclean —unfit to be recognized by 
God, or to be at-one with him, or to have 
his favors. To appreciate the reason why 
God thus held aloof from men, and how 
full and complete reconciliation has since 
been accomplished between God and 
those who are desirous of being at-one 
with him, and how, ultimately, all the 
"friends" of God shall be sought and 
found, and brought to one-ness with him, 
is to appreciate the philosophy of the plan 
of Salvation, conceived by God before 
the foundation of the world, begun at our 
Redeemer's first advent, and to be completed 
with the close of his Millennial 
reign. 

Obedience to his Creator is not only 
the proper and reasonable course for 
man, but it is the course essential to his 
happiness; for disobedience is not only 
sinful ingratitude, but it is injurious to 
man, who has not the experience and wisdom 
essential to a proper guidance of his 
own affairs. God's regulation, therefore, 
is that his wisdom, his power, his care and 
his love, must be trusted in implicitly by 
all; and his will must be the only law, if 
harmony, peace and blessing to all would 
prevail. He will have nothing short of 
this; hence he would not countenance 
the slightest disobedience on the part of 
the perfect Adam and would not excuse 
disobedience. He would, instead, illustrate, 
to all his intelligent creatures, 
how imperative and unalterable are his 
laws, how disastrous and far-reaching are 
the consequences of disobedience, and 
how necessary his laws are to the general 
well-being of all his creatures. 

Notwithstanding, therefore, God's loving 
sympathy for Adam, and his foreknowledge 



of all the dreadful consequences 
upon his posterity, God determined 
to make an example of the sinner 
and of the natural consequences of sin, and 
so the penalty of sin went into effect. He 
cast Adam out from the garden of Eden 
and all its favors; he no longer treated 
him as his loved creature and friend but 
as one who had rebelled; he virtually said, 

R1177 : page 4 

you have chosen your own path, now walk 

in it, take the consequences, use your own 

will and see where it will land you, and 

how much more joy and liberty you will 

have than if you had remained under my 

easy yoke and light burden— my easy requirement 

of obedience. 

Yet, while treating mankind thus, on 
the lines of justice, God had already 
planned for the recovery of all such of 
the human family as would desire to render 
full obedience to his just laws and arrangements. 
He could not change his 
laws to suit the imperfect, fallen, weak 
condition of such as desired to return to 
full obedience and favor; he could not 
accept as perfect that which was far from 
perfection. To do so would bring confusion 
into God's kingdom, and for 
him to recognize sin and affiliate with 
sinners and in any degree countenance 
their sins and weaknesses would be to 
partake of sin and be a partner in it with 
sinners. 

It is asked, Why did God not restore 
men from death— from sickness, pain and 
mental and moral imperfection, and from 
the tomb— and then let them show their 
harmony and obedience? We answer, that 
was impossible! It is impossible for God to 
lie or to deny himself, or his own sentence 
against sin. ( Heb. 6:18; 2 Tim. 2: 13 .) 
God's sentence against sin was that "the 

soul that sinneth, it shall die;" and even 
God himself could not now change that 
sentence; hence God could not restore 
the condemned and dying and dead race 
and offer them another trial: Adam had 
been tried and had failed, and the sentence 
was passed and could never be altered, 
because God's law, like himself, 
changes not, forever. 

But some will inquire, Did not the 
death of Adam meet the penalty? and 



could not God justly have made him alive 
and perfect again the next moment after 
life had become extinct— the next moment 
after the penalty had been fully inflicted? 
No; you misunderstand the penalty 
of sin. You seem to think of the 
matter as though the penalty of sin read, 
The being who sins shall cease to exist 
for a moment, or more, as a penalty for his 
sin: or, The wages of sin is a temporary 
suspension of existence: or, The body of 

R1177 : page 5 

the person who sins shall die. But none 
of these properly represent the penalty, 
which was that the soul should die— the 
being should cease to exist. When this 
penalty is fully studied and realized, it 
will be seen that utter extinction of being 
was the penalty, and that a merely 
temporary suspension of animation would 
not be a fulfillment of it. 

How, then, could any hope of a future 
and everlasting life be entertained for any? 
From a human standpoint there was no 
room for hope, because there could be no 
room for expecting God to break his word 
or change his righteous law. But nevertheless, 
God held out a hope to such as 
desired and endeavored to return to his 
favor, though he did not explain the process 
by which he would recover them, but 
left that for faith to reason upon. And 
faith reasoned that if God could not break 
his word about the penalty, he could not 
break it with reference to the recovery 
from it. 

Even the shadowy sacrifices and typical 
services of the Law-Covenant, made with 
the seed of Abraham, but slightly disclosed 
what would be God's method of 
meeting the penalty inflicted upon Adam 
and his family and canceling it, so far as 
it would work injury and loss of existence 
to those of the race whom God loves and 
calls his "friends"— even all who love 
righteousness, and God the King of the 
righteous, and also all who would do so 
if they fully and clearly understood the 
truth. We, however, who live since the 
great Redeemer came and gave his life for 
"his sheep" [not for the "goats"], and 
who are of his sheep, are privileged to understand 
these "mysteries" of Jehovah's 
plan (Matt. 13:11 ; John 16:13 ), so that 



we may not only fully and clearly comprehend 

the portion of it already accomplished, 

viz., the ransom given for the 

life of Adam and all who lost life through 

his disobedience, but listening to the great 

Shepherd's voice, gradually, more and 

more, the length and breadth and height 

and depth of that plan are revealed to us; 

showing us that the results of Christ's 

obedience to the Father's plan, in the 

voluntary sacrifice of himself (the man 

Christ Jesus) as Adam's substitute or ransom-price, 

will fully and completely offset 

and cancel the penalty upon Adam and 

his children. 

How, now, does the case stand in view 
of the ransom given by our Redeemer at 
Calvary— Did it secure everlasting life 
for that entire race of sinners? 

No; it did not secure everlasting life, 
nor even a right to it, either for Adam 
or for a single one of his posterity. 

What then did Christ's death accomplish 
for men? 

It merely and only canceled and set 
aside the penalty upon Adam for that first 
disobedience;— which penalty, as long as 
it remained against the race, prohibited 
their ever returning to perfection and life. 
Now, they may return to divine fellowship 
and favor, and thence to perfection 
and everlasting life, if they can do so. 

But men are unable to recover themselves 
"out of the horrible pit and out of 
the miry clay" of sin, which has become 
a great cancer upon the bodies and minds 
and morals of our race, which, however 
loathsome and abhorrent to those who 
long for purity and righteousness, has become 
a part of our very being and is 
sapping and drawing the life forces daily 
and hourly. And these cry out, Oh! 
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver 
me from this corrupt state and set me free 
so that I might do right and be in harmony 
with God and have his blessing and 
favor and gift of everlasting life! 

The ransom opened the way for the 
powerful Mediator to establish the New 
Covenant with all desirous of reconciliation. 
Before that sacrifice for Adam's 
sin was made, God could not enter into 
covenant relations with those under death-sentence 
for violating his laws. Nor could 
Christ as Mediator offer pardon or restore 
to perfection of life those under divine 



sentence, without opposing God's perfect 
law; which he could not and would not do. 

As an illustration, Suppose that a bookkeeper 
in governmental employ had proven 
dishonest and had been legally sentenced 
and imprisoned for the offense; 
and suppose the penalty was one that 
could be met by the payment of a money 
fine; suppose that the man had thoroughly 
repented and reformed and made such 
restitution as he could for his embezzlements; 
suppose that a friend of his, a 
physician, knowing all about the case, 
should pay the fine and secure his release; 
suppose, too, that the government officials 
were willing that he should return to his 
old position and former salary, but suppose 
that the man had during his confinement 
become paralyzed and lost his ability 
to write and to calculate. All will see 
that a payment of his fine [his ransom] 
could not restore him to his former work 
and pay, if he could not fill the requirements. 
But if the physician who redeemed 
him from the condemnation of the law 
by paying his fine should also be skillful 
in treating his disease and restoring him 
to his former condition and thus to his 
former employ and its wages, the two-fold 
work of Christ as Redeemer and Restorer 
would be illustrated in him. 

Christ's death as man's ransom sets free 
from condemnation, fully, entirely; but 
the effect of sin has paralyzed all mankind, 
mentally, morally and physically, so that 
the good that we would we often cannot 
do. We are, therefore, notwithstanding 
the ransom, wholly unable to fill the original 
place in God's service designed for 
us, and are unable, therefore, to get the 
wages of righteousness— everlasting life. 
Mankind must still look to Christ, the 
Redeemer, and, earnestly desiring it, put 
themselves under the treatment of this 
Great Physician for the restoration of all 
the lost powers. And such as come to 
him, he will not refuse, but will put them 
under the strict regimen of the New Covenant, 
and so long as they continue thereunder 
he will treat their cases, correcting, 
instructing, exercising them, etc., until 
they are fully cured and restored to the 
lost portion and favors. 

Praise God for the all-important work 
accomplished at the cross, by which the 
sentence of extinction was lifted from the 



race! yet it is very evident that since 
God's law continues the same yesterday, 
to-day, and forever, and since he still 
must and does refuse full communion and 
fellowship with sinners, and since we cannot 
recover ourselves from the plague of 
sin, it is very evident, indeed, that some 
great physician, able to cure our malady 
and to restore us to mental, moral and 
physical health and perfection, must be 
sent to us by our gracious Creator or our 
case would still be hopeless. 

God knew this all along, and so provided 
that the obedient one who, willingly, 
for our redemption left the heavenly 
nature and glory and became a man, that 
as a man he might give himself a ransom 
(a corresponding price) for and instead of 
the first man, the transgressor ( 1 Tim. 2:6 ; 

1 Cor. 15:21 ), should be the one 
who, as the great Physician, Savior and 
Life-giver, should not only redeem Adam 
and his children from the sentence and 
penalty of extinction, but should "save 
HIS PEOPLE from their sins;" and delivering 
these, his people, from sin and death, 
should finally present them perfect, blameless, 
unreprovable before the Father, fit 
objects of his love and communion, restored 
to the divine likeness, in which 
they will be able, as father Adam was in 
Eden, to fully comprehend and fully perform 
all the divine requirements. And 
in addition to what Adam had, they will 
have the valuable experiences of the present 
time, proving to them the love of their 
Creator and Lord and giving assurance 
that he and all his laws seek only their 
permanent blessing and joy. 

CENTRE AND CIRCUMFERENCE. 

The hope of the world, then, has a 
circumference as well as a centre; the 
centre is the Redemption or Ransom, 
the circumference the Deliverance, the 

R1178 : page 5 

Life-giving, the Restitution to the divine 
favors; and the various provisions and 
conditions of the New Covenant connect 
this centre with its circumference as spokes 
do in a wheel. 

Only by following the New Covenant 
provisions can any of the redeemed reach 



the grand limits of perfection. Its provisions, 
however, are ample for the bringing 
of all the willing ones to a condition, 
mental, moral and physical, where God 
can recognize them as worthy of his favor 
and communion. Those who recognize the 
sacrifice of Christ as the Ransom-price of 
the race have it as an assurance of the 
sincerity of God's promises of deliverance, 
and as a practical demonstration of 
his sympathy and love which amounts to 
a conviction that he will in his own due 
time do all that he ever promised;— "exceeding 
abundantly more than we can 
ask" or at present imagine.— Eph. 3:20 . 

As the long delay of over 4000 years 
until the Ransom was given perplexed the 
Lord's faithful among the Jews, so the 
long delay of the Great Physician, as the 
Life-giver, the Restorer, since his giving 
of the Ransom, since the release from the 
sentence of extinction ( Rom. 4:17-19 ), 
has greatly perplexed many of the Lord's 
faithful ones during the Gospel age. But 
now, as his due time comes for the further 
explanation of his plan to his people 
( Dan. 12:9,10 ; Luke 12:37 ), it is all 
made clear and plain. We now see that 
the past six thousand years were used in 
God's plan for the multiplying of the 
race, sufficient to fill the earth when as a 
whole it is made a Paradise, fit for perfect 
men in fellowship with God; and that 
during this period, long to us as measured 
by the short measure of present existence, 
but short to the great Eternal, each generation 
played its noble or ignoble part 
and got its lessons and experiences with 
sin and its consequences, and was laid 
away in the dust. There they await the 
coming of the great Deliverer, fully 
authorized by the satisfaction of the 
sentence upon us, secured by his own 
payment of the penalty against us; 
and fully competent, by reason of his own 
resurrection and high exaltation to the 
divine nature ( 2 Pet. 1:4 ), to "save 
unto the uttermost" all who will come 
unto the Father by him. He shall come in 
power and great dignity, and, opening 
the prison doors of the tomb, shall call 
back to being, in orderly succession, the 
generations of the dead, and offer to each 
and to all fullest opportunity to demonstrate 
their willingness to come into full 
harmony and covenant relationship with 



God, upon the only conditions which God 
can or will or ought to make, viz., absolute, 
prompt and willing obedience to his 
righteous government, which is wisely instituted 
for man's eternal happiness. 

God's people see, further, that the delay 
since the payment of the ransom-price 
has been utilized by God for the call and 
testing and selecting of a "little flock" 
of specially zealous and earnest lovers of 
righteousness; whose testing is specially 
severe, because accomplished during the 
period in which error and wrong and sin 
are permitted to triumph and hold sway 
in the world; in a time when it costs the 
sacrifice of much that is convenient and 
pleasurable. But if called to endure more 
than will be exacted of the world in general, 
during the Millennial reign of the 
great Deliverer, they have also exceeding 
great and precious promises, of divine 
favor and honors, far beyond those given 
to Adam and to be restored to all the 
willing ones of his posterity. 

While the obedient world, in general, 
will have human life and honors and every 
earthly good restored to them by the 
great Mediator of the New Covenant, as 
the reward of obedience to God's regulations 
under favorable conditions, the 
"little flock," selected during the Gospel 
age, are to have a new nature given to 
them; they are to be "changed," from 
human to divine nature ( 2 Pet. 1:4 ), and 
to have correspondingly changed bodies, 
no longer flesh and blood and bones, but 
immortal spirit-bodies. Now begotten of 
God's spirit through his word of promise, 
they pledge themselves to sacrifice the 
earthly, human interests, blessings, honors 
and pleasures (to which they, in common 
with the lovers of righteousness, friends 
of God, of the whole world, are heirs according 
to the New Covenant), that instead 
they might obtain the still higher 
favor of joint-heirship with Christ Jesus, 
the Redeemer, under the Abrahamic Covenant; 
to be the Seed of blessing, through 
whom the divine plan of the New Covenant 
shall be extended to whosoever wills, 
and shall save all of God's "friends," 
his "sheep," "his people, from their 
sins."- Matt. 1:21 . 



R1178 : page 5 

THE NEW COVENANT IN HIS BLOOD. 

It is important that we should see, clearly, 
that in God's arrangement for the reconciling 
to himself of the world, i.e., of 
such of the world as do or shall, after fuller 
knowledge of the Lord, earnestly desire 
a reconciliation, he in no degree 
compromises the matter of sin; he in no 
way lifts one particle of the penalty first 
pronounced against sin. His proposition, 
first and last, is to "save HIS PEOPLE from 
their sins," not in them. And it is only 
"his people" that he will save (deliver, 
clear, release) from the power and consequences 
of their sins. While all are released 
from the condemnation of Adam's 
sin, each has a varying quantity and variety 
of sins and imperfections of his own, 
only partially the results of inherited 
weaknesses, to be gotten rid of before 
he can be perfected and fit for the favors 
and covenant-relationship of Jehovah. 
This is the work which Christ Jesus now 
does for his church, the consecrated, and 
this is the work which, in a little different 
form, Christ and his church, his Bride, 
are to do for "whosoever wills" of all 
the race, during the Millennial age. 

The Lord's method in dealing with his 
Church, the "little flock" of the Gospel 
age, is as follows: He assures us that if 
we fully accept of him, first as our Redeemer 
who bought us with his own precious 
blood, and secondly, if we desire 
to avail ourselves of the privileges, thus 
afforded us, of returning to obedience 
and harmony and fellowship with God, 
and to the lasting life and blessings which 
these conditions secure, he will own us as 

R1178 : page 6 

friends of God, for whom the New Covenant 
was made; and that under the conditions 
of that covenant all such may 
reckon forgiven all the sins of the past 
(and all the sins and errors of future days 
which they may unwillingly commit). 
And this state of reckoned forgiveness, 
reckoned purity, reckoned soundness and 
sinlessness, is termed "justification by 
faith," because it is not an actual righting 
and perfecting of the sinner. If he abides 



in covenant-relationship with God, that 
is, if he continues to trust in the redeeming 
blood of Christ, and continues to 
despise sin and to desire and seek fellowship 
with God— so long he is reckoned 
and treated as "justified freely from all 
things." And if he should ignorantly 
and unintentionally do a wrong, which 
knowingly and realizingly he would not 
have done, his justification continues; such 
a transgression is not reckoned to be a sin 
under the favorable conditions of the New 
Covenant. Even though, under strong 
temptation, such an one should stumble 
and commit a sin, yet his heart remain 
true to the Lord, so that reflection upon 
the act or word shall cause sorrow and 
contrite repentance and so far as possible 
a correction of the wrong— this shall not 
be treated as a violation and cancellation 
of his justification under the New Covenant 
(though he may receive "stripes," 
"chastisements," for his correction); because 
his heart, his will, is still loyal toward 
God, so that he would not have 
committed the transgression had he been 
strong and able to resist the temptation. 
The corrective dealings of the 
Lord with such will, however, teach them 
that they must go to him for strength for 
every weakness, that his strength may be 
perfectly manifested, even through their 
weaknesses. 

But if the individual should turn from 
righteousness to love sin, or if he should 
reject the precious blood (sacrifice) of 
Christ, by which the New Covenant came 
into operation, and by which he had once 
been sanctified ( Heb. 6:4-8 ; 10:26-31 ), 
his justification is canceled, he is no longer 
reckoned justified, perfect, but his sin 
remains. He is yet in his sins; in the 
very gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. 
To such the special favors of God 
are closed, though with the whole world 
they share the general bounties— rain, 
sunshine, food, etc., and perhaps may 
prosper beyond many of the Lord's 
"friends," the covenant-keepers, during 
the present time, while evil is permitted 
to rule the earth. 

We would have it clearly seen that 
earnest desire after righteousness and reconciliation 
with God, and the recognition 
of Christ's ransom-sacrifice as the only 
way by which this desire can be accomplished, 



are the only conditions upon 

which the Lord God will enter into any 

covenant with the condemned and imperfect 

children of Adam, now or in the 

coming age. And the moment these conditions 

are complied with by any, that 

moment they are reckoned and treated as 

though they were perfect and sinless, as 

the happy objects of divine love and favor, 

except that they are not released at 

once from the aches and pains and imperfections 

which sin brought on them. 

But, why are not all such "friends" of 
righteousness at once released from the encumbrances 
and penalties of sin? Because 
divine wisdom (which, as we grow in 
grace, we are more and more able to appreciate) 
sees best to test and prove the 
sincerity of our professed love and promised 
obedience to his arrangements. Our 
everlasting fidelity must be assured; it 
must be demonstrated that our turning to 
God is more than a fancy, a whim, an 
experiment on our part. All experimenting 
must all be done in the present or in 
the Millennial age, and the real, final, fixed 
preference of each must be ascertained; 
whether he chooses righteousness (and 
thus chooses everlasting life, its reward) 
or whether he prefers sin (and thus chooses 

R1179 : page 6 

everlasting destruction, extinction— its reward). 

Because, God's purpose, as he declares 

it, is that sin and imperfection shall 

not be permitted to go beyond the close of 

the Millennium; that all who do not prefer 

and rejoice in righteousness shall be cut 

off; and that sin and its consequences, pain, 

sorrow and dying, shall never more be 

permitted to mar the perfect bliss of eternity 

among any of his creatures. So, 

then, it is for our everlasting good as well 

as for the good of all God's creatures that 

he does not at once actually justify (make 

perfect) all who profess to accept the New 

Covenant conditions. The reckoned justification, 

or justification by faith, answers 

every purpose best; it permits the return 

to favor and fellowship and introduces the 

sin-sick soul to the great Physician and 

Life-giver, who sees to it that the wounds 

do not heal merely on the surface to break 

out afresh, but keeps them open at the 

surface until they heal thoroughly from 



the heart outward. 

In general, as thus far considered, the 
New Covenant has the same effects upon 
the contrite believers of the Gospel age 
that it will have upon the same class of 
the coming Millennial age. But now 
we will notice some differences. During 
the Millennium, while each one who desires 
reconciliation and accepts of the Redeemer 
as the way, the truth, and the life, 
will thereby come under the conditions 
of the New Covenant and by faith may 
instantly realize his justification, his pardon, 
and his at-one-ment with God, 
though still actually imperfect (just as the 
same class now do), he will not, as we do, 
continue on in imperfection down to the 
tomb, but will gradually (more or less 
rapidly, in proportion to his love of righteousness 
and trust in the Redeemer, who 
will then also be his King) make progress 
toward perfection— mentally, morally 
and physically, until at the close of that 
age of trial ("judgment") all mankind 
shall have had fullest knowledge of the 
wages of sin and of the wages of righteousness, 
and under fullest opportunity 
each will have made his choice (as well 
all who will have fallen into the Adamic 
death, which Christ's ransom-sacrifice has 
changed into a limited "sleep," as those 
who will be awake at the time that reign 
of righteousness begins); and each one 
worthy of everlasting life will by that time 
have attained perfection. Thus, the general 
perfecting of God's "friends," "his 
people," Christ's followers or "sheep," 
will be gradual. This is the general resurrection 

[raising up] which shall, inch by 
inch, during Christ's reign, lift up, up, up, 
out of death and all its imperfections, all 
whom the Lord, their Judge, shall find 
worthy of life; so that all that was lost 
in Adam shall be restored by Christ, the 
Second Adam— perfection of organism 
and perfection of life (vitality) and perfection 
of joy in fellowship with God. 

This difference, however, in the method 
of dealing with them and with us, is 
not owing to a difference in the operation 
of the New Covenant, as might at first 
appear, but to the change of administration 
—to the fact that the development of 
another feature of the divine plan makes 
the change of dealing expedient. 

The New Covenant relates not to the 



method, by which restitution will come 

to those who come into this covenant-relationship, 

but to the restoration of harmony 

or at-one-ment between God and 

"his people." His people, being degraded 

in sin, and imperfect, are unfit for at-one-ment 

with their holy Creator, and the 

New Covenant is the name of the new 

arrangement God is willing to enter into 
with these, through the merit of Christ's 
death, reckoning them and treating with 
them as though perfect, until the Great 
Teacher and Restorer shall have perfected 
them actually. Then, the New Covenant 
will be at an end; and there will be no 
further use for it, since there will no longer 
be any creature to bring into harmony 
with God, all then being in a condition 
of fullest harmony and obedience. And 
then, too, the special work of Christ as 

Mediator of the New Covenant will be 
at an end, for the same reasons.— 

1 Cor. 15:25-28 . 

The Millennial period is the proper 
time in God's arrangement for the Lord 
Jesus, as Judge and Law-giver, to try or 
judge the world, to prove which are worthy 
of life and to raise them up to it; and 
to prove which are unworthy, and to cut 
them off forever in the second death, as 
unworthy cumberers of the ground. So, 
then, the offer of the New Covenant conditions 
and privileges to any is the offer 
of life everlasting upon God's conditions; 
it is the offer of a resurrection; for, as we 
have heretofore shown, the mere awakening 
of mankind from the sleep of the 
tomb is not, by a great deal, all that is 
meant by the word resurrection (Greek, 

anastasis). The awakening is merely the 
first or preliminary step which, under the 
beneficent arrangement of the New Covenant, 
will furnish opportunity to all to 
come to a full knowledge of God's love 
and gracious provision. Then, by coming 
into willing harmony with the provisions 
and conditions of the New Covenant, Life, 
in the full, true sense of the word, may be 
gradually attained by whosoever wills. 

But let us not for one moment lose sight 
of the one fact, made so prominent in 
God's Word, that all of God's provisions 
for future blessing are in and through the 
terms and conditions of the New Covenant, 
which contains no hope, or blessing, 
or provision, for any who love unrighteousness, 



when they see its character 
and results fully. Its provisions are all 
and only for the friends of God, the lovers 
of righteousness. No provision is 
made for the everlasting life of wilful 
sinners, but, as it is written: "He that 
believeth into the Son hath life [Provision 
has been made through Christ, whereby all 
such shall, by resurrection, attain to perfect 
LIFE. At present, like all other New Covenant 
favors, this LIFE is possessed by 
faith and hope only;— it is hid with 
Christ in God.- Rom. 8:24 ; Gal. 2:20 ; 
Col. 3:3 ]; but he that disobeyeth the 
Son [when he and the New Covenant are 
made fully known— 1 Tim. 2:4 ; Isa. 11:9 ; 
Acts 3:22,23 ] shall not see LIFE; 
but the wrath of God abideth on him."— 

1 John 3:36 . 

All that are in their graves shall come 
forth to consciousness, to a measure of 
life as at present (which, however, is really 
a dying condition); but none shall ever 
see LIFE, in the true, proper, full sense of 
the term, except upon hearty compliance 
with all the conditions of the New Covenant. 
Thus the friends of God, the lovers 
of righteousness, will be manifested and 
raised up, while all others shall be cut 
off in the second death, without ever having 
really and fully experienced perfect 
life;— having, however, possessed and 
understood and wilfully rejected the conditions 
upon which they might have attained 
to that life. 

"The wrath of God," his condemnation 
to extinction, will abide or continue upon 
all who, when fully aware of its blessed 
provisions, reject the New Covenant conditions 
of reconciliation with him. As 
already shown, it was not for such that 
the Lord provided redemption and salvation; 
and had divine wisdom, seeing the 
hearts of men, foreseen that all would reject 
the New Covenant opportunity for 
reconciliation, we cannot doubt that no 
such covenant of salvation would have 
been provided; on the contrary, infinite 
wisdom and love would long ago have 
blotted out the race as a brood of vipers. 
The New Covenant is the city of refuge 
to which all who hate their sins and who 
would escape the avenging sword of justice 
may flee and be saved from destruction. 
We who are under its protection 
can sing of our deliverance, "We have 



escaped the condemnation that is on the 
world." Many, very many more, thank 
God, will similarly escape by coming within 
the gates of the same covenant— under 
the influence and control of the great 
Mediator of that New Covenant who 
bridged the chasm of condemnation and 
opened the way into it, at the cost of the 
sacrifice of himself. But whoever, knowing 
all, shall refuse and neglect to come 
under this refuge provided, continues in 
condemnation still; is still under the 
wrath of God; still deserves the wages of 
sin— death, extinction. 

We have heretofore shown that the 
"little flock" of the Gospel age is to 
constitute the First Resurrection, i.e., 
the chief or choice resurrection; it is thus 
designated, because it is to be not only a 

raising up to perfect life but to perfect 
life on a higher plane or nature— to the 
divine instead of the human nature. For 
the same reason the Apostle Paul calls it 
the out-resurrection (exanastasis), or the 
resurrection of the selected-out ones. 
(See Phil. 3:11 .) However, the word 
first is appropriate also as describing the 
order; for the resurrection of the "little 
flock" comes first in order, too. It began 
with Christ the head— it will be finished 
at his second advent in the perfecting of 
"the church, which is his body." 

We have seen, too, that in the past 
ages some valiantly overcame obstacles, 
and would not compromise their conscience 
to procure deliverance, that they 
might obtain a better, more favorable, 
resurrection. ( Heb. 11:35 .) And we 
have seen, too, that the "better" or favorable 
feature of their resurrection (though 
they will not have part in the First Resurrection, 
which will include none but the 
Bride, the Lamb's wife, whose call and 
selection did not begin until our Lord 
came to redeem and to call them) consists 
in the fact that they will not be obliged 
to come to perfection slowly, step by step 
during the Millennial age of trial. Their 
trial was completed under severely trying 
conditions; and this is evident, for "they 
had this testimony, that they pleased God 
and that God is not ashamed to be called 

their God." Hence they, like the Gospel 
age little flock, are counted as having 
passed from condemnation to death into 
justification of life. And when God's 



due time shall come, both of these classes 
will get the reward of Life— perfect life — 
instantly; though not in the same instant, 
because the Gospel church as the body of 
Christ will have precedence, "God having 
provided a still better thing [a still 

R1180 : page 6 

better resurrection] for us, that they without 
us should not be made perfect."— 
Heb. 11:40. 

They who see clearly how the justified 
ones of the Gospel age, the "Bride," and 
the justified ones of the preceding time, 

R1180 : page 7 

whom the Christ shall "make princes 

[rulers] in all the earth," are to have each 

a resurrection to LIFE [the one to spiritual 

and the other to human perfection], can 

see, as no others can see, the meaning of 

the Prophet's words ( Dan. 12:2 ) that 

some shall awake to everlasting Life and 

some awake still in the same condition of 

condemnation, imperfection and shame, 

in which they fell asleep in death. Some 

(two small classes) will come forth already 

acquitted, justified to life; while 

the many who will come up to perfection, 

will come during the age of trial 

and be of the resurrection of trial or resurrection 

of condemnation. And some— 

we have every reason to believe they will 

be few— shall never come up to life at 

all, shall never escape the condemnation 

or "wrath," and "shall not see LIFE;" 

because of wilful, intelligent opposition 

to God. Such adversaries of God and 

of righteousness are called the servants 

[angels] of Satan ( Matt. 25:41 ), the 

children of the devil ( 1 John 3:10 ), and 

such like names, because they pattern after 

his character and partake willingly of his 

spirit. And such shall be destroyed with 

Satan in the second death, symbolized by 

the lake of fire. ( Matt. 25:41 ; Rev. 20:14 .) 

And this their punishment (extinction 

in second death) is to be an everlasting 

punishment. There will be no 

ransom and restitution from the second 

death, because it will be inflicted only upon 

the wilfully evil, who first will have had 

and rejected all the abundant opportunity 

of reconciliation afforded by the New 



Covenant. The rewards and punishments 
at the close of the Millennial age are, 
both, final and everlasting. The one class 
the Judge decides to be worthy of life 
everlasting and the other worthy of death 
everlasting— extinction.— Matt. 25:46 . 

So, also, is the statement that there 
shall be a resurrection of both the just 
and the unjust. The just are those of the 
Gospel age and of the preceding times 
who are justified to life and rise perfect, 
in "the resurrection of the just." The 
resurrection (raising up, up to perfection) 
of the unjust should not be understood to 
mean that unjust persons will reach perfection 
(for the Lord's words, and the 
New Covenant's conditions, forbid the 
thought that any except the just shall ever 
see LIFE); but should be understood to 
mean that not only the few, who now 
through faith and obedience are recognized 
by God as the just, but others, 
many others, now unjust, shall have the 
opportunity of being lifted up to perfection. 
And, indeed, it might be said, truly, 
that any who have the means or opportunity 
of resurrection placed within 
their grasp, really receive a resurrection. 

The Apostle Peter expressed a general 
truth when he said: "Of a truth I perceive 
that God is no respecter of persons; 
but in every nation he that feareth him 
and worketh righteousness is accepted of 
him." ( Acts 10:34 .) Of a truth we 
see, too, that all not of this character described 
will be rejected. But, as God for 
a time recognized only Israel, his typically 
holy people, and left others unrecognized, 
treating them as strangers and aliens until 
the Gospel age opened a door of favors to 
the few who have ears to hear the present 
call; so there are throughout the world 
to-day millions whom God regards as his 
"friends," though he has not yet revealed 
himself and his plan of salvation, under 
the New Covenant, to them. These, as 
yet, are blinded by Satan with false representations 
of God's character and plan 
and often deluded as to what is right and 
what is wrong, and are thus hindered 
now by weaknesses within and by errors 
without. They reverence the Creator 
and ignorantly worship him, and prefer 
and make some effort for righteousness, 
as far as they can appreciate it. These 
all, of every age, among them such noble, 



shining heathen lights as Aristotle, Plato, 
Confucius and others, are the "sheep" 
whom our Lord came to seek and to save; 
such are the "friends" for whom he laid 
down his life; such are "his people" 
whom he came to save from their sins 
(John 10:16; 15:13,14; Matt. 1:21 ); 
though as yet the vast majority know not 
of the Redeemer or the precious ransom-price 
he gave or of the gracious conditions 
of the New Covenant sealed and 
ratified by his blood. 

Nor can even such "friends" ever be 
saved, ever reach everlasting life, except 
under the conditions of that New Covenant 
—faith and obedience. That is God's 
way and his only way. Therefore, the 
Millennial age is appointed to be the period 
in which these who constitute the vast 
majority of God's "friends" shall be 
raised to perfection; and it is called the 
resurrection of the [now] unjustified, because 
they are as yet unbelievers who have 
not yet come to a sufficiency of knowledge. 
How could they become believers 
without hearing of Christ— without a full, 
clear understanding of God's character 
and plan and covenant? And how 
could such as have fallen into the Adamic 
sleep come to a knowledge of the truth 
( Eccl. 9:10 ) without being awakened? 
Therefore it is appointed of God that all 
that are in their graves shall hear the 
summons of the Son of man and come 
forth. And the ransom and its precious 
opportunities for reconciliation shall be 
testified to all; all shall come to an accurate 
knowledge of the Truth; the blinded 
eyes shall be opened and the deaf ears 
shall be unstopped; "and they that hear 
[obey] shall LIVE," and the soul that shall 
not hear [obey] that Teacher shall be cut 
off from among his people, shall die the 
second death.— 1 Tim. 2:4,6 ; Isa. 35:5 ; 
John 5:25 ; Acts 3:23 . 

The fact that the New Covenant is spoken 
of as being made only with God's 
people has confused many; because (1) 
they have failed to note that God recognizes 
as "his people" all who fear him 
and work righteousness, including all who 
under fuller light than they now have 
would do so; and because (2) in reading 
the Old Testament prophecies, which 
promise the New Covenant, they apply 
all its promises to the Jews or to the Gospel 



church, or to both of these exclusively; 
and failing to see the true lengths and 
breadths of the expression, "God's people," 
fail also to see that Israel and its 
Covenant were largely typical of the New 
Covenant and the millions on millions, 
who shall ultimately come unto God 
under its provisions, more ample than 
that of the Jewish Covenant, and under 
its Mediator, more powerful than Moses, 
and able to save to the uttermost all 
that come unto God by him. In order 
that they may come, all shall be called, 
"all shall hear his voice." In order that 
they may come, he "will draw all;" all 
shall be drawn by the fullest, clearest 
presentation of the truth. Yet "if any 
man [thus drawn] draw back, my soul 
shall have no pleasure in him;" the soul 
[being] that will not hear [obey] that 
Teacher shall be cut off as unworthy of 
LIFE. But all such as hear and come to 
an appreciation of the truth and love it 
and enter a covenant of obedience then, 
shall sing, with spirit and with the understanding 
also, as we do now— 

"He drew me and I followed on, 
Charmed to confess the voice divine." 
Hallelujah! What a Savior! And what 
a grand, glorious, comprehensive and yet 
exclusive salvation he is working out: 
comprehensive in that none are debarred 
from its privileges in any sense or degree; 
exclusive in that it will exclude all that 
would tend to mar true joy and pleasure 
and will admit only such as will possess 
the mental and moral likeness of God— 
his people, his children. Verily, God 
will "call those his people who were not 
his people, and her beloved who was not 
beloved." Israel not only represented 
the beloved, the true Bride, the "little 
flock," the "royal priesthood," in her 
typical priesthood, but also represented 
typically all of God's people as they shall 
all yet be blessed under the grand antitypical 
priesthood of Christ and the Gospel 
church, who not only render "better 
sacrifices, but by and by shall be established 
as a kingdom of priests after the 
order of Melchizedeck. But as the sacrifices 
for sin under Israel's covenant and 
by her High Priest were for Israel only, 
and yet only typical of the true High 
Priest's mediatorial sacrifice of atonement, 
for the sins of the whole world, so it is 



evident that the New Covenant ratified 
by his blood [death] applies not to Israel 
only but to all whom Israel represented, 
viz., all who ever shall become God's 
covenant people under the New Covenant. 

How grievously, then, they err who 
misunderstand us to teach that the just 
and the unjust, the holy and the evil 
disposed, shall be compelled to keep each 
other's distasteful company throughout 
eternity. Above we have shown that 
God's plan is to give eternal life to none 
but the righteous, but that he has made 
the most abundant provision, through 
Christ and the New Covenant, for all to 
become righteous. 

And how foolish and unscriptural is the 
view of those ("orthodox"?) Christian 
friends, who, stumbling over the New 
Covenant, narrowly see only the selection 
of the present (really only a work preliminary 
to the coming work of blessing). 
This leads some on the one hand to so 
narrow down their ideas of the provisions 
of the New Covenant that they see only 
the very few saints of the present time 
blessed under it, and the masses entirely 
ignored and not even brought to a knowledge 
of its provisions that they might accept 
or reject them. And it leads others to 
the other extreme, of holding that all the 
ignorant heathen, and the "so-so" majority 
of mankind (including all except 
the foulest murderers, and even such of 
them as shall breathe a prayer for mercy 
before they die), will all, though still 
morally filthy, untaught of God, undisciplined 
and untried, be hustled together into 
the society of the Lord, the saints and the 
holy angels, to constitute the family of 
God. Surely, sane Christian people who 
have no love for such companionship now 
can only picture it for the future from two 
causes: (1) their false ideas of the divine 

R1181 : page 7 

plan, which they suppose has provided 
only heaven or eternal torture for all at 
the close of the present life, and (2) 
they are too generous of heart to consign 
the vast majority, or any but the 
vilest of the vile, to such a penalty as 
eternal torment, and would rather spend a 
portion of eternity in such uncongenial 
society and trust to improving them, than 



to think of their agonies. Such generous 
souls should learn the way of the Lord 
more perfectly. They should see that 
their plan of saving the masses is, to say 
the least, very crude and imperfect. They 
should see that their view of results would 
make it appear that the New Covenant is 
really a compromise with sin on God's 
part, instead of an arrangement by which 
sinners might be saved from their sins and 
brought into harmony with God and to 
perfection. It would be strange, indeed, 
if divine wisdom could not devise a better 
plan. 

On the other hand, our views of the 
divine plan should not be confounded 
with those of Universalists, which represent 
God as so unjustly weak and loving 
that he cannot execute the laws of his 
kingdom; or so untruthful as to have declared 
a falsehood, which he never meant 
to execute, when he said, "The soul that 
sinneth, it shall die." What wonder, if 
these find no place for the New Covenant 
and no use for "the blood of the New 
Covenant," nor for "the Mediator of the 
Covenant," in their theory touching the 
World's Hope. 

Their hope, built upon the assumed 
weakness of God's character and his inability 
to execute the penalty he prescribed 
against sin, or upon his change of mind, 
or his deception of mankind in naming a 
penalty which he never intended to execute 
against any, is surely a hope built 
upon a sandy foundation and not upon 
the rock foundation of the New Covenant, 
sealed with the precious blood. 

Neither should the views we present 
be confounded with the views of what we 
might term Irresponsible -Universalism, 
which claims that man has no responsibility, 
and merely acts and thinks as acted 
upon by divine power and providence, 
which places the responsibility for sin all 
upon God, and which, consistently with 
that false premise, holds that a ransom for 
man's sin, and a New Covenant based 
upon it, would be but a farce; since, if 
man is not responsible for sin, he needed 
no atonement to be made for him, and 
since God caused the sin, he alone is responsible 
and is bound by his own justice 
to release all men from the penalties of 
sin (which, according to their view, are 
undeserved) and bring all to everlasting 



life and joy. 

This view is a shamefully weak, unreasonable 
and unjust one. It is a calumny 
upon man as well as a blasphemy 
against the great Creator. It is a calumny 
upon men in that it represents them as so 
many living machines without will for evil 
or for good; which, therefore, no amount 
of experience could either benefit or injure; 
and which would be as unworthy of 
reward for right-doing as undeserving of 
punishment for evil-doing. It is a blasphemy 
against God in that it represents 
him as using his power for evil. Worse 
than that, it represents him as using his 
power to produce an unmitigated evil, in 
bringing sin, pain and death upon a creature 
which, it claims, was not only not 
responsible, but by nature incapable of 
being in any way benefited or exercised 
by the evil; having no will of his own to 
be exercised, but being merely a tool, and 
a toy, in the hands of the Creator. And, 
still worse, this view would make it appear 
that, after doing all these great wrongs 
to man, God had added insult to injury 
by charging his own sin to the man, and 
calling man a sinner when he was not; 
and providing typical sacrifices for sin 
first and then pretending to love the sinners 
so as to give his Son to be their Redeemer, 
making a farce of the death of 
Christ and keeping up the delusion and 
deception through the apostles and the 
Gospel church since, until some of these 
wise men found out the fraud God was 
perpetrating, and exposed him— calling 
the exposition The Spirit of the Word. 

The spirit of a very unsound reason, 
much rather, are such teachings. The 
spirit of a heart going about to establish 

R1181 : page 8 

its own uprightness and sinlessness at the 
expense of slandering the character of 
the great Creator. The spirit of a man 
who is seeking hopelessly, vainly, for a 
firm footing upon his own reasonings, and 
who has not submitted his reasonings to 
the divine testimony. We have no use 
for such a spirit: it is not worthy even 
to be called the spirit of the world; for 
that is more true, more noble, more 
reasonable. 
But the weakness of this latter, irrational, 



"Irresponsible-Universalism" is shown 
in its claim, that God will save all men, 
eternally, because his justice demands that 
his wrong against man shall be righted. 
The reasoning, here, is on a par with the 
rest; it is unreasonable nonsense to claim 
that justice would demand anything or be 
a moving consideration at all in such a 
being as this theory would make out God 
to be. If so unjust as to perpetrate all 
this wrong for six thousand years, there 
certainly is no ground for any faith in his 
justice. If he has lied and deceived in 
the past, as this theory would imply, there 
could be no better reason asked for rejecting 
and disbelieving any and all promises 
for the future. This theory builds upon the 
shifting sands of human speculation only 
(and very poor sand even), and not upon 
the New Covenant, sealed with the precious 
blood of Christ. 

On the contrary, the view we here present 
is harmonious; it is consistent with 
reason and with all that God has revealed 
of his own character. It recognizes man's 
responsibility for his own will. It recognizes 
God's justice and man's guilt. It 
does not excuse sin but applies God's 
remedy for its healing. It does not offer 
to heal wilful sinners, but repentant ones. 
It does not heal ignorant ones, because 
of ignorance, nor wiser ones on account 
of knowledge, but provides that all must 
come to a clear, full knowledge of the 
truth, and that then, only such as fully 
and heartily accept of Christ's atoning 
work, and make use of it, to obtain access 
to God, and restoration to harmony 
with him, and shall prove themselves willingly 
so, under a trial, shall ever see LIFE 
in its fulness, or go beyond the Millennial 
age to enter the portals of that blessed 
eternity beyond, which God hath provided 
only for those who love him.

RESTITUTION PROGRESSING. 

We have heretofore called attention to 
the great improvement of late years in 
the climate of Palestine from the increase 
of rain-falls and the consequent increased 
productiveness of its soil; and we have 



remarked that similar and other changes 
will be in order gradually throughout the 
earth to fit and prepare it for the Millennial 
reign of Christ and for the support 
of the millions of the dead as they shall 
be gradually awakened, "every man in 
his own order." 

Below we print a clipping which bears 
pointedly upon this subject, and shows 
that, as we have anticipated, some features 
of the restitution will glide in very 
imperceptibly. 

"A paper called The Iron comes forward 
with the remark that what were supposed 
to be deserts are rapidly vanishing 
before the advance of civilization. There 
was a time when the United States had 
one of no small size, when it was considered 
that all the land west of the Missouri 
River was a barren waste. The farmers 
of Kansas, Nebraska and Dakota have 
disposed of much of the great American 
Desert. Once upon a time large portions 
of the interior of Africa were believed to 
be arid and uncultivable. Now we learn 
that they are fruitful and well populated. 
The interior of Australia has been held 
up as an awful example of a howling wilderness, 
destitute of water and of animal 
or vegetable life. That illusion is now 
being rapidly dispelled. Recent explorers 
report that inner Australia is no Saharan 
waste, and that, though uninhabited, it 
can support a large population. There 
are grassy plains, large lakes, and also 
traces of gold and precious stones. A 
north and south railway is now being made 
through the center of Australia, and doubtless 
with its completion the last trace of 
desert will vanish. The iron horse is a 
wonderful dispeller of illusions of that 
kind. The truth is that there are vast 
regions in America, Asia and Australia, 
which are barren from the standpoint of 
primitive and ignorant agriculture, but 
which when taken in hand by the educated 
farmer of the present day, with his implements, 
develop into fertile fields and 
pastures." 

And as with the natural changes, so 
with many of the moral and political reforms 
also: Many of these are coming in 

R1174 : page 8 

gradually. It would be a mistake, however, 



to expect that all would glide in 
smoothly. The words of the Lord and 
the apostles and the prophets most clearly 
indicate that the progress of nature's new 
birth will be marked by grievous spasms 
and throes in the old order of things,— 
cloudbursts, storms, earthquakes, etc., in 
nature, in politics, in religion, in everything. 
All the selfish and evil arrangements 
of the present shall be thoroughly 
shaken out, so that nothing but good shall 
remain.- Heb. 12:26-29 ; Jas. 5:1-8 .

A RAILWAY TO JERUSALEM. 

"The British Consular Agent at Jaffa, 
in the last report of the trade of his district, 
states that a concession for a railway 
from Jaffa to Jerusalem has been 
granted by the Sultan to Mr. Joseph Navon, 
an Ottoman subject, for 71 years. It 
is stated that a company has been formed 
in England and France to carry out the 
scheme, and that the engineers are soon 
expected to undertake the work. The 
carriage road between Jaffa and Jerusalem 
has been greatly improved. The Government 
sold last year the income from the 
toll of the road for L. 2,085, as compared 
with L. 1,8 12 the year before last, which 
shows an increase in the traffic. The Jewish 
colonies in Palestine are greatly improving; 
one of them, which is called 
Richon le Zion, has planted about 2,000,000 
vines, and is promising well. The colonists 
are good laborers, nearly all their 
land is cultivated. The greater part of 
them are Turkish subjects, and all are 
subject to the laws of the country."— Sel.
