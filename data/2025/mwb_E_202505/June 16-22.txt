8. Helping Loved Ones Draw Close to Jehovah “Without a Word”


(15 min.) Discussion.

Many of us know someone who is not presently serving Jehovah​—perhaps our marriage mate, our child, or a dear friend who has strayed from the congregation. Have you ever caught yourself being overly forceful or even blunt in an attempt to persuade him to serve Jehovah? Though our motives are good, our words could actually make things worse. (Pr 12:18) What would be a better approach?
First Peter 3:1 explains that an unbelieving husband “may be won without a word.” Even if a Christian sister’s husband refuses to discuss Bible truths with her, she may still be able to help him come to know Jehovah. Her conduct, which has been molded by such godly qualities as love, kindness, and wisdom, may soften his heart. (Pr 16:23) Our conduct and graciousness can have a good effect on loved ones who do not currently serve Jehovah.​—“Gracious” study note on Col 4:6, nwtsty.
