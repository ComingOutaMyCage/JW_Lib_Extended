7. Encourage Others to Try Our Bible Course


(5 min.) Discussion.

Offering Bible studies is an important part of our ministry. After all, how can we help people to become disciples if we do not study the Bible with them? (Ro 10:13-15) Why not make it a goal to use the direct approach regularly in the door-to-door work? First, try to determine what topic the householder might be interested in. Then, demonstrate how a Bible study can answer his questions and help him in practical ways.
