7. Cultivate Habits That Promote Good Communication


(15 min.) Discussion.

Good communication is key to a happy family life. When family members communicate openly, they can accomplish goals as a team and support one another during challenging times. (Pr 15:22) What can you do to promote open communication in your family?
Spend time together. (De 6:6, 7) When families work together, participate in spiritual activities together, and have fun together, they create a strong bond of love and trust. They also create opportunities for relaxed conversation. At times, you may need to sacrifice your personal preferences to do something that others in the family want to do, but the long-term rewards are worth it! (Php 2:3, 4) How can you make the best use of your time together?​—Eph 5:15, 16.

  What else did you learn about effective communication from this video?

Your answer




Be a good listener. (Jas 1:19) Children are more likely to express themselves freely if they are not afraid of being misunderstood or judged. So do your best not to overreact if your child says something that concerns you. (Pr 17:27) Instead, listen with empathy. Try to understand his thoughts and feelings so that you can reassure or assist him in a loving way.
