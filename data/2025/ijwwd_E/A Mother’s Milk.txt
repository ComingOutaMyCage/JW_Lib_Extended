WAS IT DESIGNED?
A Mother’s Milk


“Infant formula milk will never completely mimic human milk,” states a reference book for midwives. One of the reasons a mother’s milk is ideal for her baby is because her body changes it in a way that matches an infant’s needs.
Consider: Mother’s milk changes from the beginning to the end of each feeding session. The milk at the beginning of a feeding has more protein, vitamins, minerals, and water, whereas the milk later in the feeding has more fat, leaving the infant satisfied. Her milk even changes based on the baby’s age and the season.
In mother’s milk, the amount of some hormones, such as melatonin, peaks during the night, whereas other hormones peak during the day. Depending on the time of day, these hormonal variations promote sleepiness or alertness, which help the infant establish a sleep/wake cycle.
During the first few days after giving birth, the mother produces a yellowish milk called colostrum. Colostrum is easy to digest and is concentrated with nutrients, so even a little in the infant’s tiny stomach provides major benefits. Colostrum has an abundance of key antibodies that protect the vulnerable infant from infections. In addition, it acts like a laxative, helping to clean out the newborn’s digestive system.
Mothers need not be anxious about having sufficient milk, even with twins, because the supply naturally increases to match the need.
What do you think? Did mother’s milk, with its unique properties, evolve? Or was it designed?
