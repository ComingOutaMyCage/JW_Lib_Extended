<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Anyone who has tried to swat a fly knows how difficult the task can be. With lightning-fast reactions, these insects evade most attempts to catch them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Scientists have discovered that one type of fly, the fruit fly, is able to make turns similar to those made by fighter jets, but in a fraction of a second. At birth, “they can fly like an ace,” says Professor Michael Dickinson. “It’s like putting a newborn baby in the cockpit of a fighter aircraft and it knowing what to do.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Researchers filmed the flies’ aerobatics and found that they flap their wings 200 times per second. Yet, a single wingbeat is sufficient to reorient their bodies and begin an escape.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>And what about response time? Researchers found that these flies can react to a threat 50 times faster than a human can blink. “The fly performs a very sophisticated calculation, in a very short amount of time, to determine where the danger lies and exactly how to bank for the best escape,” explains Dickinson.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Just <em>how</em> the fruit fly’s tiny brain can do this is an engineering mystery that researchers want to solve.</p>
