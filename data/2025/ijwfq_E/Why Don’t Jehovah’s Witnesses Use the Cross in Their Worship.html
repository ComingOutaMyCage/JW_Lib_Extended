<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Many people view the cross as the universal symbol of Christianity. Although Jehovah’s Witnesses are Christians, we do not use the cross in our worship. Why not?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>One reason is that the Bible indicates that <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:502013284/">Jesus did not die on a cross</a> but rather on a simple stake. Moreover, the Bible strongly warns Christians to “flee from idolatry,” which would mean not using the cross in worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:21-62:5:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:​21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Significantly, Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) Jesus thereby indicated that self-sacrificing love​—not the cross or any other image—would identify his true followers.</p>
