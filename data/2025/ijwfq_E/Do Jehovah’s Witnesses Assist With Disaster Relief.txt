Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Assist With Disaster Relief?


Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses often help when disaster strikes. We provide practical relief assistance to both Witnesses and non-Witnesses, in harmony with the Bible’s instruction at Galatians 6:10: “Let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” We also try to give the emotional and spiritual support that victims sorely need at such times.—2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.
Organization
After a disaster, the elders of the congregations in the affected area try to contact all who are associated with those congregations to see if they are safe and to find out what help they might need. The elders then report the results of their survey and initial relief efforts to the local branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
If the need for relief is beyond what the congregations in the area can provide, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses arranges to supply what is needed. This is similar to the way early Christians cared for one another during a time of famine. (1 Corinthians 16:1-4) The local branch office appoints Disaster Relief Committees to organize and direct the effort. Witnesses from other areas volunteer their time and resources to help out.—Proverbs 17:17.
Funding
One of the ways donations sent to the branch offices of Jehovah’s Witnesses are used is to relieve victims of disasters. (Acts 11:27-30; 2 Corinthians 8:13-15) Since the work is performed by unpaid volunteers, the funds that are allocated go toward actual relief, not administrative expenses. We are careful with all donations.—2 Corinthians 8:20.
