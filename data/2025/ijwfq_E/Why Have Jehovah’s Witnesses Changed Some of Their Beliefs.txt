Why Have Jehovah’s Witnesses Changed Some of Their Beliefs?


We have always used the Bible as the sole authority for our beliefs, so we have adjusted our beliefs as our understanding of the Scriptures has been clarified.a
Such changes are in harmony with the Bible principle stated at Proverbs 4:​18: “The path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.” Just as the rising sun reveals details of a landscape gradually, God grants an understanding of divine truth progressively, in his due time. (1 Peter 1:​10-​12) As the Bible foretold, he has accelerated this process during “the time of the end.”​—Daniel 12:4.
These adjustments in our understanding should neither surprise nor disturb us. Ancient worshippers of God also had mistaken ideas and expectations and needed to adjust their viewpoint.
  Moses offered himself as a deliverer for the nation of Israel 40 years ahead of God’s timetable.​—Acts 7:​23-​25, 30, 35.

  The apostles failed to understand the prophecy that foretold the Messiah’s death and resurrection.​—Isaiah 53:​8-​12; Matthew 16:21-​23.

  Some early Christians had wrong ideas about the timing of “the day of Jehovah.”​—2 Thessalonians 2:​1, 2.


God later corrected their misunderstandings, and we pray that he will continue doing the same for us.​—James 1:5.

a We do not try to hide these changes in our understanding of the Bible. In fact, we record and publish them. For example, see the “Beliefs Clarified” entry in the online reference to our publications.
