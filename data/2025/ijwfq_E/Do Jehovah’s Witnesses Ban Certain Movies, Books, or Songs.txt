Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Ban Certain Movies, Books, or Songs?


No. Our organization doesn’t review specific movies, books, or songs so as to rule on what individuals should avoid. Why not?
 The Bible encourages each individual to train his “perceptive powers” to discern right and wrong.—Hebrews 5:14.
 The Scriptures set forth basic principles that a Christian can weigh when selecting entertainment.a As with all areas of life, our goal is to “keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.”​—Ephesians 5:10.
 The Bible teaches that family heads have a measure of authority, so they may choose not to allow certain entertainment among members of their household. (1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 6:1-4) Outside the family, however, no one is authorized to ban specific films, songs, or artists as being unacceptable for Witnesses in general.—Galatians 6:5.

a For example, the Bible condemns anything that promotes spiritism, sexual immorality, or violence.​—Deuteronomy 18:10-13; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:8.
