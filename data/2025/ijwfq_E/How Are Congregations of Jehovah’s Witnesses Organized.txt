How Are Congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses Organized?


A body of elders supervises each congregation. About 20 congregations form a circuit. Congregations receive periodic visits from traveling elders known as circuit overseers.
Bible-based guidance and instructions are provided by a Governing Body made up of longtime Witnesses who currently work at the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Warwick, New York, U.S.A.—Acts 15:23-29; 1 Timothy 3:1-7.
