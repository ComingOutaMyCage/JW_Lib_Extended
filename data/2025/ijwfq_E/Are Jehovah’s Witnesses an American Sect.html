<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  Some define a sect as a group that has broken away from an established religion. Jehovah’s Witnesses have not broken away from some other religious group. Instead, we feel that we have reestablished the form of Christianity that was practiced in the first century.</p>
