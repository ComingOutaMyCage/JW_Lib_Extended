<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. A person can resign from our organization in two ways:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <strong>By formal request.</strong> Either orally or in writing, a person can state his decision that he no longer wants to be known as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>By action.</strong> A person can take an action that places him outside our worldwide brotherhood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:9-60:5:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:9</a>) For example, he might join another religion and make known his intention to remain part of it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:19-62:2:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 2:​19</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>What if a person no longer preaches or attends your meetings? Do you view that person as having resigned?</strong></h2>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>No, we do not. Resigning, or disassociating oneself, is different from becoming weak in faith. Often, those who for a time slow down or stop in their worship have not abandoned their faith but are suffering from discouragement. Rather than <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502012472/">shunning</a> such ones, we try to give them consolation and support. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:​14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:22-65:1:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jude 22</a>) If the person wants help, <a class="xt" data-xtid="73" href="jwpub://p/E:1102012156/">congregation elders</a> take the lead in providing spiritual assistance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Galatians 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:​1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>However, the elders are not authorized to coerce or pressure someone to remain as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Each person makes his own choice regarding religion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 24:15</a>) We believe that those who worship God must do so willingly, from the heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matthew 22:37</a>.</p>
