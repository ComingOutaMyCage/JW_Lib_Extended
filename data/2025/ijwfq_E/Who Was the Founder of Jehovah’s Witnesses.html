<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The modern-day organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses began at the end of the 19th century. At that time, a small group of Bible students who lived near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the United States, began a systematic analysis of the Bible. They compared the doctrines taught by the churches with what the Bible really teaches. They began publishing what they learned in books, newspapers, and the journal that is now called <em>The Watchtower—Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Among that group of sincere Bible students was a man named Charles Taze Russell. While Russell took the lead in the Bible education work at that time and was the first editor of <em>The Watchtower</em>, he was not the founder of a new religion. The goal of Russell and the other Bible Students, as the group was then known, was to promote the teachings of Jesus Christ and to follow the practices of the first-century Christian congregation. Since Jesus is the Founder of Christianity, we view him as the founder of our organization.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:18-51:1:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 1:18-20</a>.</p>
