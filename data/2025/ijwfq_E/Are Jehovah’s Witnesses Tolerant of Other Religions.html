<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>We follow the Bible’s advice to “respect everyone”—regardless of their religious beliefs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:17-60:2:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>, <em>Today’s English Version</em>) For example, in some countries there are hundreds of thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Even so, we don’t try to pressure politicians or lawmakers into restricting or banning the work of other religious groups. Nor do we campaign to have laws passed that would impose our moral and religious convictions on the general community. Instead, we extend to others the same tolerance that we appreciate receiving from them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>.</p>
