</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The first part of the <em>New World Translation</em> was released in 1950. Since then, some people have commented on or questioned the accuracy of the <em>New World Translation</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> because in places it differs from other translations of the Bible. The reasons for these differences usually fall into one of the following categories.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>  Reliability.</strong> The <em>New World Translation</em> is based on up-to-date scholarly research and the most reliable ancient manuscripts. In contrast, the <em>King James Version</em> of 1611 was based on manuscripts that were often less accurate and not as old as those used in producing the <em>New World Translation.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>  Faithfulness.</strong> The <em>New World Translation</em> strives to convey faithfully the original message that was inspired by God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:​16</a>) Many translations of the Bible sacrifice faithfulness to God’s message in favor of following human traditions, for instance by replacing God’s personal name, Jehovah, with titles such as Lord or God.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>  Literalness.</strong> Unlike paraphrased translations, the <em>New World Translation</em> renders words literally as long as doing so does not result in awkward wording or hide the thought of the original writings. Translations that paraphrase the Bible’s original text may insert human opinions or omit important details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Differences between the <em>New World Translation</em> and other translations</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Missing books.</strong> In their Bibles, the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches include books known by some as <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:2010162/">the Apocrypha</a>. However, those books were not accepted into the Jewish canon, and it is noteworthy that the Bible says that the Jews were the ones who were “entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:1-45:3:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 3:​1, 2</a>) Thus, the <em>New World Translation</em> and many other modern Bible translations rightly exclude the books of the Apocrypha.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Missing verses.</strong> Some translations add verses and phrases that are not in the oldest available Bible manuscripts, but the <em>New World Translation</em> excludes such added material. Many modern translations either omit those later additions or acknowledge that those additions lack support from the most authoritative sources.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

</div>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Different wording.</strong> Occasionally, word-for-word translations are unclear or misleading. For example, Jesus’ statement at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a> is often translated: “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” (<em>English Standard Version; King James Version; New International Version</em>) Many find the literal rendering “poor in spirit” to be obscure, while some think that Jesus was highlighting the value of humility or poverty. However, Jesus’ point was that true happiness comes from recognizing the need for God’s guidance. The <em>New World Translation</em> accurately conveys his meaning with the words “those conscious of their spiritual need.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Positive comments about the <em>New World Translation</em> from non-Witness scholars</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  In a letter dated December 8, 1950, noted Bible translator and scholar Edgar J. Goodspeed wrote regarding the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures:</em> “I am interested in the mission work of your people, and its world wide scope, and much pleased with the free, frank and vigorous translation. It exhibits a vast array of sound serious learning, as I can testify.”</p>

<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  Commenting on the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</em> British Bible critic Alexander Thomson wrote: “The translation is evidently the work of skilled and clever scholars, who have sought to bring out as much of the true sense of the Greek text as the English language is capable of expressing.”​<em>—The Differentiator,</em> April 1952, page 52.</p>

<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  Despite noting what he felt were a few unusual renderings, author Charles Francis Potter said: “The anonymous translators have certainly rendered the best manuscript texts, both Greek and Hebrew, with scholarly ability and acumen.”​<em>—The Faiths Men Live By,</em> page 300.</p>

<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  Professor Benjamin Kedar-Kopfstein, a Hebrew scholar in Israel, said in 1989: “In my linguistic research in connection with the Hebrew Bible and translations, I often refer to the English edition of what is known as the <em>New World Translation.</em> In so doing, I find my feeling repeatedly confirmed that this work reflects an honest endeavor to achieve an understanding of the text that is as accurate as possible.”</p>

<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  Based on his analysis of nine major English translations, Jason David BeDuhn, associate professor of religious studies, wrote: “The NW [<em>New World Translation</em>] emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” Although the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the <em>New World Translation</em> are the result of religious bias on the part of its translators, BeDuhn stated: “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.”​<em>—Truth in Translation,</em> pages 163, 165.</p>
