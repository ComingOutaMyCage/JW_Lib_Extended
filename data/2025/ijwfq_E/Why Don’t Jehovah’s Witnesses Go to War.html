</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>For the following reasons, Jehovah’s Witnesses don’t go to war:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>               <strong>Obedience to God.</strong> The Bible says that God’s servants would “beat their swords into plowshares” and not “learn war anymore.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>               <strong>Obedience to Jesus.</strong> The apostle Peter was told by Jesus: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:52-40:26:52" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 26:52</a>) Jesus thus showed that his followers would not take up weapons of warfare.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Jesus’ disciples obey his command to be “no part of the world” by remaining strictly neutral in political matters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) They do not protest against military actions or interfere with those who choose to serve in the armed forces.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>               <strong>Love for others.</strong> Jesus commanded his disciples to “love one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) They would thus form an international brotherhood in which no one would ever wage war against his brother or sister.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:10-62:3:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 3:10-12</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>                   <strong>The example of early Christians.</strong> The <em>Encyclopedia of Religion and War</em> states: “The earliest followers of Jesus rejected war and military service,” recognizing those practices as “incompatible with the love ethic of Jesus and the injunction to love one’s enemies.” Likewise, German theologian Peter Meinhold said of those early disciples of Jesus: “Being a Christian and a soldier was considered irreconcilable.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Contributions to the community</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses are useful members of society and pose no threat to the security of the countries where they live. We respect governmental authority, in harmony with these Bible commands:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>            “Be in subjection to the superior authorities.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 13:1</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>            “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:21-40:22:21" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 22:21</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Thus, we obey the law, pay our taxes, and cooperate with the government’s efforts to provide for the public welfare.</p>
