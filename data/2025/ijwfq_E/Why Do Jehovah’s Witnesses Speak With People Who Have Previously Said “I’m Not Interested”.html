<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses, motivated by love for God and love of neighbor, enjoy sharing the Bible’s message with all people, including those who have previously said “I’m not interested.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-​39</a>) Love for God moves us to obey his Son’s command “to give a thorough witness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 10:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) To do this, we bring God’s message more than once, just as God’s ancient prophets did. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:4-24:25:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:4</a>) Because we love our neighbors, we try to share the lifesaving “good news of the Kingdom” with all, including those who at first were not interested in it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>We often find interest when we return to homes where we found no interest before. Consider three reasons:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  People move.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Others in the home show interest in our message.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  People change. World events or personal circumstances cause some to become more “conscious of their spiritual need” and to take an interest in the Bible’s message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) Even those who are opposed can have a change of heart, as did the apostle Paul.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:13-54:1:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:​13</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Nevertheless, we do not force our message on anyone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:​15</a>) We believe that each person must make his own decision in the matter of worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19, 20</a>.</p>
