Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Do Missionary Work?


Yes. Wherever we live, all of Jehovah’s Witnesses try to have a missionary attitude, or spirit, regularly sharing our faith with people we meet.​—Matthew 28:19, 20.
In addition, some Witnesses visit or move to areas in their own land where a number of people have yet to hear the good news from the Bible. Other Witnesses move to foreign lands in order to expand their ministry. They are happy to have a share in fulfilling the prophecy given by Jesus: “You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth.”​—Acts 1:8.
In 1943, we established a school to provide specialized training for some of our missionaries. Since that time, more than 8,000 Witnesses have attended this school, known as the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.
