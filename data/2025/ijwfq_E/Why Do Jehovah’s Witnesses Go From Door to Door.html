<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jesus told his followers to “make disciples of people of all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) When he sent out his early disciples, Jesus directed them to go to the homes of the people.
