Am I Expected to Become One of Jehovah’s Witnesses if I Study the Bible With Them?


No, you are not obligated in any way. Millions enjoy our Bible study program without becoming Jehovah’s Witnesses.a The purpose of the program is to show you what the Bible teaches. What you decide to do with that knowledge is up to you. We recognize that faith is a personal matter.​—Joshua 24:15.
Can I use my own Bible during the study?
Yes. Although we enjoy using the modern-language New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures and will give you a copy free of charge if you would like to have one, we would be happy for you to use your own Bible. You can learn about the Bible’s message of hope and salvation from nearly any translation.
Why do you study with people who don’t join your faith?
  Our primary motive is love for Jehovah God, who wants Christians to teach others what they have learned. (Matthew 22:37, 38; 28:19, 20) We feel that there is no greater privilege than to be “God’s fellow workers” in helping people to learn what his Word teaches.​—1 Corinthians 3:​6-9.

  We are also motivated by love for our neighbors. (Matthew 22:39) We find joy in sharing with others the wonderful things we have learned.​—Acts 20:35.



a Showing the scope of our study program, during 2023 we conducted 7,281,212 Bible studies each month, many of these with several people at once. Yet only 269,517 people were baptized as Jehovah’s Witnesses that year.
