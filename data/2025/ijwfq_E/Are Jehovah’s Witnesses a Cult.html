<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No, Jehovah’s Witnesses are not a cult. Rather, we are Christians who do our best to follow the example set by Jesus Christ and to live by his teachings.</p>
<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>What is a cult?</strong></h2>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The term “cult” means different things to different people. However, consider two common perceptions regarding cults and why those perceptions don’t apply to us.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Some think of a cult as being a new or unorthodox religion.</strong> Jehovah’s Witnesses have not invented a new religion. On the contrary, we pattern our worship after that of the first-century Christians, whose example and teachings were recorded in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:​16, 17</a>) We believe that the Holy Scriptures should be the authority on what is orthodox in matters of worship.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Some think of a cult as being a dangerous religious sect with a human leader.</strong> Jehovah’s Witnesses do not look to any human as their leader. Rather, we adhere to the standard that Jesus set for his followers when he stated: “Your Leader is one, the Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 23:10</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Far from being a dangerous cult, Jehovah’s Witnesses practice a religion that benefits themselves and others in the community. For example, our ministry has helped many people to <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:2012732/">overcome harmful addictions</a>, such as the abuse of drugs and alcohol. In addition, we conduct literacy classes around the world, helping thousands <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:502013110/">learn to read and write</a>. And we are actively involved in <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:502013256/">disaster relief</a>. We work hard to have a positive impact on others, just as Jesus commanded his followers to do.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:13-40:5:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:​13-​16</a>.</p>
