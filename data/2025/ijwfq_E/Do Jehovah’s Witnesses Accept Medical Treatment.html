<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses accept medicine and medical treatment. While we try to take care of our bodies and maintain good health, we sometimes “need a doctor.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:31-42:5:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 5:31</a>, <em>Easy-to-Read Version</em>) In fact, as was the first-century Christian Luke, some of Jehovah’s Witnesses are physicians.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:14-51:4:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 4:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Some treatments conflict with Bible principles, though, and we reject these. For example, we don’t accept blood transfusions because the <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:502013147/">Bible forbids taking in blood</a> to sustain the body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:20-44:15:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 15:20</a>) Likewise, the Bible prohibits health treatments or procedures that include occult practices.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>However, the vast majority of medical treatments do not conflict with Bible principles. Therefore, personal choice is involved. One Witness might decide to accept a particular medicine or treatment, while another Witness might reject that same treatment.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>.</p>
