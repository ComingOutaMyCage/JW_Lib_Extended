</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>We adhere strictly to the Bible in our observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, which is also known as “the Lord’s supper,” the Last Supper, and the Memorial of Jesus’ death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:20-46:11:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>; <em>King James Version</em>) In contrast, many beliefs and practices of other denominations in connection with this observance are not based on the Bible.</p>
<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The purpose of the Lord’s Evening Meal is to remember Jesus, showing our gratitude for his sacrifice in our behalf. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:24-46:11:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 11:24</a>) The observance is not a sacrament, or a religious practice that imparts merit such as grace or the forgiveness of sins.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The Bible teaches that our sins can be forgiven, not by a religious rite, but only through faith in Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:25-45:3:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 3:​25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:​1, 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>How often?</strong></h2>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Jesus commanded his disciples to commemorate the Lord’s Evening Meal, but he did not specifically say how often. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) Some feel that it should be observed monthly, while others observe it weekly, daily, several times each day, or as often as a person feels is appropriate.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> However, here are some factors that should be considered.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Jesus instituted the Lord’s Evening Meal on the date of the Jewish Passover, and he died later that same day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:1-40:26:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 26:​1, 2</a>) This was no coincidence. The Scriptures compare Jesus’ sacrifice to that of the Passover lamb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:7-46:5:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:​7, 8</a>) The Passover was observed once each year. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:1-2:12:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 12:​1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:5-3:23:5" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Leviticus 23:5</a>) Likewise, the Memorial of Jesus’ death was observed once each year by the early Christians,<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> and Jehovah’s Witnesses follow that Bible-based pattern.</p>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Date and time</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The pattern established by Jesus helps determine not only the frequency but also the date and time of the Memorial. He introduced the observance after sundown on Nisan 14, 33 C.E., according to the Bible’s lunar calendar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:18-40:26:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 26:18-​20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:26" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26</a>) We continue to observe the Memorial on this date each year, following the practice of early Christians.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Although Nisan 14, 33 C.E. was a Friday, the anniversary of that date might fall on a different day of the week each year. We determine the date that Nisan 14 falls each year using the same method as was used in the time of Jesus, rather than applying the method used for the modern Jewish calendar.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span id="footnotesource5" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span></p>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Bread and wine</strong></h2>
<div id="f2" class="east_left half">
<figure>
<img src="img/502015257_univ_cnt_1.jpg" alt="Unleavened bread and red wine" width="900" height="900" class="east_left half" />
</figure>
</div>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>For the new observance, Jesus used unleavened bread and red wine that were left over from the Passover meal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26-​28</a>) Following his example, we use bread without leaven or added ingredients and plain red wine, not grape juice or wine that has been sweetened, fortified, or spiced.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Some denominations use bread with leavening or yeast, but leaven is often used in the Bible as a symbol of sin and corruption. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:1-42:12:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:5:6-46:5:8" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 5:​6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:7-48:5:9" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Galatians 5:​7-9</a>) Thus, only bread free from leaven and other additives can be a fitting symbol for Christ’s sinless body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:22-60:2:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:​22</a>) Another practice not supported by the Bible is that of substituting unfermented grape juice for wine. Some churches do so because of their unscriptural prohibition against consuming alcohol.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:​23</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Emblems, not literal flesh and blood</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The unleavened bread and red wine served at the Memorial are emblems, or symbols, of Christ’s flesh and blood. They are not miraculously changed into or mixed with his literal flesh and blood, as some feel. Consider the Scriptural basis for this understanding.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  If Jesus had commanded his disciples to drink his blood, he would have been telling them to break God’s law against consuming blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:4-1:9:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 9:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 15:28, 29</a>) Yet this could not be, for Jesus would never instruct others to violate God’s law regarding the <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:502013147/">sacredness of blood</a>.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:29" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 8:​28, 29</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  If the apostles had been literally drinking Jesus’ blood, he would not have said that his blood <em>“is to be</em> poured out,” indicating that his sacrifice was yet to occur.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 26:28</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  Jesus’ sacrifice took place “once for all time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:25-58:9:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:​25, 26</a>) However, if the bread and wine were changed into his flesh and blood during the Lord’s Evening Meal, then those partaking would be repeating that sacrifice.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  Jesus said: “Keep doing this in <em>remembrance</em> of me,” not “in <em>sacrifice</em> of me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:24-46:11:24" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Those who believe in transubstantiation, that the bread and wine become Jesus’ literal body and blood, base this doctrine on the wording of certain Bible verses. For example, in many Bible translations, Jesus is recorded as saying of the wine: “This <em>is</em> my blood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:28-40:26:28" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 26:28</a>) However, Jesus’ words can also be translated as: “This <em>means</em> my blood,” “This <em>represents</em> my blood,” or “This <em>signifies</em> my blood.”<span data-fnid="6" class="fn">f<span id="footnotesource6" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="6"></span></span> As he had often done, Jesus was teaching by using a metaphor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:34-40:13:35" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>Who partake?</strong></h2>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>When Jehovah’s Witnesses observe the Lord’s Evening Meal, only a small fraction of us partake of the bread and wine. Why is that so?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>Jesus’ shed blood established “a new covenant” that replaced the covenant between Jehovah God and the ancient nation of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:10-58:8:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 8:​10-​13</a>) Those who are in that new covenant partake of the Memorial emblems. It includes, not all Christians, but only “those who have been called” in a special way by God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:15-58:9:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:​15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:20-42:22:20" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Luke 22:20</a>) These ones will rule in heaven with Christ, and the Bible says that just 144,000 people receive that privilege.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 22:28-​30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Revelation 5:​9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 14:​1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:3-66:14:3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>In contrast to the “little flock” of those called to rule with Christ, the vast majority of us hope to be part of “a great crowd” who will gain everlasting life on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:32-42:12:32" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 12:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:​9, 10</a>) While those of us with an earthly hope do not partake of the Memorial emblems, we do join in expressing thanks for the sacrifice that Jesus made in our behalf.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 John 2:2</a>.</p>

This difference is one reason why the date on which Jehovah’s Witnesses observe the Memorial does not always coincide with the date used by modern Jews for the Passover.</p></div>
