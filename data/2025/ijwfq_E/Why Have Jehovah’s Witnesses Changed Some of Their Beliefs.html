</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>We have always used the Bible as the sole authority for our beliefs, so we have adjusted our beliefs as our understanding of the Scriptures has been clarified.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Such changes are in harmony with the Bible principle stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:​18</a>: “The path of the righteous is like the bright morning light that grows brighter and brighter until full daylight.” Just as the rising sun reveals details of a landscape gradually, God grants an understanding of divine truth progressively, in his due time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:10-60:1:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:​10-​12</a>) As the Bible foretold, he has accelerated this process during “the time of the end.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 12:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>These adjustments in our understanding should neither surprise nor disturb us. Ancient worshippers of God also had mistaken ideas and expectations and needed to adjust their viewpoint.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Moses offered himself as a deliverer for the nation of Israel 40 years ahead of God’s timetable.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:23-44:7:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 7:​23-​25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:30-44:7:30" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:35-44:7:35" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 35</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  The apostles failed to understand the prophecy that foretold the Messiah’s death and resurrection.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:8-23:53:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:​8-​12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:21-40:16:23" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Matthew 16:21-​23</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Some early Christians had wrong ideas about the timing of “the day of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:1-53:2:2" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:​1, 2</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>God later corrected their misunderstandings, and we pray that he will continue doing the same for us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:5-59:1:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 1:5</a>.</p>
