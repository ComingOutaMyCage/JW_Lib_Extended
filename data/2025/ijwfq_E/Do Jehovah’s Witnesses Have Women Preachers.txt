Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Have Women Preachers?


Yes. All of Jehovah’s Witnesses are preachers, or ministers​—including several million women. As the Bible foretold, “many, many women spread the good news.”​—Psalm 68:11, NET Bible.
Women who are Jehovah’s Witnesses follow the example set by women in the Bible. (Proverbs 31:10-​31) Although they don’t assume a leadership role within the congregation, they have a full share in the public ministry. They also teach Bible principles to their children. (Proverbs 1:8) By their words and actions, Witness women work hard to be an influence for good.​—Titus 2:​3-5.
