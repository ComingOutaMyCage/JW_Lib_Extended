What happens at a Bible study?
A personal instructor will help you get acquainted with the Bible, topic by topic. Using the interactive Bible course Enjoy Life Forever! you will progressively learn the Bible’s message as well as how it can help you. To learn more, watch this video.

Do I have to pay for the study?
No. Jehovah’s Witnesses follow the direction that Jesus gave his disciples: “You received free, give free.” (Matthew 10:8) Additionally, there is no charge for the course materials, which include a copy of the Bible and the publication entitled Enjoy Life Forever!
How long is the course?
The complete course consists of 60 lessons. The pace is up to you, but many students are comfortable covering one or more lessons per week.
How do I start?
1. Fill out the online form. We will use the personal information you submit only to fulfill your request for one of Jehovah’s Witnesses to contact you.

2. An instructor will contact you. Your instructor will explain what you can expect in your interactive Bible course and will answer any questions you may have.

3. You and your instructor make the arrangements. The study can be in person or by telephone, video call, mail, or email. Study sessions typically last about an hour, but they can be shorter or longer to suit your schedule.


Can I try out a study session first?
Yes. To do so, fill out the online form. When an instructor contacts you, let him or her know that you wish to try out the study to see if you like it. He or she will use the brochure Enjoy Life Forever! which contains three introductory lessons, to help you see if you enjoy the study.





If I accept a Bible study, will I be pressured to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
No. Jehovah’s Witnesses love teaching people about the Bible, but we never pressure anyone to join our religion. Rather, we respectfully present what the Bible says, recognizing that each person has the right to choose what he or she will believe.—1 Peter 3:15.
May I use my own Bible?
Yes, you may use any translation of the Bible that you wish. While we enjoy using the clear and accurate New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, we recognize that many people prefer using a translation that they are familiar with.
May I invite others to join the study?
Yes. You may include your entire family or any friends you choose to invite.
What if I studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses in the past? May I study again?
Yes. In fact, you may enjoy our current study course even more than before because it has been updated to meet people’s current needs. It is more visual and interactive than previous Bible study programs.
Do you offer options for Bible study without a personal instructor?
Yes. Although most students learn best with the help of an instructor, some prefer to study on their own at first. Our Bible Study Tools page lists free tools and resources that can help you in your study of the Bible. Here are tools you may find helpful:
