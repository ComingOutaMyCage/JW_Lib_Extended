Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Practice Interfaith?


As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we enjoy discussing matters of faith with people of all religions, but we do not practice interfaith in the sense of worshipping with those who have other beliefs. The Bible shows that true Christians are “harmoniously joined together,” and a key feature of this harmony is unity of belief. (Ephesians 4:​16; 1 Corinthians 1:​10; Philippians 2:2) This involves more than just agreeing on the value of such virtues as love, compassion, and forgiveness. Our religious beliefs are based on accurate knowledge from the Bible, without which our faith would be in vain.​—Romans 10:​2, 3.
The Bible compares joining in worship with people of other beliefs to being under an uneven yoke, a mismatch that would harm a Christian’s faith. (2 Corinthians 6:​14-​17) Thus, Jesus did not allow his disciples to practice interfaith. (Matthew 12:30; John 14:6) Likewise, God’s Law through Moses forbade the ancient Israelites to join in worship with their neighbors. (Exodus 34:11-​14) Faithful Israelites later rejected an offer of help that would have created a religious alliance with those of other faiths.​—Ezra 4:​1-3.
Do Jehovah’s Witnesses share in dialogue with those of other faiths?
Yes. Like the apostle Paul, we are interested in understanding the thinking and beliefs of “as many people as possible” in our ministry. (1 Corinthians 9:​19-​22) During our conversations, we sincerely try to apply the Bible’s advice to show “deep respect” for the other person.​—1 Peter 3:​15.
