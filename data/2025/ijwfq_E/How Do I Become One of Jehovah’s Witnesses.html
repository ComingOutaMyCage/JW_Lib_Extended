</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The steps needed to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses are described by Jesus and can be found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>. That passage outlines what a person needs to do to become a disciple of Christ, which involves speaking, or bearing witness, about Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Step 1: Learn what the Bible teaches.</strong> Jesus instructed his followers to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) The word translated “disciple” literally means “a learner.” The Bible, especially the teachings of Jesus Christ found there, contains the information you need in order to have a happy and fulfilling life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:​16, 17</a>) We are glad to help you learn what the Bible teaches by means of our <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=whbs" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502014311&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">free Bible study program</a>.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:7-40:10:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 10:​7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:13-52:2:13" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Thessalonians 2:​13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Step 2: Put what you learn into practice.</strong> Jesus said that those who learn must also “observe all the things [he] commanded.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 28:20</a>) This means that your study of the Bible must be more than an intellectual exercise​—it may call on you to make significant changes in your thinking and behavior. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:42-44:10:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 10:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:22-49:4:29" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:​22-​29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) Those who observe Jesus’ commands are then moved to make a personal decision to follow him by dedicating their lives to Jehovah God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 16:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Step 3: Get baptized.</strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>) In the Bible, <a class="xt" data-xtid="79" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005148/">baptism</a> is compared to a burial. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:2-45:6:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 6:​2-4</a>.) It serves as a symbol of dying to a past course of life and beginning a new one. Your baptism, then, is a public acknowledgment that you have completed the first two steps described by Jesus and are asking God for a clean conscience.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:14-58:9:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:​14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:​21</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>How will I know if I’m ready for baptism?</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Speak to the congregation elders. They will talk with you to ensure that you understand what is involved, are applying what you have learned, and have dedicated yourself to God of your own free will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:1-60:5:3" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:​1-3</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Do these steps apply to children of Witness parents?</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Yes. We raise our children “in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah,” just as the Bible commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) However, as they grow, they must make a personal decision to learn, accept, and apply what the Bible teaches before they can qualify for baptism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>) Ultimately, each person must make his own choice concerning worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 14:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:5</a>.</p>
