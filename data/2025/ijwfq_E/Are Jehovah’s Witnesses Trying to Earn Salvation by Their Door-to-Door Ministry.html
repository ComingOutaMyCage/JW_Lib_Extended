<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No. We engage regularly in our door-to-door ministry, but we don’t believe that we earn our salvation by doing such work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:8-49:2:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:8</a>) Why not?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Think of this comparison: Imagine that a benevolent man promised an expensive gift to everyone who showed up at a certain location on a given date. If you really believed the man’s promise, would you follow his instructions? No doubt! Likely, you would also tell your friends and family about the opportunity, so that they too could benefit from it. Even so, you wouldn’t <em>earn</em> the gift by following the man’s instructions. The gift is still a gift.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Likewise, Jehovah’s Witnesses believe God’s promise of everlasting life for all who obey him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>) We endeavor to share our faith with others, hoping that they will benefit from God’s promises. But we don’t believe that we <em>earn</em> our salvation by engaging in our ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:17-45:1:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:28-45:3:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:28</a>) Really, no human could ever do enough to merit such an astounding blessing from God. “He saved us because of his mercy, and not because of any good things that we have done.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:5-56:3:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Titus 3:5</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version.</em></p>
