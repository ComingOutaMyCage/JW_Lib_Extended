<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses receive ongoing training in all facets of Christian living, which includes their personal public ministry. This ministry is the work that Jesus commanded his followers to do—the preaching and teaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) We receive that training at our weekly meetings and our annual conventions and assemblies. Jehovah’s Witnesses who have responsibilities in the congregation or in the organization receive further training at special Bible schools.</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>What training do Jehovah’s Witnesses receive?</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Congregation meetings.</strong> Every week, we attend two meetings at our places of worship called Kingdom Halls. One meeting is normally held midweek; the other is on the weekend. They are open to the public and no collections are taken.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Midweek meeting.</strong> We receive instruction in reading, the art of conversation, public speaking, and preaching and teaching. The training is provided through talks, discussions, demonstrations, and video presentations. This training helps us be more effective as we share the Bible’s message with others and conduct personal Bible studies with interested ones. All who attend the meetings benefit from this training. Above all, our meetings strengthen our faith in God and our love for him and for our fellow believers.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>Weekend meeting.</strong> This two-part meeting begins with a Bible discourse that is especially designed for the general public. The second part of the meeting is a question and answer discussion of an article published in the study edition of <em>The Watchtower.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The articles discuss and explain Bible topics and principles that help us both in our ministry and in our personal life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Assemblies and conventions.</strong> Every year we have three large gatherings, each of which is attended by many congregations. These joyful events focus on a specific Bible-based theme and include discourses, skits, interviews, and videos. As with our congregation meetings, assemblies and conventions further our knowledge of the Bible and help us to be better ministers of the good news. Once again, the public is welcome to attend, and no collections are taken.</p>
