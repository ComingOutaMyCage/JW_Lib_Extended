<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>No, you are not obligated in any way. Millions enjoy our Bible study program without becoming Jehovah’s Witnesses.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The purpose of the program is to show you what the Bible teaches. What you decide to do with that knowledge is up to you. We recognize that faith is a personal matter.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joshua 24:15</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>Can I use my own Bible during the study?</strong></h2>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Yes. Although we enjoy using the modern-language <a class="xt" data-xtid="80" href="jwpub://p/E:1001061103/"><em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em></a> and will give you a copy free of charge if you would like to have one, we would be happy for you to use your own Bible. You can learn about the Bible’s message of hope and salvation from nearly any translation.</p>
<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Why do you study with people who don’t join your faith?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  Our primary motive is love for Jehovah God, who wants Christians to teach others what they have learned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37, 38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) We feel that there is no greater privilege than to be “God’s fellow workers” in helping people to learn what his Word teaches.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:​6-9</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  We are also motivated by love for our neighbors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39</a>) We find joy in sharing with others the wonderful things we have learned.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
