<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Following the model of first-century Christianity, Jehovah’s Witnesses have no clergy-laity division. All baptized Witnesses are ordained ministers and share in the preaching and teaching work. Witnesses are organized into congregations of about 100 believers. Spiritually mature men in each congregation serve as “older men,” or elders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:5-56:1:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 1:5</a>) They do so without being paid for their services.</p>
