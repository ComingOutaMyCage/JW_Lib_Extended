<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Yes. We believe in Jesus, who said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) We have faith that Jesus came to earth from heaven and gave his perfect human life as a ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>) His death and resurrection make it possible for those exercising faith in him to gain everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) We also believe that Jesus is now ruling as King of God’s heavenly Kingdom, which will soon bring peace to the entire earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) However, we take Jesus at his word when he said: “The Father is greater than I am.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>) So we do not worship Jesus, as we do not believe that he is Almighty God.</p>
