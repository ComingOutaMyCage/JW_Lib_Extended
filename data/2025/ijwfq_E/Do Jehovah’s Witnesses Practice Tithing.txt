Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Practice Tithing?


No, Jehovah’s Witnesses do not practice tithing; our work is financed by voluntary donations. What is a tithe, and why don’t Jehovah’s Witnesses practice tithing?
The commandment to tithe, or contribute a tenth of one’s belongings, was part of the Law given to the ancient nation of Israel. However, the Bible makes it clear that this Law​—including the “commandment to collect tithes”​—does not apply to Christians.​—Hebrews 7:​5, 18; Colossians 2:​13, 14.
Rather than giving required tithes and offerings, Jehovah’s Witnesses imitate the early Christians and support their ministry in two ways: by performing their personal ministerial work without pay and by making voluntary donations.
We thus follow the Bible’s direction to Christians: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.”​—2 Corinthians 9:7.
