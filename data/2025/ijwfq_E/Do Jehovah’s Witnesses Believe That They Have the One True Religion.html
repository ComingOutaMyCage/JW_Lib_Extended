<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Those who are serious about religion should think that the one they’ve chosen is acceptable to God and Jesus. Otherwise, why would they be involved in it?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Jesus Christ didn’t agree with the view that there are many religions, many roads, all leading to salvation. Rather, he said: “Narrow is the gate and cramped the road leading off into life, and few are the ones finding it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:14-40:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:14</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that they’ve found that road. Otherwise, they’d look for another religion.</p>
