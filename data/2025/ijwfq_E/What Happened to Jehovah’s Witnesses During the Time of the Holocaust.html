<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>About 1,500 of Jehovah’s Witnesses died during the time of the Holocaust, out of some 35,000 Witnesses living in Germany and Nazi-occupied countries. The cause of death is not known in all cases. Since research is ongoing, figures and other details may be updated in time.</p>

<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>Severe detention conditions:</strong> More than 1,000 Witnesses died in Nazi concentration camps and prisons.

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Why were they persecuted?</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses were persecuted because they adhered to the Bible’s teachings. When the Nazi state demanded that the Witnesses do what the Bible forbids, the Witnesses refused to comply. They chose to “obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 5:​29</a>) Consider two areas in which they made that choice.</p>
