SONG 79 Teach Them to Stand Firm

Help Bible Students to Take a Stand for the Truth


“Stand firm in the faith . . . Grow strong.”​—1 COR. 16:13, ftn.


FOCUS
How we can help Bible students to develop the faith and courage they need to take a stand for the truth.


1-2. (a) Why do some Bible students hesitate to take a stand for the truth? (b) What will we consider in this article?

Your answers


DID you have reservations about becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Perhaps you were afraid that your workmates, friends, or family would turn against you. Or maybe you felt that you would never be able to live up to God’s standards. If so, you can empathize with Bible students who seem reluctant to take a stand for the truth.
2 Jesus recognized that such fears could easily prevent spiritual growth. (Matt. 13:20-22) But he did not give up on those who hesitated to follow him. Rather, he showed his disciples how to help such ones to (1) identify obstacles to their progress, (2) deepen their love for Jehovah, (3) adjust their priorities, and (4) overcome their challenges. How can we apply what Jesus told his disciples as we use the Enjoy Life Forever! book to help a Bible student take a stand for the truth?
HELP YOUR STUDENT TO IDENTIFY OBSTACLES TO HIS PROGRESS
 3. What may have prevented Nicodemus from becoming one of Jesus’ disciples?

Your answer


3 Nicodemus, a prominent leader of the Jews, faced an obstacle to becoming one of Jesus’ disciples. Only about six months after Jesus began his ministry, Nicodemus recognized Jesus as God’s representative. (John 3:1, 2) However, Nicodemus chose to meet Jesus secretly for “fear of the Jews.” (John 7:13; 12:42) He may have thought that he had too much to lose by becoming a disciple of Jesus.a
 4. How did Jesus help Nicodemus to understand what God expected him to do?

Your answer


4 Nicodemus had knowledge of the Law, but he needed help in understanding what Jehovah expected of him. How did Jesus help him? Jesus was generous with his time, even meeting Nicodemus at night. And Jesus clearly stated what Nicodemus had to do in order to become a disciple: repent of his sins, get baptized in water, and exercise faith in the Son of God.​—John 3:5, 14-21.
 5. How can we help a Bible student to identify what is hindering his progress?

Your answer


5 Even if a Bible student has a good grasp of the Scriptures, he may need help in identifying what is hindering his progress. Secular work or family opposition may distract him from spiritual goals. So make yourself available to your student. You might invite him to join you for a cup of coffee or a walk. In such an informal setting, you may be able to help him to open up about his challenges. Encourage your student to make any necessary adjustments, not to please you, but to show his love for Jehovah.
 6. How can you help a student to find the courage to take a stand for the truth? (1 Corinthians 16:13)

Your answer


6 When a Bible student is confident that Jehovah will help him to live by Bible standards, he will gain the courage to apply what he is learning. (Read 1 Corinthians 16:13.) Your role can be compared to that of a school teacher. Thinking back to your school days, what kind of teacher did you like best? Probably it was the teacher who patiently helped you to build confidence in your abilities. In a similar way, a good Bible teacher does not just teach what God wants us to do but also assures his student that with Jehovah’s help he can make the necessary adjustments in his life. How can you do that?
HELP YOUR STUDENT TO DEEPEN HIS LOVE FOR JEHOVAH
 7. How did Jesus help those who listened to him to grow in their love for Jehovah?

Your answer


7 Jesus knew that love for God would motivate his disciples to apply what they had learned. He often taught things that would help his disciples to grow in their love for their heavenly Father. For example, he compared Jehovah to a man who gives good things to his children. (Matt. 7:9-11) Some of Jesus’ listeners may not have had such an affectionate father. Imagine how they must have felt when Jesus gave the illustration of a compassionate father who welcomed the return of his son who had been on a wayward course. They could see Jehovah’s compassion for his earthly children.​—Luke 15:20-24.
 8. How can you help a Bible student to deepen his love for Jehovah?

Your answer


8 You too can help a Bible student to deepen his love for Jehovah by emphasizing God’s qualities in your teaching. During each study session, help him to make a connection between what he is learning and Jehovah’s love. When discussing the ransom, emphasize how it applies to him. (Rom. 5:8; 1 John 4:10) A student is likely to be moved to love Jehovah when reflecting on Jehovah’s love for him personally.​—Gal. 2:20.
 9. What helped a man named Michael to change his life course?

Your answer


9 Consider Michael, from Indonesia. He was raised around the truth but did not get baptized. At age 18, he went abroad to work as a truck driver. He later married but left his family behind to continue working abroad. In the meantime, his wife and daughter began to study the Bible and to make progress. After his mother died, Michael decided to return home to care for his father and agreed to have a Bible study. When considering the “Dig Deeper” section in lesson 27 of the Enjoy Life Forever! book, Michael was profoundly touched. As he reflected on how Jehovah must have felt to see His Son suffer, Michael was moved to tears. He developed deep gratitude for the ransom and was moved to change his life course and get baptized.
HELP YOUR STUDENT TO ADJUST HIS PRIORITIES
10. How did Jesus help his early disciples to adjust their priorities? (Luke 5:5-11) (See also picture.)

Your answer


10 The early disciples quickly recognized Jesus as the promised Messiah, but they needed help to make the ministry their priority. Peter and Andrew had already been disciples for some time when Jesus invited them to follow him full-time. (Matt. 4:18, 19) They were involved in a thriving fishing business, apparently associated with James and John. (Mark 1:16-20) When Peter and Andrew “abandoned their nets,” they likely made plans to provide for their family while they followed Jesus. What moved them to adjust their priorities? The account in Luke tells us that Jesus performed a miracle that strengthened their confidence in Jehovah’s ability to provide for them.​—Read Luke 5:5-11.




What can we learn from the way Jesus helped his disciples to adjust their priorities? (See paragraph 10)b




11. How can we use our own experiences to strengthen a student’s faith?

Your answer


11 We cannot perform miracles, as Jesus did, but we can share experiences of how Jehovah supports those who put Him first in their lives. For example, do you remember how Jehovah helped you when you began attending meetings? Perhaps you had to meet with your employer and explain why you could no longer work overtime if it interfered with your meeting attendance. As you share your experiences with your student, explain how your faith was strengthened by seeing Jehovah support your decision to make his worship your priority.
12. (a) Why should we invite different publishers to a Bible study? (b) How can you use videos to teach your student effectively? Give an example.

Your answers


12 Your student will also benefit from hearing how other Christians have adjusted their priorities. So invite fellow believers from a variety of backgrounds to join you on the Bible study. Ask them to explain how they came into the truth and what they did to make Jehovah’s service their priority in life. In addition, take time with your student to watch the videos from either the “Dig Deeper” or the “Explore” section of the Enjoy Life Forever! book. To illustrate, when discussing lesson 37, you could highlight principles from the video Jehovah Will Care for Our Needs.
HELP YOUR STUDENT TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES
13. How did Jesus prepare his disciples for opposition?

Your answer


13 Jesus repeatedly told his followers that they would face opposition from others, even from relatives. (Matt. 5:11; 10:22, 36) As Jesus’ ministry drew to a close, he warned his disciples that they could face death. (Matt. 24:9; John 15:20; 16:2) He urged them to be cautious in their ministry. He advised them not to confront those who oppose them and to be discreet so that they could continue to preach.
14. How can we help a student to prepare for opposition? (2 Timothy 3:12)

Your answer


14 We can help a student to prepare for opposition by explaining what he might expect to hear from coworkers, friends, and relatives. (Read 2 Timothy 3:12.) Some coworkers may make fun of the student’s new way of life. Others, even close relatives, may criticize his Bible-based beliefs. The sooner we prepare our students to deal with opposition, the better equipped they will be when it comes.
15. What could help a Bible student to cope with family opposition?

Your answer


15 In connection with family opposition, encourage your student to think about why his relatives may be upset. They may think that he has been misled, or they may simply be prejudiced against Jehovah’s Witnesses. Even Jesus faced negative reactions from those he loved. (Mark 3:21; John 7:5) Teach your student to remain patient and tactful with others, including family members.
16. How can we help a Bible student to share his beliefs in a tactful way?

Your answer


16 Even when relatives show interest, a student is wise not to explain everything all at once. Otherwise, his loved ones may feel overwhelmed and, as a result, be reluctant to have another conversation. So encourage your student to share his beliefs in a way that leaves the door open for future conversations. (Col. 4:6) Perhaps he could invite his relatives to visit jw.org. This would allow them to learn more about Jehovah’s Witnesses at their own pace.
17. How can you train a student to deal with the misconceptions others may have about Jehovah’s Witnesses? (See also picture.)

Your answer


17 You might use the jw.org series “Frequently Asked Questions” to help your student prepare simple answers to questions that relatives or workmates might ask. (2 Tim. 2:24, 25) At the end of each lesson, review the “Some People Say” section of the Enjoy Life Forever! book. Encourage your student to rehearse answers in his own words. Do not hesitate to give him suggestions on how he could improve his response. Such practice sessions will help him to defend his own faith confidently.




Encourage your Bible student to share her faith publicly by practicing beforehand (See paragraph 17)c




18. How can you encourage a student to share his faith in the ministry? (Matthew 10:27)

Your answer


18 Jesus urged his disciples to proclaim the good news publicly. (Read Matthew 10:27.) The sooner a student begins to share his faith, the sooner he will learn to rely on Jehovah. How can you help a student to make this his goal? When a preaching campaign is announced for the congregation, encourage your student to think about how he could qualify as a publisher. Explain why many have found it easier to begin preaching during such campaigns. He might also benefit from the public-speaking training given during mid-week meetings. As he pursues this goal, he will learn to express his beliefs with conviction.
SHOW CONFIDENCE IN YOUR STUDENT
19. How did Jesus show confidence in his disciples, and how can we imitate him?

Your answer


19 Before Jesus ascended to heaven, he told his disciples that they would be reunited with him. They did not grasp that Jesus was speaking about their going to heaven. Still, he focused on their loyalty, not on their doubts. (John 14:1-5, 8) He knew that they needed time to understand certain things, such as the heavenly hope. (John 16:12) We too can show confidence in our student’s desire to please Jehovah.
The sooner a student begins to share his faith, the sooner he will learn to rely on Jehovah

20. How did a sister in Malawi show confidence in her student?

Your answer


20 We remain hopeful that our student wants to do the right thing. Take, for example, Chifundo, a sister in Malawi. She started a Bible study in the Enjoy Life Forever! book with a young Catholic woman named Alinafe. As they finished discussing lesson 14, Chifundo asked her student what she thought about using images in worship. Alinafe became very emotional and replied, “That is a personal choice!” Chifundo wondered if that would be the end of the Bible study. But she patiently continued to study with Alinafe, hopeful that in time she would get the point. A few months later, Chifundo asked her the question in lesson 34: “How has your study of the Bible and the true God, Jehovah, benefited you so far?” Chifundo relates how Alinafe responded, “She mentioned so many wonderful points, one of which was that the Witnesses do not engage in practices that the Bible condemns.” Soon thereafter, Alinafe stopped using images and qualified for baptism.
21. How can we strengthen a student’s desire to take a stand for the truth?

Your answer


21 Even though Jehovah is the one “who makes it grow,” we have a role in helping a Bible student to make progress. (1 Cor. 3:7) We do more than teach him what God wants him to do. We help him to develop a deep love for Jehovah. We also encourage him to show his love by adjusting his priorities. And we teach him how to rely on Jehovah in the face of challenges. By expressing confidence in him, we strengthen his conviction that he too can live up to Jehovah’s standards and take a firm stand for the truth.

SONG 55 Fear Them Not!

a Two and a half years after his encounter with Jesus, Nicodemus was still a member of the high court of the Jews. (John 7:45-52) One reference work states that according to tradition, Nicodemus became a disciple only after Jesus died.​—John 19:38-40.
