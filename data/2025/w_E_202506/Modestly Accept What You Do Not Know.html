Or we might feel that our past mistakes are so bad that Jehovah would never want to know us and that he is far away from us. Even David at times had similar feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:18-19:38:18" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 38:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:38:21-19:38:21" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 21</a>) Or a person who is sincerely trying to change his lifestyle and live by God’s righteous standards might wonder, ‘If God really understood me, why would he expect me to <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>reject a way of life that feels so natural to me?’</p>

Yet, though he sees flaws in us and understands why we feel and act the way we do, he loves us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:15-45:7:15" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rom. 7:15</a>) When we come to appreciate deeply that Jehovah sees the potential in us, we can increase the confidence we need to serve him faithfully and to do so with joy.</p>
