Lessons for Living From a Deathbed Prophecy​—Part 1


“Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the final part of the days.”​—GEN. 49:1.


FOCUS
Practical lessons from Jacob’s deathbed prophecy regarding Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.


1-2. What did Jacob do near the end of his life, and why? (See also picture.)

Your answer


SOME 17 years have passed since Jehovah’s faithful servant Jacob traveled from Canaan to Egypt with his household. (Gen. 47:28) During that time, he experienced the great joy of being reunited with his beloved son Joseph and finally seeing his family together again. But now, Jacob senses that his life is coming to an end. So he calls an important family meeting.​—Gen. 49:28.
2 In those days, it was common for a dying family head to gather the members of his family together to give them his final instructions. (Isa. 38:1) He might at that meeting also indicate who would be the head of the family after his death.




Jacob on his deathbed, delivering a prophecy to his 12 sons (See paragraphs 1-2)




 3. According to Genesis 49:1, 2, why are Jacob’s expressions especially meaningful?

Your answer


3 Read Genesis 49:1, 2. But this was no ordinary family meeting. Jacob was a prophet. During this meeting, Jehovah inspired his servant to speak about important future events that would greatly affect his descendants. For that reason, Jacob’s words are sometimes referred to as his deathbed prophecy.
 4. What should we keep in mind as we examine Jacob’s deathbed prophecy? (See also the box “Jacob’s Family.”)

Your answer


4 In this article, we will consider what Jacob said to four of his sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. In the following article, we will discuss Jacob’s words to his eight other sons. As we will see, Jacob spoke not only about his sons but also about their descendants, who would eventually become the nation of ancient Israel. A review of that nation’s history will make clear how Jacob’s prophetic words came true. And by examining his words, we will learn valuable lessons that can help us to please our heavenly Father, Jehovah.





REUBEN
 5. What privilege may Reuben have expected to receive from his father?

Your answer


5 Jacob first addresses Reuben, saying: “You are my firstborn.” (Gen. 49:3) As firstborn, Reuben likely expected to receive a double portion of his father’s belongings. He may also have expected to become the head of the family after his father’s death and to have that privilege passed on to his own offspring in time.
 6. Why did Reuben lose out on receiving the right of firstborn? (Genesis 49:3, 4)

Your answer


6 However, Reuben lost out on receiving the right of firstborn. (1 Chron. 5:1) Why? Some years earlier he had sexual relations with Jacob’s concubine Bilhah. She had been the maidservant of Jacob’s beloved wife, Rachel, who had died. (Gen. 35:19, 22) Reuben was the son of Jacob’s other wife, Leah. Perhaps Reuben was driven by lust. Or possibly he violated Bilhah to prevent her from taking his mother’s place in Jacob’s affections. In any event, what he did was very displeasing to Jehovah and to his father.​—Read Genesis 49:3, 4.
 7. What happened to Reuben and his descendants? (See also the box “Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy.”)

Your answer


7 Jacob told Reuben: “You will not excel.” Those words came true. There is no record of any of Reuben’s descendants becoming a king, a priest, or a prophet. Yet, Jacob did not disown his son, and Reuben’s descendants did become a full tribe in Israel. (Josh. 12:6) Reuben had demonstrated fine qualities in other situations, and there is no record that he ever committed immorality again.​—Gen. 37:20-22; 42:37.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Reuben

Pronouncement

“You will not excel.”​—Gen. 49:4.

Fulfillment

The tribe of Reuben never had a leadership role in Israel.​—1 Chron. 5:1, 2.





 8. What lessons can we draw from Reuben’s example?

Your answer


8 What can we learn? We need to work hard to cultivate self-control and to reject sexual misconduct. If we are ever tempted to commit a sin, we should stop and think about how our actions would hurt Jehovah, our family, and others. We should also remember that “whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap.” (Gal. 6:7) On the other hand, what happened to Reuben reminds us of Jehovah’s mercy. Although Jehovah will not shield us from the consequences of our mistakes, he will bless our efforts when we do what is right.
SIMEON AND LEVI
 9. What prompted Jacob’s words of disapproval to Simeon and Levi? (Genesis 49:5-7)

Your answer


9 Read Genesis 49:5-7. Next, using strong words of disapproval, Jacob addresses Simeon and Levi. Years earlier, Jacob’s daughter, Dinah, had been raped by a Canaanite man named Shechem. Understandably, all of Jacob’s sons were very upset about what had happened to their sister, but Simeon and Levi became violent. They deceitfully promised to make peace with the men of Shechem if they all agreed to get circumcised. The men complied. While they were still in pain from the circumcision, Simeon and Levi “each took his sword and went into the unsuspecting city and killed every male.”​—Gen. 34:25-29.
10. How were Jacob’s prophetic words about Simeon and Levi fulfilled? (See also the box “Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy.”)

Your answer


10 Jacob was deeply troubled by the violent actions of his two sons. He foretold that they would be dispersed and scattered throughout Israel. Those prophetic words came true over 200 years later when the nation of Israel entered the Promised Land. The tribe of Simeon received as its inheritance isolated portions of land inside Judah’s tribal territory. (Josh. 19:1) Levi’s inheritance consisted of 48 cities scattered throughout Israel.​—Josh. 21:41.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Simeon

Pronouncement

“Let me disperse them in Jacob.”​—Gen. 49:7.

Fulfillment

Simeon’s tribal inheritance consisted of isolated portions of land inside Judah’s territory.​—Josh. 19:1-8.










Son

Levi

Pronouncement

“Let me scatter them in Israel.”​—Gen. 49:7.

Fulfillment

The tribe of Levi was scattered in 48 cities throughout Israel.​—Josh. 21:41.





11. What good things did the tribes of Simeon and Levi do?

Your answer


11 The descendants of Simeon and Levi did not repeat the mistakes of their forefathers. The tribe of Levi showed great loyalty for pure worship. When Moses received the Law from Jehovah at Mount Sinai, many Israelites got involved with idolatrous calf worship but the Levites rallied to Moses’ side and helped him to clear out that badness. (Ex. 32:26-29) Jehovah chose to set the tribe of Levi apart, giving it the precious privilege of the priesthood. (Ex. 40:12-15; Num. 3:11, 12) Later, during the conquest of the Promised Land, the Simeonites valiantly fought alongside the Judeans, in line with Jehovah’s purpose.​—Judg. 1:3, 17.
12. What lessons can we draw from the examples of Simeon and Levi?

Your answer


12 What can we learn? Never allow anger to drive your decisions and actions. If you or a loved one have been mistreated, it is only natural to be upset. (Ps. 4:4) We need to remember, though, that Jehovah does not approve of words and deeds that reflect bitter anger. (Jas. 1:20) We deal with an injustice​—either inside or outside the congregation—​in harmony with Bible principles, thus avoiding the harm that uncontrolled anger causes. (Rom. 12:17, 19; 1 Pet. 3:9) Even if your parents are doing things that are not pleasing to Jehovah, remember that you are not obligated to follow their example. Do not conclude that you are a lost cause and that you cannot have Jehovah’s blessing. Jehovah will not fail to reward your efforts to move ahead and do what is right.
JUDAH
13. Why might Judah have felt anxious when it was his turn to hear his father’s words?

Your answer


13 Judah was the next son to be addressed by his father. After hearing Jacob’s words to his older brothers, Judah may have felt anxious. After all, he had made some serious mistakes too. He evidently shared in plundering the city of Shechem. (Gen. 34:27) He joined his brothers in selling Joseph as a slave and in deceiving their father about it. (Gen. 37:31-33) Later, he had sexual relations with his daughter-in-law Tamar, thinking that she was a prostitute.​—Gen. 38:15-18.
14. What good things had Judah done? (Genesis 49:8, 9)

Your answer


14 Yet, under inspiration, Jacob offered Judah only blessing and commendation. (Read Genesis 49:8, 9.) Judah had shown great concern for the feelings of his elderly father. And he had also shown compassion for his youngest brother, Benjamin.​—Gen. 44:18, 30-34.
15. In what ways did Judah’s blessing prove true?

Your answer


15 Jacob foretold that Judah would have a leading role among his brothers. However, the fulfillment of that prophecy was a long time in coming. Judah is first mentioned as taking the lead some 200 years later when, after the Exodus, the tribe led the nation of Israel through the wilderness into the Promised Land. (Num. 10:14) Decades later, Judah took the lead in the conquest of the Promised Land. (Judg. 1:1, 2) And David, one of Judah’s descendants, was the first of a long line of kings coming from that tribe. But there is more.
16. How was the prophecy found at Genesis 49:10 fulfilled? (See also the box “Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy.”)

Your answer


16 Jacob revealed that the permanent Ruler of mankind would be a descendant of Judah. (Read Genesis 49:10 and footnote.) That Ruler is Jesus Christ, the one whom Jacob called Shiloh. Of Jesus, an angel said: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father.” (Luke 1:32, 33) Jesus is also called “the Lion of the tribe of Judah.”​—Rev. 5:5.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Judah

Pronouncement

“The scepter will not depart from Judah . . . until Shiloh comes.”​—Gen. 49:10.

Fulfillment

Jesus, a descendant of Judah, would be King of God’s Kingdom.​—Luke 1:32, 33.





17. How can we imitate Jehovah in the way we view others?

Your answer


17 What can we learn? Jehovah blessed Judah even though he made some serious mistakes. But could it be that Judah’s brothers wondered what Jehovah saw in him? Whatever the case, Jehovah saw good in Judah and blessed him for it. How can we imitate Jehovah’s example? When a fellow Christian receives a special privilege, we might at first be tempted to focus on that person’s imperfections. But we do well to remember that Jehovah is certainly pleased with his fine qualities. Jehovah looks for the good in his worshippers. Let us strive to do the same.
18. Why do we need to be patient?

Your answer


18 Another lesson we can learn from Judah’s experience is the need to be patient. Jehovah always fulfills his promises, but he does not always do so in a manner or at a time that we expect. Judah’s descendants did not immediately begin taking the lead among God’s people. But they loyally supported those whom Jehovah appointed to do so, whether it was Moses the Levite, Joshua the Ephraimite, or King Saul the Benjaminite. May we too support whomever Jehovah chooses to take the lead among us today.​—Heb. 6:12.
19. What can we learn about Jehovah from this discussion of Jacob’s deathbed prophecy?

Your answer


19 What have we seen thus far in our discussion of Jacob’s deathbed prophecy? It is clear that “the way man sees is not the way God sees.” (1 Sam. 16:7) Jehovah is very patient and forgiving. While he does not excuse wrong conduct, he also does not expect perfection from his worshippers. He can even bless individuals who have made serious mistakes in the past if they sincerely repent and turn to doing what is right. In the next article, we will consider what Jacob said to his remaining eight sons.
