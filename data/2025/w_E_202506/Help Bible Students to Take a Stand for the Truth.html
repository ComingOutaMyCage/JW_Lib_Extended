How can you help a student to make this his goal? When a preaching campaign is announced for the congregation, encourage your student to think about how he could qualify as a publisher. Explain why many have found it easier to begin preaching during such campaigns. He might also benefit from the public-speaking training given during mid-week meetings. As he pursues this goal, he will learn to express his beliefs with conviction.</p>

Take, for example, Chifundo, a sister in Malawi. She started a Bible study in the <em>Enjoy Life Forever!</em> book with a young Catholic woman named Alinafe. As they finished discussing <a class="xt" data-xtid="10" href="jwpub://p/E:1102021214/">lesson 14</a>, Chifundo asked her student what she thought about using images in worship. Alinafe became very emotional and replied, “That is a personal choice!” Chifundo wondered if that would be the end of the Bible study. But she patiently continued to study with Alinafe, hopeful that in time she would get the point. A few months later, Chifundo asked her the question in <a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:1102021234/">lesson 34</a>: “How has your study of the Bible and the true God, Jehovah, benefited you so far?” Chifundo relates how Alinafe responded, “She mentioned so many wonderful points, one of which was that the Witnesses do not engage in practices that the Bible condemns.” Soon thereafter, Alinafe stopped using images and qualified for baptism.</p>
