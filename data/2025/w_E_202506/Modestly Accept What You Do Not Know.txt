SONG 123 Loyally Submitting to Theocratic Order

Modestly Accept What You Do Not Know


“Understanding the Almighty is beyond our reach.”​—JOB 37:23.


FOCUS
Coping with uncertainty when we modestly accept what we do not know, focus on what we do know, and put our trust in Jehovah.


 1. What ability did Jehovah give us, and why?

Your answer


JEHOVAH created us with the ability to think, to take in knowledge, to develop understanding, and to display wisdom. Why did he make us this way? He wants us to “find the knowledge of God” and to serve him with our power of reason.​—Prov. 2:1-5; Rom. 12:1.
 2. (a) What limitations do we have? (Job 37:23, 24) (See also picture.) (b) How do we benefit by modestly accepting our limitations?

Your answers


2 Although we have the capacity to learn, we have limitations in what we do know. (Read Job 37:23, 24.) Consider Job’s example. He was confronted with a series of questions that revealed just how much he did not know. That experience humbled him and helped to correct his thinking. (Job 42:3-6) We too benefit when we modestly recognize that we do not know everything. Such modesty moves us to trust that Jehovah will reveal to us what we really need to know so that we can make wise choices.​—Prov. 2:6.




Acknowledging what we do not know can benefit us, as it did Job (See paragraph 2)




 3. What will we discuss in this article?

Your answer


3 In this article, we will discuss some things that we do not know and the challenges we may face as a result. We will also examine why it is good that we do not know certain things. Discussing these points will strengthen our confidence that Jehovah, “the One perfect in knowledge,” tells us what we really need to know.​—Job 37:16.
WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE END WILL COME
 4. According to Matthew 24:36, what is one fact that we do not know?

Your answer


4 Read Matthew 24:36. We do not know when the end of this system of things will come. Even Jesus, while on earth, did not know the “day and hour.”a He later told the apostles that Jehovah, who is the Great Timekeeper, keeps the timing of certain events “in his own jurisdiction,” or authority. (Acts 1:6, 7) Jehovah has scheduled the time for the end of this system, but we are not in a position to figure out precisely when that will be.
 5. Because we do not know when the end will come, how might we be affected?

Your answer


5 In view of what Jesus said, we do not know how long we will have to wait until the end comes. As a result, we might become impatient or discouraged, especially if we have already been waiting for some time for Jehovah’s day. Or we might find it hard to endure ridicule from family members or others. (2 Pet. 3:3, 4) It is possible to feel that if we knew the exact day that the end would come, we would be more patient and we would be able to endure ridicule more easily.
 6. Why is it good that we do not know when the end will come?

Your answer


6 Actually, by not revealing the date for the end, Jehovah gives us the opportunity to show that we serve him because we love him and trust in him. We are not serving Jehovah with a deadline in mind, as if our faith in him had an expiration date. Instead of focusing primarily on when “the day of Jehovah” will come, we do well to focus on what that day will accomplish. In doing so, we continue to deepen our devotion to God and do all we can to please him.​—2 Pet. 3:11, 12.
 7. What do we know?

Your answer


7 We do well to focus on what we do know​—that the last days began in 1914. Jehovah has provided Bible prophecies that not only pinpoint that year but also describe in detail the conditions that have prevailed since then. As a result, we are convinced that “the great day of Jehovah is near.” (Zeph. 1:14) We also know the work that Jehovah wants us to do, namely, to tell as many as possible about the “good news of the Kingdom.” (Matt. 24:14) This message is being declared in some 240 lands and in more than 1,000 languages. We do not need to know the “day and hour” in order to have a zealous share in this vital work.
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW JEHOVAH MAY ACT
 8. What does “the work of the true God” refer to? (Ecclesiastes 11:5)

Your answer


8 We do not always know “the work of the true God.” (Read Ecclesiastes 11:5.) That expression refers to what Jehovah causes to happen or what he allows to happen in order to accomplish his will. We cannot know for certain why Jehovah might permit something to occur or exactly how he will act in our behalf. (Ps. 37:5) Such knowledge is as unfathomable to us as is the development of a child in a pregnant woman’s womb, something that scientists still do not fully understand.
 9. Because we do not know how Jehovah will act, what challenges could we face?

Your answer


9 Our not knowing how Jehovah will act in our behalf could cause us to become indecisive. We might hesitate to make sacrifices to expand our ministry, such as simplifying our life or moving to where there is a greater need for Kingdom publishers. Or we may wonder whether we have God’s approval if we do not reach our theocratic goals, if we do not see outstanding results for our hard work in the ministry, or if we face obstacles in a theocratic project.
10. What essential qualities are we helped to develop by not knowing how Jehovah will act?

Your answer


10 Our not knowing how Jehovah will act actually helps us to develop such essential qualities as humility and modesty. We come to recognize that Jehovah’s thoughts and ways are higher than ours. (Isa. 55:8, 9) We also learn to trust in Jehovah more fully, relying on him for success. When we have good results in the ministry or in a theocratic project, we rightly give Jehovah the praise. (Ps. 127:1; 1 Cor. 3:7) If matters do not turn out as we expected, we need to remember that Jehovah is still in full control. (Isa. 26:12) We do our part, and we continue to trust that Jehovah will do his part. We are confident that he will provide us with the direction we need, even if not in the same miraculous way that he sometimes did in the past.​—Acts 16:6-10.
11. What do we know that can help us?

Your answer


11 Reflect on the fact that we know that Jehovah is always loving, just, and wise. We know that he highly values what we do for him and for our fellow worshippers. And we know that Jehovah always rewards those who are loyal to him.​—Heb. 11:6.
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW
12. According to James 4:13, 14, of what are we uncertain?

Your answer


12 Read James 4:13, 14. A fundamental truth is that we do not know what our life will be like tomorrow. In this system of things, we are subject to “time and unexpected events.” (Eccl. 9:11) As a result, we cannot know whether our plans will succeed or even if we will be alive to see our plans through to completion.
13. How might uncertainty about the future affect us?

Your answer


13 The uncertainties of life can be difficult to bear, a challenge. How so? We may worry about what might happen, and that could rob us of joy. Sudden tragedies and unforeseen occurrences can cause us grief and frustration. And when our expectations go unfulfilled, we can become disappointed and discouraged.​—Prov. 13:12.
14. On what does our lasting happiness depend? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


14 When we endure difficulties, we are able to prove that no matter what happens, we serve our heavenly Father out of love, not out of selfishness. Bible accounts show that we should not expect Jehovah to protect us from all hardship and that he does not predestine the events of our life. He knows that our happiness does not depend on our knowing what the future holds for us. Rather, it depends on seeking his guidance and obeying him. (Jer. 10:23) By looking to him when we make decisions, we are, in effect, saying: “If Jehovah wills, we will live and do this or that.”​—Jas. 4:15.




Seeking Jehovah’s guidance and obeying him provide reliable protection (See paragraphs 14-15)b




15. What do we know about the future?

Your answer


15 While we do not know what each new day will bring, we do know that Jehovah has promised us everlasting life​—whether in heaven or on earth. We know that he cannot lie and that nothing can prevent him from fulfilling all his promises. (Titus 1:2) He alone can “foretell the outcome, and from long ago the things that have not yet been done.” That was true of events in the past, and it will be true of future events. (Isa. 46:10) We know for a certainty that nothing can prevent Jehovah from loving us. (Rom. 8:35-39) He will give us the wisdom, comfort, and power we need to endure whatever comes our way. We can be sure that Jehovah will help and bless us.​—Jer. 17:7, 8.
WE CANNOT FULLY COMPREHEND HOW WELL JEHOVAH KNOWS US
16. As revealed at Psalm 139:1-6, what knowledge does Jehovah have that we cannot fully comprehend?

Your answer


16 Read Psalm 139:1-6. Our Creator knows how we are made and what has shaped us physically, emotionally, and mentally. His interest in us is constant. He knows what we say and what we mean to say, what we do and why we do it. As King David noted, Jehovah surrounds us with His watchful care and we are never out of His reach. How incredible that the Sovereign Lord of the universe, the almighty Creator of heaven and earth, pays such close attention to us! David said: “Such knowledge is too amazing for me. It is too much for me to fathom.”​—Ps. 139:6, ftn.
17. Why may we find it difficult to accept that Jehovah knows us so well?

Your answer


17 Perhaps because of our family background, our culture, or our previous beliefs, it may be difficult for us to see Jehovah as a loving Father who is interested in us. Or we might feel that our past mistakes are so bad that Jehovah would never want to know us and that he is far away from us. Even David at times had similar feelings. (Ps. 38:18, 21) Or a person who is sincerely trying to change his lifestyle and live by God’s righteous standards might wonder, ‘If God really understood me, why would he expect me to reject a way of life that feels so natural to me?’
18. How do we benefit by accepting that Jehovah knows us better than we know ourselves? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


18 We can learn to accept that Jehovah knows us better than we know ourselves and that he can see the good in us that we cannot see. Yet, though he sees flaws in us and understands why we feel and act the way we do, he loves us. (Rom. 7:15) When we come to appreciate deeply that Jehovah sees the potential in us, we can increase the confidence we need to serve him faithfully and to do so with joy.




Jehovah helps us to face the uncertainties of life in this system by strengthening our confidence in the joyful time that awaits us in the new world (See paragraphs 18-19)c




19. What do we know with certainty about Jehovah?

Your answer


19 We know that Jehovah is love. There is absolutely no doubt about that. (1 John 4:8) We know that his righteous standards reflect his love for us and that he always has our best interests at heart. We know that Jehovah wants us to gain everlasting life. He provided the ransom to make that possible. The gift of the ransom assures us that we can succeed despite our imperfections. (Rom. 7:24, 25) And we know that “God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.” (1 John 3:19, 20) Jehovah sees everything about us, and he has confidence that we can succeed in doing his will.
20. What will help us to avoid undue anxiety?

Your answer


20 Jehovah has not deprived us of any information that we really need to have. When we modestly accept that fact, we avoid undue anxiety over what we cannot control and we can focus on what really matters. In doing so, we demonstrate that our full trust is in Jehovah, “the One perfect in knowledge.” (Job 36:4) While our understanding of some matters is limited now, we look forward to an eternity of learning new things from and about our Grand God.​—Eccl. 3:11.
