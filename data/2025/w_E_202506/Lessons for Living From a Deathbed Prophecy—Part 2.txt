Lessons for Living From a Deathbed Prophecy​—Part 2


“He gave each of them an appropriate blessing.”​—GEN. 49:28.


FOCUS
Practical lessons from Jacob’s deathbed prophecy regarding eight of his sons.


 1. What part of Jacob’s deathbed prophecy will we discuss in this article?

Your answer


JACOB’S sons are gathered around him, listening carefully as their elderly father blesses each of them. As discussed in the preceding article, Jacob’s words to Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah intrigued​—and perhaps even surprised—​his sons. So they must be wondering what Jacob will say to his remaining eight sons. Let us see what lessons we can learn from his words to Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, and Benjamin.a
ZEBULUN
 2. Describe Zebulun’s blessing and how it was fulfilled. (Genesis 49:13) (See also box.)

Your answer


2 Read Genesis 49:13. Jacob indicates that Zebulun’s descendants would live by the seashore, toward the north of the Promised Land. Over 200 years later, the Zebulunites did receive a territorial inheritance that was located between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean. Moses prophesied: “Rejoice, O Zebulun, in your going out.” (Deut. 33:18) This may have been a reference to the fact that Zebulun would have easy access to commercial trade because of being located between the two seas. Whatever the case, the descendants of Zebulun had reason to be happy.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Zebulun

Pronouncement

“Zebulun will reside by the seashore . . . His remote border will be toward Sidon.”​—Gen. 49:13.

Fulfillment

Zebulun resided in the north between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean.​—Josh. 19:10-16.





 3. What can help us to be content?

Your answer


3 What can we learn? We have reason to be happy, no matter where we live or what our circumstances may be. To remain happy, we must be content with what we have. (Ps. 16:6; 24:5) Sometimes it can be easier to focus on what we do not have rather than on the good things that we do enjoy. So try to see the positive in your circumstances.​—Gal. 6:4.
ISSACHAR
 4. Describe Issachar’s blessing and how it was fulfilled. (Genesis 49:14, 15) (See also box.)

Your answer


4 Read Genesis 49:14, 15. Jacob commends Issachar for being a hard worker by favorably comparing him to a strong-boned donkey​—an animal that can carry heavy loads. Jacob also says that Issachar would have a pleasant land. In harmony with Jacob’s words, the descendants of Issachar received a productive and fertile allotment of land by the Jordan River. (Josh. 19:22) No doubt they worked hard to cultivate their land, but they also worked hard for the benefit of others. (1 Ki. 4:7, 17) For example, the tribe of Issachar was ready to do its share in fighting the nation’s battles, as was the case during the time of Judge Barak and the prophetess Deborah.​—Judg. 5:15
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Issachar

Pronouncement

“He will bend his shoulder to bear the burden.”​—Gen. 49:14, 15.

Fulfillment

Issachar worked hard for the benefit of the nation.​—Judg. 5:15; 1 Ki. 4:1, 7, 17.





 5. Why should we strive to be hard workers?

Your answer


5 What can we learn? Jehovah values our hard work in his service just as he valued the hard work of the tribe of Issachar. (Eccl. 2:24) Consider, for example, the brothers who work hard caring for the congregation. (1 Tim. 3:1) These brothers do not have to fight literal battles, but they must exert themselves to protect God’s people from spiritual dangers. (1 Cor. 5:1, 5; Jude 17-23) They also work hard to prepare and present encouraging talks that will strengthen the congregation.​—1 Tim. 5:17.
DAN
 6. What assignment did the tribe of Dan receive? (Genesis 49:17, 18) (See also box.)

Your answer


6 Read Genesis 49:17, 18. Jacob likens Dan to a snake that takes on adversaries much bigger than itself, such as a warhorse and its rider. Dan would prove dangerous to Israel’s enemies. During their trek to the Promised Land, the tribe of Dan protected the nation by “forming the rear guard.” (Num. 10:25) That was an important assignment, even though the Danites were not carrying it out in full view of the rest of the nation.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Dan

Pronouncement

“Dan . . . bites the heels of the horse.”​—Gen. 49:16-18.

Fulfillment

Dan was “the rear guard” on the march to the Promised Land.​—Num. 10:25.





 7. What is true of any theocratic assignment we care for?

Your answer


7 What can we learn? Have you ever cared for an assignment that appeared to go unnoticed by others? Perhaps you helped to clean and maintain the Kingdom Hall, volunteered to work at an assembly or a convention, or cared for another task. If so, you are to be commended! Always remember that Jehovah notices and values everything you do for him. He especially appreciates it when you serve him, not because you are looking to receive praise from others, but because you want to express your sincere love for him.​—Matt. 6:1-4.
GAD
 8. What made Gad vulnerable to attack in the Promised Land? (Genesis 49:19) (See also box.)

Your answer


8 Read Genesis 49:19. Jacob foretold that a marauder band would raid Gad. More than two centuries later, the tribe of Gad came to occupy a land east of the Jordan River​—a land that bordered enemy nations. This location made the tribe vulnerable to attack. Yet, the Gadites wanted to dwell there because it provided suitable pasturage for their livestock. (Num. 32:1, 5) The Gadites were evidently courageous people. More than that, they trusted that Jehovah would help them to defend their God-given land against any marauder band. They even sent their military forces away for years to help the other tribes conquer the rest of the Promised Land west of the Jordan. (Num. 32:16-19) They trusted that Jehovah would protect their wives and children while the men were away. Jehovah blessed them for their courage and self-sacrifice.​—Josh. 22:1-4.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Gad

Pronouncement

“A marauder band will raid him.”​—Gen. 49:19.

Fulfillment

Gad dwelt east of the Jordan, a location vulnerable to attack.​—Josh. 13:24-28.





 9. How will trust in Jehovah affect our life choices?

Your answer


9 What can we learn? To serve Jehovah in the face of challenges, we must continue to trust in him. (Ps. 37:3) Many today show their trust in Jehovah by making sacrifices to support theocratic construction projects, to serve where the need is greater, or to care for other assignments. They do so because they are confident that Jehovah will always care for them.​—Ps. 23:1.
ASHER
10. What did Asher fail to do? (Genesis 49:20) (See also box.)

Your answer


10 Read Genesis 49:20. Jacob foretold that the tribe of Asher would become prosperous, and this is exactly what happened. Asher’s tribal allotment included some of the most fertile land in all of Israel. (Deut. 33:24) It also bordered the Mediterranean Sea and included the wealthy Phoenician trading port of Sidon. However, Asher failed to drive out the Canaanites from the land. (Judg. 1:31, 32) The bad influence of the Canaanites coupled with Asher’s prosperity may have caused the tribe to become less zealous for pure worship. Asher did not respond when Judge Barak looked for volunteers to fight a Canaanite coalition. As a result, the tribe missed out on sharing in the miraculous victory “by the waters of Megiddo.” (Judg. 5:19-21) It must have shamed Asher to hear Barak and Deborah’s inspired victory song, which included the lyric: “Asher sat idle at the seashore.”​—Judg. 5:17.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Asher

Pronouncement

“Asher’s bread will be abundant.”​—Gen. 49:20.

Fulfillment

Asher enjoyed prosperity in the Promised Land.​—Deut. 33:24.





11. Why do we need to maintain a balanced view of material things?

Your answer


11 What can we learn? We want to give Jehovah our best. To do so, we need to reject the world’s view of material comforts and possessions. (Prov. 18:11) We strive to maintain a balanced view of money. (Eccl. 7:12; Heb. 13:5) We do not allow the pursuit of unnecessary material things to hold us back in our service to God. Instead, we seek to give Jehovah the best of our time and energy now, knowing that a truly comfortable and secure life awaits us in the future.​—Ps. 4:8.
NAPHTALI
12. How may Naphtali’s blessing have proved true? (Genesis 49:21) (See also box.)

Your answer


12 Read Genesis 49:21. The “words of elegance” that Jacob mentioned may well refer to the way Jesus spoke during his ministry. Jesus, who was known for his effective teaching, made Capernaum in the territory of Naphtali “his own city.” (Matt. 4:13; 9:1; John 7:46) Of Jesus, Isaiah prophesied that the people of Zebulun and Naphtali would see “a great light.” (Isa. 9:1, 2) Jesus was “the true light that gives light to every sort of man” by means of his teaching.​—John 1:9.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Naphtali

Pronouncement

“He is speaking words of elegance.”​—Gen. 49:21.

Fulfillment

Jesus based his ministry in the territory of Naphtali.​—Matt. 4:13; 9:1.





13. How can we make sure that our speech pleases Jehovah?

Your answer


13 What can we learn? What we say and how we say it matters to Jehovah. How can we speak with “words of elegance” that please Jehovah? We can speak truthfully. (Ps. 15:1, 2) We can build others up with what we say by being quick to commend but slow to criticize or complain. (Eph. 4:29) And we can set the goal of becoming more skillful at starting conversations that could lead to giving a witness.
JOSEPH
14. Explain how Joseph’s blessing proved true. (Genesis 49:22, 26) (See also box.)

Your answer


14 Read Genesis 49:22, 26. Jacob must have been very proud of Joseph​—he was “singled out from his brothers.” Jacob called him “the offshoot of a fruitful tree.” Jacob himself was the tree, and Joseph was an offshoot of his. Joseph was the firstborn son of Jacob’s beloved wife, Rachel. Jacob indicated that Joseph would receive the double portion that Reuben​—Jacob’s firstborn from his wife Leah—​had forfeited. (Gen. 48:5, 6; 1 Chron. 5:1, 2) In the fulfillment of that prophecy, the descendants of Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, received an allotment of land as two separate tribes.​—Gen. 49:25; Josh. 14:4.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Joseph

Pronouncement

The blessings “will continue upon . . . the one singled out from his brothers.”​—Gen. 49:22-26.

Fulfillment

Joseph received the right of firstborn, and his two sons became two separate tribes.​—Josh. 14:4; 1 Chron. 5:1, 2.





15. How did Joseph react to injustice?

Your answer


15 Jacob also mentioned archers who “shot at [Joseph] and kept harboring animosity against him.” (Gen. 49:23) These were his once envious brothers, who were responsible for many of the injustices that he had experienced. Yet, Joseph did not become bitter toward his brothers or toward Jehovah. As Jacob put it: “[Joseph’s] bow remained in place, and his hands stayed strong and agile.” (Gen. 49:24) Joseph relied on Jehovah during his trials, and he not only forgave his brothers but also treated them kindly. (Gen. 47:11, 12) Joseph allowed the trials he faced to refine him. (Ps. 105:17-19) As a result, Jehovah was able to use him in a mighty way.
16. How can we imitate Joseph’s example when reacting to trials?

Your answer


16 What can we learn? May we never allow trials to distance us from Jehovah or from our fellow worshippers. Remember that Jehovah may permit tests of faith to be part of our training. (Heb. 12:7, ftn.) This training can help us to cultivate and refine Christian qualities, such as mercy and forgiveness. (Heb. 12:11) Jehovah will reward us for our endurance, as he did Joseph.
BENJAMIN
17. How was Benjamin’s prophetic blessing fulfilled? (Genesis 49:27) (See also box.)

Your answer


17 Read Genesis 49:27. Jacob foretold that the Benjaminites would have great fighting ability like a wolf. (Judg. 20:15, 16; 1 Chron. 12:2) It was “in the morning” of the kingdom of Israel that the tribe of Benjamin provided Israel’s first king, Saul. He proved to be a fierce fighter against the Philistines. (1 Sam. 9:15-17, 21) “In the evening” of that royal history, Queen Esther and Prime Minister Mordecai, both Benjaminites, saved the Israelites from annihilation under the Persian Empire.​—Esther 2:5-7; 8:3; 10:3.
Jacob’s Deathbed Prophecy







Son

Benjamin

Pronouncement

“In the morning he will eat the prey, and in the evening he will divide spoil.”​—Gen. 49:27.

Fulfillment

Saul was Israel’s first king. (1 Sam. 9:15-17) Later, Esther and Mordecai saved Jehovah’s people.​—Esther 2:5-7; 8:3; 10:3.





18. How can we imitate Benjamin’s loyalty to Jehovah’s arrangements?

Your answer


18 What can we learn? The Benjaminites were no doubt proud to see one of their own become king in fulfillment of the blessing. However, when Jehovah transferred the kingship to David of the tribe of Judah, the Benjaminites eventually supported that change. (2 Sam. 3:17-19) Decades later when the other tribes rebelled, the Benjaminites loyally stuck to Judah and Jehovah’s appointed king. (1 Ki. 11:31, 32; 12:19, 21) May we too loyally support those whom Jehovah designates to lead his people today.​—1 Thess. 5:12.
19. How can we benefit from Jacob’s deathbed prophecy?

Your answer


19 Jacob’s deathbed prophecy can benefit us. Reviewing how it was fulfilled strengthens our faith in the reliability of Jehovah’s prophetic Word. And considering how Jacob’s sons were blessed helps us to understand better how we can please Jehovah.
