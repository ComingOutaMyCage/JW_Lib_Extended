Remembering Scriptures




Have you ever struggled to recall a favorite Bible verse? It could be one that comforts you, that helps you overcome wrong thoughts, or that you want to share with someone. (Ps. 119:11, 111) Consider some suggestions that can help you remember scriptures.
  Use the tag feature in the JW Library® app. Create a tag labeled “Favorite Scriptures,” and save any scriptures that you want to remember in this section.

  Post the scripture where you can see it. Write down on a piece of paper the verse you want to remember, and put it where you will see it often. Some put it by their mirror; others put it on their refrigerator door. Still others take a picture of the scripture and use the picture as a screen saver on their computer or on their mobile device.

  Make and use flash cards. Write the scripture citation on one side and the text on the other side. Then try to quote the scripture using the citation or recall where it is located using the text.
