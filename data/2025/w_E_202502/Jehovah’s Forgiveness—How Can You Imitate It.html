<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>DO YOU find it difficult to forgive others? Many of us do, especially when someone says or does something that hurts us deeply. However, we can overcome our hurt feelings and be forgiving. For example, consider the experience of a sister named Denise,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> who showed extraordinary forgiveness. In 2017, Denise and her family had just visited the newly opened World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses. While they were on their way home, another driver lost control of his car and hit their vehicle. Denise lost consciousness in the accident. When she woke up, she learned that her children were badly injured and that her husband, Brian, had been killed. Reflecting on that moment, Denise says, “I felt broken and confused.” Later, she learned that the driver had not been impaired or distracted, and she prayed to Jehovah for peace.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The driver who hit them was charged with manslaughter. If convicted, he could be imprisoned. However, the court informed Denise that the outcome of the man’s sentencing depended on her testimony. Denise says: “I felt as if somebody had cut open my stitches and dumped a gallon of salt in my wound, as I had to relive the worst moments of my life.” Just a few weeks later, Denise sat in a courtroom and prepared to address the man who had <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>caused her family so much pain. What did she say? Denise asked the judge to show mercy to the man.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> When she finished speaking, the judge broke down in tears. He said: “In all my 25 years as a judge, I have never heard anything like this in my courtroom. I never hear the victim’s family plead for mercy in behalf of the defendant. I never hear words of love and forgiveness.”</p>

The Bible acknowledges that we may become wrathful. However, it warns against allowing that emotion to dominate us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:4:4-19:4:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 4:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:26-49:4:26" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:26</a>) Why?

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[54]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> When we have been treated badly, we might feel other painful emotions. For example, a sister named Ann says: “When I was a child, my dad left my mom and married my nanny. I felt abandoned. When they had children, I felt replaced. I grew up feeling unwanted.” A sister named Georgette describes how she felt when her husband was unfaithful to her: “We had been friends since childhood. We were pioneer partners! My heart was broken.” And a sister named Naomi says: “I never imagined that my husband would hurt me. So when he confessed that he had been viewing pornography and hiding it from me, I felt deceived and betrayed.”</p>

And often the best response is to forgive. Why? Because we love Jehovah, and he wants us to be forgiving. If we remain angry and do not forgive, we are likely to act foolishly and perhaps suffer physically. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:17-20:14:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 14:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:29-20:14:30" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 29, 30</a>) Note the example of a sister named Christine. She says: “When I am consumed by my hurt feelings, I smile less. I tend to make poor food choices. I don’t get enough sleep, and it’s more difficult to control my emotions, which in turn affects my marriage and my relationships with others.”</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p82" data-pid="82">We do well to remember that when we forgive someone, we are not condoning that person’s actions or allowing him to take advantage of us. Instead, we decide to let go of our resentment and anger. In that way, we do not allow the person who caused us trauma to continue to victimize us. By letting go of our resentment, we are really giving ourselves a gift. It allows us to heal and move on with our life. Of course, even when we decide to let go of our resentment and anger, we need never forget that the person is still accountable to Jehovah for what he has done. Thus, in a sense, letting go of our resentment and anger is another way in which we follow the psalmist’s inspired advice: “Throw your burden on Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22</a>) We leave the matter with Jehovah, trusting that he will judge the person who deeply hurt us. And Jehovah judges matters far better than we can. So he will provide a more just outcome than we could ever hope to achieve on our own.</p>

How? Georgette, mentioned earlier, says: “It took some time, but I let go of my resentment and anger toward my ex-husband. As a result, I felt immense peace.” When we let go of resentment, we prevent our heart from becoming damaged by bitterness. We also give ourselves a gift​—we can start to move on and enjoy our life once again.
