<p id="p2" data-pid="2">HAVE you noticed that many people in the world feel that they are entitled to special privileges, rights, or treatment? No matter how much they get, they believe that they deserve more. This thinking is rooted in the selfish and unthankful attitudes that mark the last days.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:2-55:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Of course, selfishness is not new. Adam and Eve decided to choose for themselves what was good and what was bad, with disastrous consequences. Centuries later, King Uzziah of Judah thought that he was entitled to present incense at the temple, but he was badly mistaken. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:26:18-14:26:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:18, 19</a>) Similarly, the Pharisees and Sadducees believed that they deserved God’s special favor just because they descended from Abraham.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:9-40:3:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 3:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">We are surrounded by people who are selfish and egotistical, and their attitude could influence us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 5:26</a>) We might start to think that we deserve to receive a certain privilege or get special treatment. How can we avoid this way of thinking? To begin, we should get Jehovah’s view of the matter. Two Bible principles will help us.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Jehovah determines what we should receive.</strong> Consider some examples.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6">  In the family arrangement, a husband needs to feel respected by his wife and a <span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>wife needs to feel loved by her husband. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 5:33</a>) Marriage mates should receive the exclusive romantic interest of their spouse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:3</a>) Parents rightly require the obedience of their children, and children should receive ample love and support from their parents.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:14-47:12:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:2-49:6:2" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eph. 6:2</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Beware of the world’s attitude.</strong> Without realizing it, we might begin to think that we deserve more than others. Jesus showed how easily such thinking can arise by using the illustration of the workers who were paid a denarius. Some workers started early in the morning and worked all day under the hot sun; others worked for just one hour. The first group assumed that they were entitled to a higher wage because of the work they had done. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:1-40:20:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 20:1-16</a>) In applying this illustration, Jesus showed that his followers should be satisfied with what God is pleased to provide.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:11-46:9:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:11-14</a>) We should appreciate each blessing that we receive and avoid a demanding spirit.</p>
