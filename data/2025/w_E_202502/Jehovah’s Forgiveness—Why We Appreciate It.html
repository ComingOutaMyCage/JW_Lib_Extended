One day tragedy strikes; his parents are killed in an accident. The news is devastating to him. However, another shock awaits this young man. He learns that his parents squandered the family fortune and that they acquired huge debts. Now imagine that instead of inheriting their wealth, he inherits their debts, and creditors are demanding payment. The debt is far beyond his ability ever to repay.</p>

But thanks to Jehovah, we have help. Our situation has changed because of the atonement arrangement and the payment of the ransom. Our faith in Jesus Christ allows us to be redeemed, or set free, from sin and death. Our sins can also be canceled, and our criminal record, erased. Most important of all, though, we can now have a good relationship with our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah.</p>
