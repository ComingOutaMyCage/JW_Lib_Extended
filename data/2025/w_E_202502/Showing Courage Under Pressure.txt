STUDY PROJECT
Showing Courage Under Pressure




Read Jeremiah 38:1-13 to learn about the courage shown by the prophet Jeremiah and the eunuch Ebed-melech.
Analyze the context. How did Jeremiah show courage in declaring Jehovah’s message? (Jer. 27:12-14; 28:15-17; 37:6-10) What reaction did that provoke?​—Jer. 37:15, 16.
Dig deeper. What pressure did Jeremiah face? (jr 26-27 ¶20-22) Find out what you can about ancient cisterns. (it-1 471) What emotions might Jeremiah have experienced while in the muddy cistern? What fears might Ebed-melech have had to overcome?​—w12 5/1 31 ¶2-3.
Identify the lessons. Ask yourself:
  ‘What does this account teach me about the way Jehovah protects his loyal servants?’ (Ps. 97:10; Jer. 39:15-18)

  ‘In what situations will I need to show courage?’

  ‘How can I strengthen my courage to do what is right when under pressure?’ (w11 3/1 30)a
