Maintain Your Daily Bible Reading Schedule


With so many activities to care for, do you struggle to follow your schedule for reading God’s Word each day? (Josh. 1:8) If so, try one of these suggestions:
  Set up daily reminders. Set an alarm on your electronic device to prompt you to read the Bible.

  Keep your Bible in a prominent place. If you read from a printed copy of the Bible, put it where you can easily see it every day.​—Deut. 11:18.

  Listen to audio recordings. Listen to these as you do routine activities. Tara, a pioneer and a mother who works a night shift, says, “Listening to the audio Bible while doing household chores helps me keep my Bible reading consistent.”

  Persevere. If unexpected circumstances disrupt your plan, read at least a few Bible verses before going to bed. Even a little bit every day goes a long way.​—1 Pet. 2:2.
