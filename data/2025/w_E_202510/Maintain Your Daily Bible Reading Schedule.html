<p id="p3" data-pid="3">With so many activities to care for, do you struggle to follow your schedule for reading God’s Word each day? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) If so, try one of these suggestions:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4">  <strong>Set up daily reminders.</strong> Set an alarm on your electronic device to prompt you to read the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5">  <strong>Keep your Bible in a prominent place.</strong> If you read from a printed copy of the Bible, put it where you can easily see it every day.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:18-5:11:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 11:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6">  <strong>Listen to audio recordings.</strong> Listen to these as you do routine activities. Tara, a pioneer and a mother who works a night shift, says, “Listening to the audio Bible while doing household chores helps me keep my Bible reading consistent.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7">  <strong>Persevere.</strong> If unexpected circumstances disrupt your plan, read at least a few Bible verses before going to bed. Even a little bit every day goes a long way.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:2</a>.</p>
