But we are not without help. At such times, God’s holy spirit “pleads” for us. How so? Through his spirit, Jehovah caused many prayers to be preserved in his Word. When we cannot clearly express our thoughts, Jehovah may accept certain expressions found in those prayers as requests that we wish to make, and he may answer them.</p>

She was arrested for praying and for reading the Bible. Yelena experienced so much stress that she found it difficult to pray. She relates: “I then remembered that when I feel overwhelmed and do not know what to pray for, Jehovah will accept the inspired prayers of God’s servants from the past . . . as requests I would like to make. . . . This proved to be very comforting to me during an extremely difficult time.”</p>

To prepare our mind, we can listen to audio recordings of the Psalms. We can also try to pour out our feelings in writing, as King David did.
