<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Another way you can be anchored during a trial is to think of Jehovah’s love as a basic Bible teaching. What does the phrase “basic Bible teaching” mean to you? Perhaps you think of the doctrinal truths that you have learned from God’s Word. For example, you have learned that God’s name is Jehovah, that Jesus is God’s only-begotten Son, that the dead are unconscious, and that there will be an earthly paradise in which humans will live forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Eccl. 9:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:3, 4</a>) Once you accepted those teachings, you were not easily swayed. Why? Because you came to realize that they are rooted in facts. Let us see how viewing Jehovah’s love as a basic Bible teaching can help you to dispel the thought that Jehovah does not care about or notice what you are going through.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> When you first studied the Bible, what helped you to reject false teachings? Likely, you were helped by comparing what you were taught by your religion with what the Scriptures teach. Consider one example: Suppose you once believed that Jesus is Almighty God. As you studied the Bible, though, you asked yourself, ‘Is that teaching really true?’ After examining the Scriptural evidence, you were able to answer no. Then you replaced the <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>false teaching with this Scriptural truth: Jesus is “the firstborn of all creation,” “the only-begotten Son of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Col. 1:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:18-43:3:18" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 3:18</a>) Of course, false teachings can be “strongly entrenched” and difficult to overturn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:4-47:10:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:4, 5</a>) But once you were able to do so, you did not return to the doctrines that you left behind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:13-50:3:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Phil. 3:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> You can take a similar approach regarding what the Bible teaches about Jehovah’s love. As you face a trial, if you begin to doubt Jehovah’s love, ask yourself, ‘Is my thinking sound?’ Compare your doubts about Jehovah’s love with the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:136:1-19:136:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 136:1</a>​—the theme scripture for this article. Why does Jehovah describe his love as “loyal”? Why is the thought that “his loyal love endures forever” repeated 26 times in that psalm? As we have considered, Jehovah’s loyal love for his people is a fundamental Bible teaching, much like other doctrines that you have readily accepted from God’s Word. The idea that Jehovah views you as worthless or unlovable is a falsehood. Reject that belief, just as firmly as you would reject any other false teaching!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The Bible contains many other assurances of Jehovah’s love. For example, Jesus said to his followers: “You are worth more than many sparrows.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:31-40:10:31" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 10:31</a>) Jehovah himself said to his people: “I will fortify you, yes, I will help you, I will really hold on to you with my right hand of righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 41:10</a>) Note how firm those statements are. Jesus does not say ‘You might be worth more,’ and Jehovah does not say ‘I might help you.’ Rather, they say: “You <strong><em>are</em></strong> worth more” and “I <strong><em>will</em></strong> help you.” If you ever doubt Jehovah’s love as you face a trial, such scriptures can do more than just help you <strong><em>feel</em></strong> better; they can help you <strong><em>know</em></strong> better. They are rooted in facts. Prayerfully meditating on that will move you to echo the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 John 4:16</a>: “We have come to <strong><em>know and believe</em></strong> the love that God has for us.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

After his resurrection, the disciples might have been inclined to pray to Jesus. After all, they had come to know Jesus as a friend. They could have reasoned that his affection for them would move him to hear their entreaties and present their requests to the Father. However, Jesus said that they should not think this way. Why? Because, he told them: “The Father <strong><em>himself</em></strong> has affection for you.” That fact is part of the Bible’s basic teaching about prayer. Consider what that means for you: Through your study of the Bible, you have come to know and to love Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 14:21</a>) But like the first-century disciples, you can confidently pray to God, knowing that he <strong>“<em>himself</em></strong> has affection for you.” You demonstrate your faith in those words each time you pray to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>.</p>
