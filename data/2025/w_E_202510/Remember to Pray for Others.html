(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:11-19:91:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 91:11</a>) He has also given his Son weighty responsibilities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18</a>) However, what about listening to prayers? That is something Jehovah has reserved for himself alone.

Yes, it can. Jesus, knowing that the apostle Peter would soon deny him, said: “I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:32-42:22:32" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 22:32</a>) Paul also knew that prayer can make a difference. When he was unjustly imprisoned in Rome, he wrote to Philemon: “I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given back to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/57:1:22-57:1:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Philem. 22</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070161/1:22">study note</a> “for I am hoping that through your prayers.”) As it turned out, Paul was soon freed and was able to resume his preaching.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Of course, this does not mean that by praying we can put pressure on Jehovah. He notices the concern that his servants show, and he at times chooses to act on their request.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:15-47:12:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:15</a>) For example, a circuit overseer named Mark says: “One of my greatest challenges is being far away from my aging parents.

Although their needs <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>are being cared for by my sister and her husband, it pains me to be so limited in what I can do for them personally.” Whether we are aware of the anxieties that these hardworking brothers are dealing with or not, we do well to keep them in our prayers.
