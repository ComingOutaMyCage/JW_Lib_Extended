Because we are living in “the last days,” we expect to encounter situations and face emotions that are “hard to deal with.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>.</p>

We can easily be robbed of our joy when facing such problems, especially when we have little or no control over a situation. The Bible realistically acknowledges that “heartache crushes the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:13-20:15:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 15:13</a>) Babis, an elder who lost his brother and both of his parents in death within a four-year period, says: “I felt alone and helpless.

The world promotes the idea that our life has to be picture-perfect for us to be happy. But this is not true. For example, Jehovah instructed the Jewish exiles in Babylon to accept their new reality as captives in a foreign land and to do their best under those difficult circumstances. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:4-24:29:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Jeremiah</strong> <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span><strong>29:4-7,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:10-24:29:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>10</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The lesson? Try to accept your circumstances, and be grateful for the good things in your life. Remember, Jehovah will help you along the way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:63:7-19:63:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 63:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:5-19:146:5" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 146:5</a>) Effie, who was in an accident that left her paralyzed, says: “I received a lot of help and support from Jehovah, my family, and the congregation. So I felt that it would be ungrateful of me if I just gave up. I want to show my gratitude to Jehovah and to the friends for their immense help.”</p>

Because our joy does not depend on our circumstances. Maria, a pioneer, says: “When you are faced with problems, staying joyful does not mean that you are suppressing your feelings. Rather, it means that you have not forgotten Jehovah’s promises. Our Father will help us to protect our joy.” Remember, no matter how hard things are now, all our problems are temporary​—like footprints on a beach.

However, if the goals we set are not realistic for our circumstances, we could become downhearted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:22-20:17:22" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 17:22</a>) A pioneer named Holly says: “I wanted to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, to serve abroad, or to work on the Ramapo construction project.

Would it be reasonable for us to expect more of ourselves than Jehovah does?<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Certainly not! So if your circumstances limit what you can do in Jehovah’s service, try focusing on what is within your reach. Could you become a mentor for younger ones or a strengthening aid for older ones? Could you set the goal of encouraging someone in person, by phone, or even by means of a text message? Jehovah will bless you with joy as you work toward such meaningful and realistic goals! And keep in mind that very soon, we will have endless opportunities in Jehovah’s new world to serve him in ways we cannot even imagine! Holly, mentioned earlier, concluded: “I sit back and think to myself, ‘I have eternity.’ With Jehovah’s help, I can fulfill some of my goals in the new world.”</p>

Jehovah has created us in a way that we can appreciate beautiful things. However, many have found that what they thought would bring them joy actually robbed them of it.

You may not be able to solve his problems, but you can comfort him by listening with empathy, by being compassionate, and by reminding him to throw his burden on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:19-19:68:19" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 68:19</a>) You can also help him to appreciate that Jehovah has not abandoned him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 37:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Isa. 59:1</a>) You might even offer to do something practical for him, such as prepare a meal or just go for a walk together. Invite him to join you in the ministry, which will lift his spirits. Allow yourself to be a tool in Jehovah’s hands. Focusing on others rather than on ourselves will give us genuine joy!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:25-20:11:25" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 11:25</a>.</p>
