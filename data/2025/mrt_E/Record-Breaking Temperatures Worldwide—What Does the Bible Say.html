<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>During July 2022, record-breaking temperatures were reported worldwide:</p>
<ul><li><blockquote><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>           “China issues highest heat alert for almost 70 cities in second heatwave this month.”—July 25, 2022, CNN Wire Service.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>           “Forest fires rage across Europe as heatwave sends temperatures soaring.”—July 17, 2022, <em>The Guardian.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>            “Cities across the United States set temperature records on Sunday as a summer heat wave spread across the East Coast and parts of the South and Midwest.”—July 24, 2022, <em>The New York Times.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>What does all this mean? Will the earth eventually become unfit for life? What does the Bible say?</p>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Do heat waves fulfill Bible prophecy?</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Yes. Global heat waves fit events that the Bible foretold for our time. For example, Jesus prophesied that we would see “fearful sights,” or “strange and terrifying things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>; <em>Good News Translation</em>) Rising global temperatures have led many to fear that mankind will ruin the earth.</p>
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Will the earth become unlivable?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>No. God created the earth to be mankind’s permanent home. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:16-19:115:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 115:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:4-21:1:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>) Rather than allow humans to destroy it, he will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth,” as he has promised.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 11:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Consider just two prophecies that show what else God has promised:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>            “The wilderness and the parched land will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1</a>) God will not let the earth become an unlivable desert, but he will restore its damaged areas.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>            “You care for the earth, making it abundantly fruitful and very rich.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:9-19:65:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 65:9</a>) With God’s blessing, the earth will become a paradise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
