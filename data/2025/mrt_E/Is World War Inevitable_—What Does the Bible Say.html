<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>During the past 30 years, many people have felt that the international order was stable and even improving. However, that view is being challenged by recent events.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Does the Bible say anything about the international instability that we are seeing today? Will it lead to world war?</p>
<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>The Bible foretold current events</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The Bible did not foretell any <em>specific</em> war that we are seeing today. However, it did foretell the rampant warfare that is marking our time and is taking “peace away from the earth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:4-66:6:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 6:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The book of Daniel foretold that “in the time of the end,” competing world powers would engage in a “pushing,” or struggle for dominance. That struggle would involve projecting great military power and spending vast “treasures,” or financial resources.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:40-27:11:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 11:40,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:42-27:11:43" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 42, 43</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>A war that is coming</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The Bible indicates that the world situation will get worse before it gets better. Jesus foretold that “there [would] be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>) That “great tribulation” will culminate in a war called Armageddon, which is described as “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>However, Armageddon will <em>save</em> mankind, not destroy it. By means of that war, God will bring an end to human rulership, which has caused so many destructive wars. To find out how Armageddon will result in lasting peace, read the following articles:</p>
