<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>       “Since the 7th of October, the world has seen a sharp and worrying increase in hate, hate speech and hate crimes.”​—Dennis Francis, president of the United Nations General Assembly, November 3, 2023.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Hateful speech, violence, and war are not new. In fact, the Bible describes those in the past who “[aimed] their cruel words like arrows” and who pursued war and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:64:3-19:64:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 64:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:120:7-19:120:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 120:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:140:1-19:140:1" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 140:1</a>) Yet the Bible explains that the hatred we see today is significant.</p>
<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Hatred​—A mark of our times</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The Bible reveals two reasons why hate is common today.</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su"><span class="txtSrcBullet"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>1. </span>It <a class="xt" data-xtid="76" href="jwpub://p/E:502016185/">foretold a time period</a> when “the love of the greater number will grow cold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:12-40:24:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:12</a>) Instead of love, people in general would display attitudes that foster hatred.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su"><span class="txtSrcBullet"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>2. </span>The level of hatred today reflects the malicious and wicked influence of Satan the Devil. The Bible says that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>However, the Bible also reveals that God will soon eliminate the root causes of hatred. What is more, he will undo all the suffering that hate has caused. The Bible promises:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>       God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>
