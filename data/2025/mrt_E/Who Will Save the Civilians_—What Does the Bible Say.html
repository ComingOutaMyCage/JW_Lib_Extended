<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>As reported by the United Nations:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">          <span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>       From October 7 to October 23, 2023, the Gaza-Israel conflict has resulted in more than 6,400 killed and 15,200 injured, most of whom were civilians.

</ul>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>What hope does the Bible offer for those who suffer from war?</p>
<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>A reason for hope</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The Bible foretells that God will bring “an end to wars throughout the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:9-19:46:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 46:9</a>) He will use a heavenly government, or kingdom, to replace all human governments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) God’s Kingdom will bring relief to mankind.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Note what Jesus Christ, the King of God’s Kingdom, will do:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>       “He will rescue the poor who cry for help, also the lowly one and whoever has no helper. He will have pity on the lowly and the poor, and the lives of the poor he will save. From oppression and from violence he will rescue them.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 72:12-14</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>By means of his Kingdom, God will completely undo the misery and suffering caused by warfare and violence.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>       “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Soon God’s Kingdom will intervene in earth’s affairs. The Bible foretold the “wars and reports of wars” that we see happening today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:6-40:24:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 24:6</a>) These and other events indicate that <a class="xt" data-xtid="76" href="jwpub://p/E:502016185/">we are living in “the last days” of human rulership</a>.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>
