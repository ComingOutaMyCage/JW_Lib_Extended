War—What God’s Kingdom Will Do


The world continues to be ravaged by wars that are causing untold pain and suffering. Note the following reports:
               “New figures show conflict-related deaths at 28-year high, largely due to Ethiopia and Ukraine wars.”—Peace Research Institute Oslo, June 7, 2023.

             “The war in Ukraine was just one of the conflicts that escalated in 2022. Overall, political violence increased by 27% globally last year, with an estimated 1.7 billion people exposed to its effects.”— The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), February 8, 2023.


The Bible offers hope. It says that “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed.” (Daniel 2:44) Under that Kingdom, or government, God will bring “an end to wars throughout the earth.”—Psalm 46:9.
