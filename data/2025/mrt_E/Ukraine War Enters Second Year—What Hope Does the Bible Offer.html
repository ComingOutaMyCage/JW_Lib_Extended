<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Friday, February 24, 2023, marks a grim anniversary—one year since the war in Ukraine began. According to some reports, about 300,000 Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded and about 30,000 civilians are believed to have died in the war. However, the total may be higher.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Sadly, an end to this war does not appear to be in sight.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>       “Nearly a year since Russian forces rolled into Ukraine, there are no real signs of a way out of the conflict. Neither side appears primed for an outright military victory, and progress at the negotiating table seems just as unlikely.”—NPR (National Public Radio), February 19, 2023.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Many people are rightly distressed by the pain and suffering that this and other conflicts are inflicting on innocent people around the world. What hope does the Bible offer? Will there ever be an end to war?</p>
<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>A war that will end all wars</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The Bible speaks of a war that will <em>save</em> mankind, not destroy it. That war is known as Armageddon, and it is described as “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16</a>) By means of that war, God will bring an end to human rulership, which has caused so many destructive wars. To learn how Armageddon will result in lasting peace, read the following articles:</p>
