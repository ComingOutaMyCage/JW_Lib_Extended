<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span> The Bible identifies someone you can trust: Jesus Christ. He was not just a good man who lived many centuries ago. God appointed Jesus to “rule as King . . . , and there will be no end to his Kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>) Jesus is King of God’s Kingdom, a government now ruling from heaven.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>       To learn why you can trust Jesus, read the articles “<a class="xt" data-xtid="209" href="jwpub://p/E:2020086/">Who Is the King of God’s Kingdom?</a>” and “<a class="xt" data-xtid="95" href="jwpub://p/E:2020088/">What Will God’s Kingdom Accomplish?</a>”</p>
