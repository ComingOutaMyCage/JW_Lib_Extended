</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>On October 9, 2024, the World Wildlife Fund released a sobering report about the effect of human activity on wildlife. It revealed that “over the past 50 years (1970-2020), the average size of monitored wildlife populations has shrunk by 73%.” The report warned: “It is no exaggeration to say that what happens in the next five years will determine the future of life on Earth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Many people are naturally shocked by such reports. We love our beautiful planet and hate to see its wildlife suffer. We feel this way because God intended for us to care for the animals.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:10-20:12:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Proverbs 12:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>So you may wonder, ‘Will we be able to protect the earth’s wildlife? What does the Bible say?’</p>
<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>A hope for the future</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Despite our best efforts, the future of the planet’s wildlife rests, not with us, but with God. The Bible foretells, according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 11:18</strong></a><strong>,</strong> that God will <strong>“bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”</strong> That verse teaches us two things:</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su"><span class="txtSrcBullet"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>1. </span>God will stop people from completely ruining or destroying the earth.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su"><span class="txtSrcBullet"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>2. </span>God will act soon. How do we know? Never before in history has the potential for mankind to destroy earth’s wildlife been so great.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>What will God do to solve this problem? He will use his heavenly government, or Kingdom, to rule over the entire earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>) That government will provide obedient humans with the education and training they need to care for and protect earth’s wildlife.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9</a>.</p>
