KEEP ON THE WATCH!
Whom Can You Trust?—⁠What Does the Bible Say?


People are disappointed when those who are supposed to be trustworthy let them down. Many have lost trust in . . .
             political leaders who put their own interests ahead of the needs of the people.

             media outlets that fail to report the news fairly and accurately.

              scientists who do not act in the public’s best interest.

              religious leaders who are deeply involved in supporting politics rather than in representing God.


People are right to be cautious about whom they trust. The Bible warns:
               “Don’t put your trust in human leaders; no human being can save you.”—Psalm 146:3, Good News Translation.


Someone you can trust
 The Bible identifies someone you can trust: Jesus Christ. He was not just a good man who lived many centuries ago. God appointed Jesus to “rule as King . . . , and there will be no end to his Kingdom.” (Luke 1:32, 33) Jesus is King of God’s Kingdom, a government now ruling from heaven.—Matthew 6:10.
              To learn why you can trust Jesus, read the articles “Who Is the King of God’s Kingdom?” and “What Will God’s Kingdom Accomplish?”
