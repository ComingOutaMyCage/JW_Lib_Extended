<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>On January 27, 2023, many people will observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The atrocities that occurred over 75 years ago may cause you to wonder why God allowed the Holocaust to happen.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>       To find out what the Bible says, read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="175" href="jwpub://p/E:502013209/">Why Did the Holocaust Happen? Why Didn’t God Stop It?</a>”</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Jewish people suffered terribly as victims of the Holocaust. Millions were systematically murdered. Members of other groups were also targeted and killed during the time of the Holocaust. Among them were Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were persecuted for their Bible-based beliefs.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Many people fear that an event such as the Holocaust could occur again. Thankfully, the Bible points to a future when such tragedies will no longer happen.</p>
