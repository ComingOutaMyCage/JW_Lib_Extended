Is Social Media Harming Your Child?—⁠How the Bible Can Help Parents


“The mental health crisis among young people is an emergency—and social media has emerged as an important contributor.”—Dr. Vivek Murthy, U.S. surgeon general, New York Times, June 17, 2024.
How can parents protect their children from the dangers of social media? The Bible offers practical advice.
What parents can do
Consider these Bible principles.
“The shrewd one ponders each step.”—Proverbs 14:15.
In view of the risks involved, do not feel pressured to let your child use social media. Before allowing your child to use social media, make sure that he or she is mature enough to stick to time limits, maintain healthy friendships, and avoid inappropriate content.
             To learn more, read the articles “Should My Child Use Social Media?” and “Teaching Your Teenager Social Media Safety.”


“[Make] the best use of your time.”—Ephesians 5:16.
If you allow your child to use social media, establish rules on its use, and explain how these will help to keep him or her safe. Be alert to any changes in your child’s behavior that could indicate the need to limit his or her access to social media.
              Use the whiteboard animation Be Social-Network Smart to help your child understand why limits are necessary.
