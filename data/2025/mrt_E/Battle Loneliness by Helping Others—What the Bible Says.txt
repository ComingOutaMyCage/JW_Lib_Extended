Battle Loneliness by Helping Others—⁠What the Bible Says


People around the world feel lonely and disconnected from others. Some health experts believe that helping others is a way to combat such feelings.
             “Helping others in need can give meaning to our lives and help combat feelings of isolation or disconnection.”—U.S. National Institutes of Health.


The Bible offers practical advice on what we can do to assist others. Applying what it says can help us to battle feelings of loneliness.
What you can do
Be generous. Look for opportunities to spend time with others, especially in person. Be willing to share what you have. When you do, they are likely to respond with gratitude, which fosters friendship.
             Bible principle: “Practice giving, and people will give to you.”—Luke 6:38.


Invest in others. Look for ways to help people who are going through a hard time. That could include compassionately listening to them or offering to do practical tasks that will lighten their load.
              Bible principle: “A friend is there to help, in any situation.”—Proverbs 17:17, Contemporary English Version.
