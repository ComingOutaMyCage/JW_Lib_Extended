Jesus Will End Crime


Jesus knows what it means to suffer because of crime and injustice. He was falsely accused, unlawfully beaten, unjustly tried, wrongfully convicted, and painfully executed. Though innocent, he willingly and unselfishly sacrificed “his life as a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matthew 20:28; John 15:13) Now, as King of God’s Kingdom, he will soon bring justice throughout the earth, ending crime once and for all.—Isaiah 42:3.
The Bible describes what the world will be like after Jesus takes action:
             “The wicked will be no more; you will look at where they were, and they will not be there. But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—Psalm 37:10, 11.


How can we show appreciation for all that Jesus has done and will yet do for us? One way is to learn more about “the good news of the Kingdom of God,” which was the message that he preached. (Luke 4:43) Read the article “What Is the Kingdom of God?”
