<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Why what you eat matters</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Your health depends, in part, on what you eat. If you maintain food safety and a healthy diet, you can improve your health. In contrast, unsafe food practices and unwholesome food lead to serious health problems, just as poor-quality fuel can lead to car problems. They may not appear immediately, but they <em>will</em> come.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The World Health Organization (WHO) states that “every country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition”—a term that includes not only undernutrition but also conditions such as overweight and obesity. Frequently consuming unwholesome food or drink increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. According to one study, poor nutrition led to at least 11 million deaths in one recent year. WHO estimates that contaminated food kills more than a thousand people every day and leads to health problems for hundreds of millions.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible encourages us to take these issues seriously. It teaches that God is “the source of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) Life is a gift, and we show appreciation for it by caring for our health and that of our families. Consider how you can do that.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Health experts recommend:</strong></p>

</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Use soap and water to wash cutting boards, dishes, and anything else that will touch food. Additionally, avoid using the same board for food that will be cooked and food that will not be cooked.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  Wash all fruits and vegetables, and also disinfect them if you live in an area where crops might have been irrigated using water contaminated with excrement.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  Separate all raw foods—especially meats—from prepared foods when you carry them home from the market and store them.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  After cutting raw meat, thoroughly wash your hands, the knife, and the cutting board before cutting any other food.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Why?</strong> Harmful germs are killed only if the food reaches a high enough temperature.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Health experts recommend:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  Cook food until it is <em>very</em> hot. Food, including the innermost portions of meat, must reach 70 degrees Celsius (160°F) for at least 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>  Bring soups and stews to a boil.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>4. Keep food at safe temperatures.</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Why?</strong> If food is stored at a temperature between 5 and 60 degrees Celsius (40–140°F) for just 20 minutes, the number of bacteria in it can double. Further, if raw meat is not stored at safe temperatures, some bacteria can produce toxins that are not destroyed by cooking.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Health experts recommend:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>  Keep food hot or cold, not lukewarm, to slow or stop germs from multiplying.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>  Never leave food sitting at room temperature for more than two hours, or for more than one hour if the room temperature is over 32 degrees Celsius (90°F).</p>

<h2 id="p34" data-pid="34"><strong>Three keys to healthy eating</strong></h2>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span><strong>1. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables every day.</strong></p>
<div id="f6" class="east_right half">

</div>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>Fruits and vegetables are vital sources of vitamins, minerals, and other essential elements to good health. WHO states that your body needs at least five portions of fruits and vegetables every day. These portions do not include starchy roots, such as potato or cassava.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span><strong>2. Eat only moderate amounts of fats and oils.</strong></p>
<div id="f7" class="east_right half">

</figure>
</div>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span>WHO recommends that you limit your intake of fried foods and processed or commercially baked foods, which often contain unhealthy fats. When possible, cook with unsaturated vegetable oils.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> These oils are better than those that are high in saturated fats.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span><strong>3. Limit your intake of salt and sugar.</strong></p>
<div id="f8" class="east_right half">

</figure>
</div>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>WHO recommends that adults restrict their total daily intake of salt to less than one teaspoonful. WHO also recommends a total intake of less than 60 milliliters (12 level teaspoons) of free sugars daily.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> Sugar is the main ingredient of many processed foods and drinks. For example, an average 355-milliliter (12 fl oz) soft drink contains up to 50 milliliters (10 teaspoons) of sugar. While soft drinks contain many calories, they provide little or no nutritional value.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span>The Bible says: “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>) If you act shrewdly in your eating habits and make any necessary changes, you show appreciation to God for your life and health.</p>

<div class="grpItems borderSolid--bottom"><p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span><strong>Misconception:</strong> Food is safe to eat if it looks, smells, and tastes fine.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> It takes over 10 billion bacteria to make one liter (1 qt) of water look cloudy, but as few as 15 to 20 dangerous bacteria can make you sick. To ensure that your food and drinks are safe, prepare, serve, and store them within the recommended temperatures and time limits.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"></span><strong>Fact:</strong> Flies feed on and breed in filth such as excrement, so they often carry millions of disease-causing germs on their feet. To protect prepared food from contamination by flies, cover it completely.</p>
