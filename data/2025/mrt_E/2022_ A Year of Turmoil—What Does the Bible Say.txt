KEEP ON THE WATCH!
2022: A Year of Turmoil—What Does the Bible Say?


During 2022, war, economic hardship, and environmental disasters have dominated the news. Only the Bible explains the real meaning behind these events.
The real meaning of events in 2022
The events of the last year add to the evidence that we are living in what the Bible calls “the last days.” (2 Timothy 3:1) That time period began in the year 1914. Note how recent events match what the Bible predicted for our time:
“Wars.”—Matthew 24:6.
             “2022 Was [the] Year the Horror of War Returned to Europe.”a



See the article “Russia Invades Ukraine.”

“Food shortages.”—Matthew 24:7.
              “2022: A Year of Unprecedented Hunger.”b



See the article “Ukraine War Fuels Global Food Crisis.”

“Pestilences.”—Luke 21:11.
                 “The reemergence of polio, as monkeypox soared and COVID-19 continues its devastation, has laid bare the magnitude of communicable disease threats and humankind’s vulnerability.”c



See the article “6 Million COVID Deaths.”

“Fearful sights.”—Luke 21:11.
               “Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and floods. Summer 2022 will certainly be remembered for the countless extreme weather events that have brought about destruction, claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, and displaced millions worldwide.”d



See the article “Record-Breaking Temperatures Worldwide.”

“Disturbances [or, “disorders; uprisings,” ftn.].”—Luke 21:9.
               “Rising citizen anger about economic problems, especially surging inflation, drove antigovernment protests to a new high in 2022.”e



See the article “Soaring Worldwide Inflation.”

What will the next year bring?
No one can say for certain what will happen in 2023. What we do know is that soon, God’s Kingdom, or heavenly government, will intervene in earth’s affairs. (Daniel 2:44) That government will eliminate the cause of human suffering and ensure that God’s will is done on the earth.—Matthew 6:9, 10.
We urge you to follow the advice of Jesus Christ and “keep on the watch” to how world events are fulfilling Bible prophecy. (Mark 13:37) Please contact us to learn more about how the Bible can help you now and how it can give you and your family real hope for a better future.
