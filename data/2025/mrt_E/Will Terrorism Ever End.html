<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>In the wake of a terrorist attack, you may naturally ask yourself: ‘Does God care? Why do these things happen? Will terrorism<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> ever end? How can I live with the fear I feel?’ The Bible provides satisfying answers to these questions.</p>
<h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>How does God feel about terrorism?</strong></h2>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>God hates violence and terrorism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:11:5-19:11:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Proverbs 6:16, 17</a>) And Jesus, God’s representative, rebuked his disciples when they resorted to violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:50-40:26:52" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 26:50-52</a>) Although some claim to commit violent attacks in God’s name, he does not authorize their actions. In fact, he does not even listen to their prayers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:15-23:1:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>God cares about all those who suffer, including those affected by terrorist attacks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:31:7-19:31:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 31:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:7</a>) The Bible also indicates that God will act to bring an end to violence.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:18-23:60:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:18</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>The root cause of terrorism</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The Bible reveals the underlying reason for terrorism: “Man has dominated man to his harm.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>) Throughout history, people with power have used terror tactics to oppress others. In response to oppression, others have used terrorism to fight back.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:7-21:7:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>The end of terrorism</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>God promises to eliminate fear and violence and to establish peace on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:18-23:32:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Micah 4:3, 4</a>) He will:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Remove the root cause of terrorism.</strong> God will replace human domination with his <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:502012120/">worldwide government</a>. The Ruler of this government, Jesus Christ, will treat everyone fairly, and he will eliminate oppression and violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:2-19:72:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 72:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:14-19:72:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 14</a>) At that time, no one will resort to terrorism. People “will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Undo all the effects of terrorism.</strong> God will heal people of the effects of terrorism, whether physical harm or emotional trauma. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) He even promises to resurrect the dead, bringing them back to life on a peaceful earth.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The Bible offers us good reasons to believe that <a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:2020087/">God will act soon</a>. However, you may wonder, ‘Why hasn’t God ended terrorism already?’ To find the answer, watch the video <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502018850&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018850&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>Why Does God Allow Suffering?</em></a></p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div id="footnote1" data-fnid="1" class="fn-ref"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> “Terrorism” generally refers to the use or threat of violence—especially against civilians—to instill fear and bring about a political, religious, or social objective. However, people may disagree on whether a particular act should be considered terrorism.</p></div>
