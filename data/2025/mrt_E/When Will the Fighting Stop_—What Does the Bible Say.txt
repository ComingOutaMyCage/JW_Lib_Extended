When Will the Fighting Stop?—⁠What Does the Bible Say?


“Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate. Now is the time for maximum restraint,” said United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres regarding Iran’s direct attack on Israel on Saturday, April 13, 2024.
The fighting in the Middle East is part of a global trend.
“The world is facing the highest number of violent conflicts since the Second World War and 2 billion people—a quarter of humanity—[are] affected.”—United Nations Security Council, January 26, 2023.
Areas that are involved in violent conflicts include Israel, Gaza, Syria, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, Sudan, Ethiopia, Niger, Myanmar, and Haiti.a
When will the fighting stop? Can world leaders bring peace? What does the Bible say?
A world at war
Global conflicts today indicate that an end to all war is soon to come. These wars fulfill Bible prophecy about the time period in which we live. The Bible calls it “the conclusion of the system of things.”—Matthew 24:3.
             “You are going to hear of wars and reports of wars. . . . Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.”—Matthew 24:6, 7.

A war to end all wars
The Bible foretells the end of human conflicts. How will that happen? Not by human efforts, but by means of Armageddon, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (Revelation 16:14, 16) This war will open the way for God to fulfill his promise for mankind to enjoy lasting peace.—Psalm 37:10, 11, 29.
