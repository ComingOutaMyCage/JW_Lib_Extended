UPDATED: April 27, 2023
Terrible gun violence continues to take a tragic toll on many around the world. Consider just a few recent examples.
            “The US is setting a record yearly pace for mass killings, with around one each week.”—April 21, 2023, The Guardian.


            “Ten members of the same family, seven of them female and one a 13-year-old boy, were killed in a mass shooting at a house in South Africa.”—April 21, 2023, AP News.


            “A gunman in Germany shot dead six people before killing himself at a Jehovah’s Witness worship hall in Hamburg.”—March 10, 2023, Reuters.



The Bible offers comfort to those who are suffering as a result of tragic events like these. To see a real-life example, watch the video DeJanerio Brown: Broken but Not Destroyed.
The Bible also helps us to understand why such terrible tragedies happen. To begin exploring this topic, watch the video Why Does God Allow Suffering?



During July 2022, shocking acts of gun violence occurred worldwide:
           “The murder of Japan’s best-known politician [former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe] rattled the country and sent shock waves around the world, particularly given the nation’s low levels of violent crime and strict gun laws.”—July 10, 2022, The Japan Times.


           “Denmark in shock as gunman kills three at Copenhagen shopping mall.”—July 4, 2022, Reuters.


            “South Africa: 15 dead after gunmen open fire at bar in Soweto township.”—July 10, 2022, The Guardian.


            “More than 220 shot and killed in U.S. gun violence over July 4 holiday weekend.”—July 5, 2022, CBS News.



Is there any hope that such violence will end? What does the Bible say?
An End to Violence
The Bible describes our time as “the last days,” a time when people would act in fierce, brutal, and savage ways. (2 Timothy 3:1, 3) Such violent acts cause people to live in fear. (Luke 21:11) However, the Bible promises a time when violence will end and “people will dwell in a peaceful abiding place, in secure dwellings and in tranquil resting-places.” (Isaiah 32:18) How will violence end?
God will remove the wicked and destroy all weapons.
            “As for the wicked, they will be cut off from the earth.”—Proverbs 2:22.

            “[God] is bringing an end to wars throughout the earth. He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the military wagons with fire.”—Psalm 46:9.


God will eliminate the root causes of violent acts by teaching people to live in peace.
            “They will not cause any harm or any ruin in all my holy mountain, because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.”—Isaiah 11:9.

            Even now, God is teaching people worldwide to shun violence and the use of weapons, to “beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.”—Micah 4:3.
