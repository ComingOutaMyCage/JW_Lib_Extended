This prayer is found in what is commonly called the New Testament. The prayer begins: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified</em> [<em>or hallowed</em>].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 6:9</em></a>) <em>Yet, God’s name, rendered in English as “Jehovah” or sometimes “Yahweh,” is rarely found in English translations of the New Testament.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The English Bible translators Lancelot Shadwell and Frederick Parker believed that God’s name should be restored to the New Testament. Why use the word “restored”? Because they concluded that God’s name was there originally but was later taken out. Why did they draw that conclusion?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Shadwell and Parker knew that existing manuscripts of what is often called the <strong>Old</strong> Testament, originally written mainly in Hebrew, include God’s personal name thousands of times.

<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Even before Shadwell and Parker published their English translations, other translators had restored God’s name to their English translations of the New Testament, but only in relatively few places.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Prior to 1863, when Parker published <em>A Literal Translation of the New Testament,</em> no English translator is known to have restored God’s name <strong>extensively</strong> in a published New Testament. Who were Lancelot Shadwell and Frederick Parker?</p>
<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Lancelot Shadwell</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Lancelot Shadwell (1808-1861) was a barrister and the son of Sir Lancelot Shadwell, the vice-chancellor of England. The son belonged to the Church of England. Although he believed in the Trinity, he showed respect for God’s name, describing it as “the glorious name of JEHOVAH.” In his translation, <em>The Gospels of Matthew, and of Mark,</em> he used “Jehovah” 28 times in the main text and 465 times in the accompanying notes.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Shadwell may have learned about God’s name by seeing it in the Old Testament in the original Hebrew. He stated that those who had replaced God’s name with the term <em>Kyʹri·os</em> in the Greek translation of the Old Testament “were not honest translators.”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>In his translation, Shadwell first used “Jehovah” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:20-40:1:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 1:20</a>. His note for that verse says: “The word [<em>Kyʹri·os</em>] in this, and in many other passages in [the] N.T. means JEHOVAH, the proper name of God: and it is most important to restore this word to the English translation.” He also stated: “The honour of God requires it. He has declared himself by the name of JEHOVAH: and we cannot do better than use that name when we speak of him.” He then said: “In our E.V. [Established, Authorized, or King James Version] of the Bible, the name of JEHOVAH rarely occurs . . . Instead of the proper name of God, we read, <em>The Lord.”</em> Shadwell claimed: “<em>The Lord</em> . . . is a most unworthy title” to use as a substitute for God’s name, adding that even he is called “<em>The Lord”</em> at his manor, or country home.</p>

</div>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Shadwell published his translation of Matthew in 1859 and his combined version of Matthew and Mark in 1861. But then his work came to an end. He died on January 11, 1861, at the age of 52. Nevertheless, his efforts were not in vain.</p>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Frederick Parker</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Shadwell’s translation of Matthew came to the attention of a wealthy London businessman named Frederick Parker (1804-1888), who set out to translate the New Testament when he was about 20 years of age. Unlike Shadwell, Parker rejected the teaching of the Trinity. He wrote: “[May] the whole Church of [God’s] dear Son . . . heartily embrace the truth . . . and worship the one Almighty Jehovah.” Parker also felt that New Testament manuscripts that use <em>Kyʹri·os</em> for both the Lord God and the Lord Jesus obscured the distinction between the two. So he was intrigued to see that in certain contexts Shadwell rendered <em>Kyʹri·os</em> as “Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>How did Parker understand such matters? He studied Greek and wrote several books and tracts on Greek grammar. He also became a member of the Anglo-Biblical Institute, which promoted research into Bible manuscripts with a view to producing better English Bibles. In 1842, Parker began publishing his first translation of the New Testament in several parts and editions.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>

<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Parker’s Efforts to Restore God’s Name</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>For some years Parker had written regarding such questions as: “When does <em>Kyʹri·os</em> refer to the Lord Jesus, and when does it refer to the Lord God?” “Why is <em>Kyʹri·os</em> often used grammatically as a name and not as a title?”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>When Parker saw Shadwell’s 1859 translation of Matthew with its comments on <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> he became convinced that in certain contexts, <em>Kyʹri·os</em> “should be translated <em>Jehovah.”</em> So he revised his entire translation of the New Testament to include “Jehovah” wherever he believed that the context or grammar of the Greek text indicated it. Thus, Parker’s one-volume 1863 edition of <em>A Literal Translation of the New Testament</em> contains God’s name 187 times in the main text. As far as is known, this is the first published English version to use the divine name <strong><em>throughout</em></strong> the Christian Greek Scriptures.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span id="footnotesource4" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>In 1864, Parker also released <em>A Collation of an English Version of the New Testament . . . With the Authorized English Version.</em> His reason for combining the two New Testaments into one volume was to show where and how his version differed from the other.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span id="footnotesource5" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>To illustrate the value of restoring God’s name, Parker pointed to a number of verses in the <em>Authorized Version,</em> including <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 10:13</a>, which reads: “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Parker asked: “[Who] ever gathered from the Authorized English Version of these Verses, that it was <em>Jehovah,</em> and not <em>The Son</em> Jesus Christ our Lord, . . . referred to in them”?</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Parker spent thousands of pounds—a fortune back then—on publishing and advertising his tracts, papers, and other writings. In fact, in just one year, he spent 800 pounds, which is equivalent to over 100,000 British pounds ($132,000 U.S.) today. He also sent complimentary copies of many of his publications to acquaintances and high-ranking clergy for their review.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>Parker’s writings and his translations of the New Testament, which had a very limited printing, were ridiculed by some scholars. In doing so, however, they drew attention away from the sincere effort that he, as well as Shadwell and others, had made to restore God’s personal name to the English New Testament.</p>
