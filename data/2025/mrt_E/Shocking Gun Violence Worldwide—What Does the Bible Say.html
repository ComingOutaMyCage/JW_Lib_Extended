<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Is there any hope that such violence will end? What does the Bible say?</p>
<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>An End to Violence</strong></h2>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>The Bible describes our time as “<a class="xt" data-xtid="76" href="jwpub://p/E:502016185/">the last days</a>,” a time when people would act in fierce, brutal, and savage ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:3-55:3:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Such violent acts cause people to live in fear. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) However, the Bible promises a time when violence will end and “people will dwell in a peaceful abiding place, in secure dwellings and in tranquil resting-places.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:18-23:32:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:18</a>) How will violence end?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>God will remove the wicked and destroy all weapons.</strong></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>God will eliminate the root causes of violent acts by teaching people to live in peace.</strong></p>

<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>            Even now, God is teaching people worldwide to shun violence and the use of weapons, to “beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Micah 4:3</a>.</p>
