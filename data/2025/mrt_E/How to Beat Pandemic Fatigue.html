<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Has living under the threat of COVID-19 begun to wear you down? If so, you are not alone. For months, people around the globe have had to adapt to living under the threat of this pandemic. Many “have made huge sacrifices to contain COVID-19,” says Dr. Hans Kluge, World Health Organization Regional Director for Europe. “In such circumstances it is easy and natural to feel apathetic and demotivated, to experience fatigue.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>If you are experiencing what is being called pandemic fatigue, take courage. The Bible is helping many to cope with life during this stressful time. It can help you too.</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>What is pandemic fatigue?</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Pandemic fatigue is not a medical condition but is a term used to describe the natural response people feel to the prolonged uncertainty and disruption caused by a pandemic. While each person reacts differently, some common signs of pandemic fatigue include:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Lack of motivation</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Changes in eating or sleeping habits</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Irritability</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Stress over tasks that would normally be handled well</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Difficulty concentrating</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  Feelings of hopelessness</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Why is pandemic fatigue serious?</strong></h2>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Pandemic fatigue poses a serious threat to our safety and that of others. If we do not battle it, we may gradually begin to lose our motivation to follow COVID-safe practices. Over time, we may become complacent about the virus, even while it continues to spread and kill. Tired of living under restrictions, we may seek greater freedom, which could put us and others at risk.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>During these stressful times, many are experiencing the truth of what the Bible says: “If you become discouraged in the day of distress, your strength will be meager.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>) The Bible offers principles that can help us cope with discouraging situations, including this pandemic.</p>
<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>What Bible principles can help you to beat pandemic fatigue?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  <strong>Stay at a distance physically—but not socially</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>What the Bible says:</strong> “A true friend . . . is born for times of distress.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Why it matters:</strong> True friends build us up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>) In contrast, prolonged isolation puts our health at risk.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:1-20:18:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Try this:</strong> Stay connected with your friends through video chats, phone calls, or e-mail and text messages. Reach out to friends when you are having a bad day, and regularly check in to see how they are doing. Exchange tips on what is helping you to cope during the pandemic. Find ways to do something kind for a friend, and you will make a bad day feel better.</p>

<p id="p57" data-pid="57">“I try to make plans to have a videoconference with friends. Sometimes we get together one-on-one. At other times, it’s fun to get a group together to play a game or just to catch up. Even though it’s not quite the same as meeting in person, it really helps. The pandemic has made life hard, so it’s important to reach out to our friends and be honest about how we feel. It can be difficult to do, but we all need help.”—Megan, Canada.</p>
