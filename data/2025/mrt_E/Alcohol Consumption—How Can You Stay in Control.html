<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What is moderate alcohol consumption?</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>What the Bible says:</strong> “Do not be among those who drink too much wine.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:20-20:23:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Consider:</strong> The Bible does not condemn drinking alcohol in moderation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:7-21:9:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>) However, it does distinguish between moderate drinking, heavy drinking, and drunkenness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 21:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:18-49:5:18" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:3-56:2:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Titus 2:3</a>) Even when it does not lead to drunkenness, drinking too much alcohol can harm your decision-making ability, your health, or your relationships with others.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:29-20:23:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:29, 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Many authorities recognize the difference between lower-risk and higher-risk drinking, and they often express it in terms of the number of standard drinks a person consumes per day and the number of days per week a person drinks.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> However, people all react differently to alcohol, and there are times when the best choice is not to drink at all. According to the World Health Organization:</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="indent"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>“Even one or two drinks can be too much</strong>—for example:</p>
<ul class="indent"><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  When driving or operating machinery.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  When pregnant or breast feeding.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  When taking certain medications.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  If you have certain medical conditions.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  If you cannot control your drinking.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Consider:</strong> You can protect yourself from the harmful effects of alcohol if you regularly examine your drinking habits and change them if needed. Look for the following signs that may indicate that you are losing control.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  <strong>You rely on alcohol to be happy.</strong> You feel that you need to drink to relax, socialize, or have fun. You drink to cope with your problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  <strong>You drink more than you used to.</strong> You drink more frequently. Your drinks are stronger, and it takes more of them for you to feel the same effect that you used to.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  <strong>Your drinking has caused you problems</strong> at home or at work. For example, you spend more money on alcohol than you can afford.</p>

</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Others express concern about your drinking.</strong> When they do, you get defensive. You try to conceal your drinking from others, or you lie about how much you are drinking.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  <strong>You have trouble stopping.</strong> You have tried to cut back or stop drinking, but you cannot.</p>
