KEEP ON THE WATCH!
People Losing Trust In Politicians—⁠What Does the Bible Say?


The year 2024 will see a record number of elections taking place around the world. However, many people are losing trust in politicians.
             A majority of Americans surveyed say that “most politicians are motivated by selfish reasons” rather than a desire to serve the public.a—Pew Research Center, September 19, 2023.


Many young people likewise lack trust in politicians.
             “Teenagers tend to be issue oriented, but say in surveys that politicians do not represent their needs.”—The New York Times, January 29, 2024.

              “Young people trust YouTubers more than politicians, poll suggests.”—The Korea Times, January 22, 2024.


Can we trust politicians for a better future? Who can be trusted?
Careful whom you trust
People are right to be cautious about whom they trust. The Bible says that “the naive person believes every word, but the shrewd one ponders each step.”—Proverbs 14:15.
              For helpful tips on how to evaluate the information you receive, read the article “Protect Yourself From Misinformation.”


Furthermore, even the most honest and well-intentioned politicians are limited in what they can do. That is why the Bible warns:
               “Don’t put your trust in human leaders; no human being can save you.”—Psalm 146:3, Good News Translation.


A leader you can trust
The Bible explains that God has appointed a most capable and trustworthy leader: Jesus Christ. (Luke 1:32, 33) Jesus is the King of God’s Kingdom, a government that rules from heaven.—Matthew 6:10.
               Learn why you can trust Jesus and what he will do to solve the problems we face. Read the articles “Who Is the King of God’s Kingdom?” and “What Will God’s Kingdom Accomplish?”
