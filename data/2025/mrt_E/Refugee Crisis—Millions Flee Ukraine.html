<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>What are the real causes of this refugee crisis?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The refugee crisis in Ukraine began because of a military invasion by Russia. However, the Bible reveals deeper, underlying causes for all such refugee crises:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Human governments</strong> worldwide have failed the human family. Those in power often use governmental authority as a means of oppression.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:1-21:4:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8:9</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Satan the Devil,</strong> “the ruler of the world,” exerts such an <a class="xt" data-xtid="135" href="jwpub://p/E:502013281/">evil influence</a> on mankind that the Bible says: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Besides the problems that have plagued mankind for centuries, we now live in a period of time foretold by the Bible: “In <strong>the last days</strong> critical times hard to deal with will be here.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) What is more, these days would be marked by wars, natural disasters, food shortages, and pestilences—events that cause people to flee.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:10, 11</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>Where can refugees turn for hope?</strong></h2>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>The Bible reveals that our Creator, Jehovah,<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> is a God who has love and compassion for refugees and people displaced from their homes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:18-5:10:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>) He promises to solve the problems of refugees by means of his heavenly government, called God’s Kingdom, which will replace human governments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:10</a>) Jehovah will use his Kingdom to remove Satan the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a>) That Kingdom will be a global government, eliminating the divisions caused by national borders. All mankind will form a united worldwide family. No one will ever again need to flee his home, for the Bible promises: “They will sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the mouth of Jehovah of armies has spoken.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:4-33:4:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Micah 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Only God’s Kingdom can provide a lasting solution to the refugee crises we experience today. Jehovah will use his Kingdom to remove the problems that force people to become refugees. Consider some examples:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  <strong>War.</strong> “[Jehovah] is bringing an end to wars.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:46:9-19:46:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 46:9</a>) To find out how God will end conflict, read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="136" href="jwpub://p/E:502012123/">Peace on Earth—How Will It Come?</a>”</p>

<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  <strong>Oppression and violence.</strong> “From oppression and from violence [Jehovah] will rescue them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:14-19:72:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 72:14</a>) To understand how people can change ingrained attitudes, read the series of articles entitled “<a class="xt" data-xtid="137" href="jwpub://p/E:2022002/">Breaking the Cycle of Hatred</a>.”</p>

<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  <strong>Poverty.</strong> “[Jehovah] will rescue the poor who cry for help.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 72:12</a>) To see how God will address the root causes of poverty, read the article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:501100030/">Is a Fair Economic System Possible?</a>”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>  <strong>Food shortages.</strong> “There will be an abundance of grain on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a>) To find out how God will ensure that no one goes hungry, read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="138" href="jwpub://p/E:102005843/">A World Without Hunger?</a>”</p>
