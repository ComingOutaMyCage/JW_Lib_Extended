Finding Hope in 2024​—⁠What Does the Bible Say?


Many see no way out of the problems facing the world in 2024. Yet, we can find hope for the future. Where?
The Bible gives hope
The Bible promises that God will solve the problems that make our life today seem hopeless. Soon, God “will wipe out every tear from [our] eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”​—Revelation 21:4.

How the Bible can help you now
The Bible provides a hope for the future that can help you to fight negative feelings and to have a more positive outlook. (Romans 15:13) The Bible’s practical advice can also help you to deal with problems you may now face, such as poverty, injustice, and illness.
