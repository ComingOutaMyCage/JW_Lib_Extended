Jesus Will End War


While on earth, Jesus showed great love for people, even to the point of sacrificing his life for them. (Matthew 20:28; John 15:13) Soon, he will again prove his love for people by using his authority as King of God’s Kingdom to bring “an end to wars throughout the earth.”—Psalm 46:9.
Notice how the Bible describes what Jesus will do:
             “He will rescue the poor who cry for help, also the lowly one and whoever has no helper. He will have pity on the lowly and the poor, and the lives of the poor he will save. From oppression and from violence he will rescue them.”—Psalm 72:12-14.


How can we show appreciation for all that Jesus has done and will yet do for us? One way is to learn more about “the good news of the Kingdom of God,” which was the message that he preached. (Luke 4:43) Read the article “What is the Kingdom of God?”
