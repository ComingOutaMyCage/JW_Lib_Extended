<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Our world continues to face the threat of nuclear war as world powers maintain and expand their nuclear arsenals. People are naturally concerned that the greater the number of nuclear weapons that exist, the greater the danger that a nuclear war will start. There is even the fear that the use of just one small-scale nuclear weapon will ignite a full-scale nuclear war that will devastate our world. We are living with, as the <em>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</em> observes, “the ever-present danger of nuclear war.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Could nuclear war possibly occur? If so, will our planet survive? And how can we cope with our anxiety about a potential nuclear war? What does the Bible say?</p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Does the Bible predict nuclear war?</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible does not specifically mention nuclear war. However, the threat of nuclear war is a result of attitudes and events that the Bible foretold.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Consider the following Bible verses in the context of current world events:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Bible verses:</strong> Jesus’ disciples asked: <em>“What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?”</em> Jesus replied: <em>“Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.”—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 24:3,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> <em>7</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>World events:</strong> Countries, including those with nuclear capabilities, increasingly resort to armed conflict.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>“The world is getting far more violent in recent years: conflict event rates have increased.”—The Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Bible verse:</strong> <em>“In the time of the end the king of the south will engage with</em> [<em>the king of the north</em>] <em>in a pushing.”—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:40-27:11:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Daniel 11:40</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>World events:</strong> Rival nations and their allies are pushing, or competing, for supremacy, as the Bible predicted. Today’s biggest nuclear powers might avoid direct confrontation, but they are expanding the capabilities of their nuclear weapons.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>“We have witnessed an emerging trend of increased conflict between states in the last decade, including cases where major powers support opposite sides.”—The Uppsala Conflict Data Program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Bible verses:</strong> <em>“In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be . . . <strong>not open to any agreement</strong>, slanderers, without self-control, <strong>fierce</strong>.<strong>”</strong>—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>2 Timothy 3:1-3</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>World events:</strong> Like many people today, world leaders are prone to disagree. And rather than use peaceful means to settle their differences, they may try to resolve their conflicts by using threats or force. Such actions stoke the threat of nuclear war.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>“Without a practical approach to strengthening cooperation, conflicts will grow deadlier.”—S. Saran and J. Harman, <em>World Economic Forum.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="p24" data-pid="24"><strong>Would God permit nuclear war?</strong></h2>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>The Bible does not say. It does say that “fearful sights,” or terrifying events, would occur in our day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) An example of such events includes atomic bombs being dropped during the Second World War. The Bible explains why God has permitted wars.

<h2 id="p26" data-pid="26"><strong>Will planet Earth survive?</strong></h2>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Yes. Even if man were to use nuclear weapons again, God would not allow the situation to escalate to the point of global annihilation. The Bible says that our planet will not only survive threats to its existence but will also host human life forever.</p>

<h2 id="p33" data-pid="33"><strong>How can you cope with “nuclear anxiety”?</strong></h2>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span>Some may suffer from “nuclear anxiety,” which has been defined as “fear of a nuclear war and its consequences.” The Bible’s promises and advice can help those affected to cope and to lessen their fears. How?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>The Bible describes a bright future for the earth and for those living on it. Learning about this hope can act as “an anchor for our lives,” reducing anxiety. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:19</a>, footnote) We can also minimize anxiety by taking one day at a time, not being consumed by thoughts of what might happen in the future. As Jesus said, “each day has enough of its own troubles.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 6:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>In fact, we all do well to take care of our mental and emotional health. We can do that by avoiding unnecessary exposure to information that generates anxiety, such as discussions, predictions, and opinions about the latest nuclear developments. This does not mean that we choose to live in denial. Rather, we are taking steps to free our mind from dwelling on events over which we have no control and which may never happen.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span>The Bible, however, uses the word “Armageddon” to refer to a war between “the kings of the entire inhabited earth,” or human governments, and God.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Armageddon will not involve random destruction, leaving behind the devastation of a man-made nuclear holocaust.
