KEEP ON THE WATCH!
Devastating Floods—What Does the Bible Say?


Worldwide, many people are coping with devastating floods. Note these reports:
             “China’s capital has recorded its heaviest rainfall in at least 140 years over the past few days after being deluged with . . . 744.8 millimeters (29.3 inches) of rain between Saturday and Wednesday.”—AP News, August 2, 2023.

             “Typhoon Khanun brought heavy rains and powerful winds to southern Japan for a second day Thursday, killing at least two people. . . . The storm is expected to bring total rainfall of up to 0.6 meters (2 feet) in mountainous central Taiwan.”—Deutsche Welle, August 3, 2023.

              “The weekend flooding [in Nova Scotia] was caused by the heaviest torrential rains to hit the Atlantic Canada region in 50 years.”—BBC News, July 24, 2023.


What does the Bible say about such events?
A sign of “the last days”
The Bible reveals that we are living in a period of time called “the last days.” (2 Timothy 3:1) Jesus prophesied that during our time, we would see “fearful sights,” or terrifying events. (Luke 21:11) Climate change has contributed to terrifying weather events that are more unpredictable, more frequent, and more intense.
A reason for hope
The Bible tells us that the many terrifying things taking place on earth today actually provide a reason for hope. Why? Jesus said: “When you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.”—Luke 21:31; Matthew 24:3.
The events we see happening indicate that God’s Kingdom will soon bring earth’s natural elements, including the water cycle, completely under control.—Job 36:27, 28; Psalm 107:29.
