KEEP ON THE WATCH!
Who Will Save the Civilians? —What Does the Bible Say?


As reported by the United Nations:
                 From October 7 to October 23, 2023, the Gaza-Israel conflict has resulted in more than 6,400 killed and 15,200 injured, most of whom were civilians. In addition, hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

               As of September 24, 2023, the war between Russia and Ukraine resulted in 9,701 civilians killed and 17,748 injured in Ukraine.


What hope does the Bible offer for those who suffer from war?
A reason for hope
The Bible foretells that God will bring “an end to wars throughout the earth.” (Psalm 46:9) He will use a heavenly government, or kingdom, to replace all human governments. (Daniel 2:44) God’s Kingdom will bring relief to mankind.
Note what Jesus Christ, the King of God’s Kingdom, will do:
              “He will rescue the poor who cry for help, also the lowly one and whoever has no helper. He will have pity on the lowly and the poor, and the lives of the poor he will save. From oppression and from violence he will rescue them.”—Psalm 72:12-14.


By means of his Kingdom, God will completely undo the misery and suffering caused by warfare and violence.
              “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”—Revelation 21:4.


Soon God’s Kingdom will intervene in earth’s affairs. The Bible foretold the “wars and reports of wars” that we see happening today. (Matthew 24:6) These and other events indicate that we are living in “the last days” of human rulership.—2 Timothy 3:1.
