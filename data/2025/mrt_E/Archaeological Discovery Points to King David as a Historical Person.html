<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>According to the Bible, King David of Israel lived in the 11th century B.C.E. and his descendants ruled for hundreds of years. But some critics have argued that David is a myth, a tribal legend created much later. Was King David a real person?</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>In 1993, archaeologist Avraham Biran and his team discovered a stone fragment at Tel Dan, northern Israel, bearing an inscription that refers to the “House of David.” The inscription, in an ancient <a class="xt" data-xtid="68" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077383/">Semitic</a> script, dates to the ninth century B.C.E. It was evidently part of a monument erected by the <a class="xt" data-xtid="69" href="jwpub://p/E:1001077021/">Aramaeans</a>, boasting of victories over the Israelites.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>An article in <em>Bible History Daily</em> states: “The ‘House of David’ inscription had its skeptics . . . However, most Biblical scholars and archaeologists readily accepted that the Tel Dan stela had supplied the first concrete proof of a historical King David from the Bible, making it one of the top Biblical archaeology discoveries reported in BAR [<em>Biblical Archaeology Review</em>].”</p>
