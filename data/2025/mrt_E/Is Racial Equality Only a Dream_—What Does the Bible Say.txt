Is Racial Equality Only a Dream?—What Does the Bible Say?


For many people, racial equality remains an unfulfilled dream.
               “Racism continues to poison institutions, social structures, and everyday life in every society. It continues to be a driver of persistent inequality.”—António Guterres, UN Secretary-General.


Will racial equality ever be realized? What does the Bible say?
God’s view of racial equality
The Bible teaches us how God views people of different races.
              “[God] made out of one man every nation of men to dwell on the entire surface of the earth.”—Acts 17:26.

              “God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.”—Acts 10:34, 35.


The Bible reveals that all humans are related and that God accepts people of every race.
How racial equality will be realized
Equality will be realized by God’s Kingdom, a heavenly government. That government will teach people how to treat others in the right way. People will learn how to overcome any feelings of racism they may have.
              “The inhabitants of the land [will] learn about righteousness.”—Isaiah 26:9.

               “The result of true righteousness will be peace, and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquility and security.”—Isaiah 32:17.


Today, millions of people are learning from the Bible how to treat others with respect and dignity.
