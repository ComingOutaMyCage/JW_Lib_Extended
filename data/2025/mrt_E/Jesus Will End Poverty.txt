Jesus Will End Poverty


While on earth, Jesus showed great love for people, especially those who were poor and in distress. (Matthew 9:36) He even sacrificed his life for the benefit of others. (Matthew 20:28; John 15:13) Soon, he will again prove his love for people by using his authority and power as King of God’s Kingdom to bring an end to poverty throughout the earth.
In poetic words, the Bible describes what Jesus will do:
             “Let him defend the lowly among the people, let him save the sons of the poor.”—Psalm 72:4.


How can we show appreciation for all that Jesus has done and will yet do for us? One way is to learn about “the good news of the Kingdom of God,” which was the message that he preached. (Luke 4:43) Read the article “What Is the Kingdom of God?”
