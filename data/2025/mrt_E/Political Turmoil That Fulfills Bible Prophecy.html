</header>
<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>People today are deeply divided over politics. They disagree over the laws that touch their everyday lives, and they aggressively express their differing political opinions. In government, lawmakers and other officials often hold opposing positions and are unwilling to yield. Such differences lead to political turmoil that can cripple a government’s ability to work.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Especially significant, though, is the political turmoil in the United States and Britain (as the United Kingdom is often informally known). Why? Because the Bible foretold that this turmoil would exist within these two nations—at the very time when a heavenly government set up by God would intervene in man’s affairs.</p>
<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>Political turmoil in “the final part of the days”</strong></h2>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible contains an astonishing prophecy, recorded in the book of Daniel. In that prophecy, God revealed “what is to happen in the final part of the days,” which at the time was referring to a future, decisive point in human history.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:28-27:2:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 2:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>This Bible prophecy was presented in a dream that God gave to the king of Babylon. In that dream, <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&amp;lank=pub-dlf_1_VIDEO&amp;ts=00:40:15-00:42:35">the king saw an enormous image</a> forged out of different metals. Later, the prophet Daniel explained that from the head down to the feet, the image represented world powers that would rise and fall throughout history.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Eventually, the image would be completely destroyed after being hit by a rock that represented a Kingdom, or a government, set up by God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:36-27:2:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 2:36-45</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>According to the prophecy, God’s Kingdom would replace all human governments. This Kingdom is the same one that Jesus taught his followers to pray for when he said: “Let your Kingdom come.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>But where in the prophecy does the Bible predict political turmoil? Note that the feet of the image were made “partly of iron and partly of clay.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:33-27:2:33" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 2:33</a>) That mixture was different from the solid metals that made up the rest of the image, indicating that there would be one world power that would be different from the others. How? Daniel’s prophecy explains:</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>“And just as you saw the feet and the toes to be partly of clay of a potter and partly of iron, <strong>the kingdom will be divided,</strong> but some of the hardness of iron will be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with soft clay. And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, so <strong>the kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.</strong> Just as you saw iron mixed with soft clay, <strong>they will be mixed with the people; but they will not stick together,</strong> one to the other, just as iron does not mix with clay.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:41-27:2:43" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 2:41-43</a>.</p>
</div>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>According to the prophecy, the world power represented by the feet of the image would experience political turmoil. Its strength would be compromised, that is, weakened from within, by its own people.</p>
<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Daniel’s prophecy fulfilled today</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The feet of the image represent the dominant world power today, the alliance between the United States and Britain. How do modern developments point to that conclusion?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The feet of the image are made “partly of iron and partly of clay,” a combination that is inherently weak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:42-27:2:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 2:42</a>) Today, the power of both the United States and Britain is weakened by elements within their own societies. For example, both countries experience internal conflicts among their own citizens. People violently protest for their rights. Their elected representatives often fail to reach a majority agreement. Because their people are so divided, both governments are at times unable to implement their policies effectively.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> Although they contend with internal political divisions, the United States and Britain maintain powerful military forces. Because of that, they can act with authority, with a strength like iron.</p>
