Reasons for Hope in 2023—What Does the Bible Say?


As the year 2023 begins, we all hope for the best for ourselves and our families. Why can we be hopeful?
The Bible gives hope
The Bible shares the good news that the problems we now face are temporary and will soon be resolved. In fact, the Bible was “written for our instruction, so that through. . . the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.”—Romans 15:4.
             To learn more about what the Bible promises, read the article “A Real Hope for a Better Tomorrow.”


A hope that can help you now
The Bible’s hope can be like “an anchor for our lives.” (Hebrews 6:19, footnote) That hope can stabilize us. It can help us to cope with our present problems, to have a positive attitude, and to find lasting happiness. For example:
                Find out how the Bible’s hope helped a man who struggled with addiction. Watch the video I Got Fed Up With My Lifestyle.

                See how the Bible’s hope can help us when we lose a loved one in death. Watch the video Comfort for Those Who Mourn.


Strengthen your hope
Many people hope for good things to happen, but they cannot be sure that their hopes will ever be fulfilled. What the Bible promises is different. Why? Because the Bible’s promises are from Jehovah Goda himself, “who cannot lie.” (Titus 1:2) Only Jehovah has the power to fulfill all his promises; he can do “everything he pleases to do.”—Psalm 135:5, 6.
We warmly invite you to benefit from the Bible’s reliable hope. You can build up your trust in it by “carefully examining the Scriptures.” (Acts 17:11) Find out for yourself by trying our free guided Bible study course. Start 2023 with a hopeful outlook!

a Jehovah is the personal name of God.—Psalm 83:18.
