<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The year 2024 will see a record number of elections taking place around the world. However, many people are losing trust in politicians.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>       A majority of Americans surveyed say that “most politicians are motivated by selfish reasons” rather than a desire to serve the public.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>—Pew Research Center, September 19, 2023.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Many young people likewise lack trust in politicians.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>       “Teenagers tend to be issue oriented, but say in surveys that politicians do not represent their needs.”—<em>The New York Times,</em> January 29, 2024.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>       “Young people trust YouTubers more than politicians, poll suggests.”—<em>The Korea Times,</em> January 22, 2024.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Can we trust politicians for a better future? Who can be trusted?</p>
<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Careful whom you trust</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>People are right to be cautious about whom they trust. The Bible says that “the naive person believes every word, but the shrewd one ponders each step.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Furthermore, even the most honest and well-intentioned politicians are limited in what they can do. That is why the Bible warns:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>        “Don’t put your trust in human leaders; no human being can save you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>A leader you can trust</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>The Bible explains that God has appointed a most capable and trustworthy leader: Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>) Jesus is the King of God’s Kingdom, a government that rules from heaven.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>        Learn why you can trust Jesus and what he will do to solve the problems we face.
