<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>All of us need clean water for life. But “with global demand for water continuing to increase,” warned UN Secretary-General António Guterres, “we face a grave water crisis.” Billions of people around the world already lack ready access to potable water.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Will we ever have enough water for all? Or will we always have to deal with water crises? What does the Bible say?</p>
<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>What the Bible promises about the water supply</strong></h2>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible states that water shortages will one day be eliminated. In fact, there will be an abundance of clean, fresh water.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>“Waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert plain. The heat-parched ground will become a reedy pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:6-23:35:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:6, 7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Why can we believe that Bible promise? Consider what the Bible says about one aspect of the way our planet was designed.</p>
<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>What the Bible says about the earth and its water cycle</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>“[God] did not create [the earth] simply for nothing, but formed it to be inhabited.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="tt7" class="borderSolid--bottom">
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Because God made the earth to support life, he put in place natural systems to produce an abundance of fresh water.</p>
</div>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>“[God] draws up the drops of water; they condense into rain from his mist; then the clouds pour it down; they shower down upon mankind.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:27-18:36:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 36:27, 28</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="tt9" class="borderSolid--bottom">
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>In simple terms, this passage describes God’s design for a natural and reliable water recycling and supply system. Water evaporates from land and sea, condenses, and falls as rain, providing a constant supply of clean, fresh water for humans and animals.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:7-21:1:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:8-30:5:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Amos 5:8</a>.</p>
</div>
<blockquote><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>“I will give you showers of rain at their proper time, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will give their fruit.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:4-3:26:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus 26:4</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>God promised to bless the ancient Israelites, an agricultural people, with a fruitful harvest by giving them a regular supply of water. He knows that successful food production relies on predictable rains.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>What God did in ancient Israel he will soon do for the entire earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:23-23:30:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:23</a>) In the meantime, in many parts of the world, water crises are increasing, and a lack of rain is only part of the problem. What else does the Bible say about the solution to today’s water problems?</p>
<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>How the water crisis will end</strong></h2>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>The Bible reveals that God, by means of his Kingdom, will solve the problems afflicting our planet, including today’s water crisis. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government that will rule over the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:15</a>) Moreover, God’s Kingdom will do what human governments are incapable of doing—it will eliminate the causes of our water problems.</p>

</div>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Problem:</strong> Climate change is contributing to a serious imbalance in the water cycle. The consequences include severe droughts as well as major flooding, whether from torrential rains or rising sea levels.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Solution:</strong> God’s Kingdom will restore the natural balance of the environment so that our planet can recover. God has promised: “Look! I am making all things new.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>) Parched lands will enjoy abundant fresh water, making life blossom even in places that are now uninhabitable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:17-23:41:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:17-20</a>) God’s Kingdom, in the hands of Jesus Christ, will also control earth’s natural forces.</p>
<div id="tt12" class="borderSolid--bottom">
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>When Jesus was on earth, he calmed a frightening storm and in this way gave a glimpse of the power God had given him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:39-41:4:39" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 4:39,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:41-41:4:41" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 41</a>) Under Christ’s rule as King of God’s Kingdom, natural disasters will cease. People will enjoy true peace and security, not fearing disasters of any kind.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Problem:</strong> Shortsighted humans and greedy corporations pollute rivers, lakes, and underground reservoirs, thus adding to the shortage of clean water.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Solution:</strong> God will cleanse the earth and restore the health of its rivers, lakes, seas, and soil. The earth will become a paradise. In poetic terms, the Bible states: “The wilderness and the parched land will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Problem:</strong> Water resources are being mismanaged, with supplies being depleted faster than they can be replenished.</p>
