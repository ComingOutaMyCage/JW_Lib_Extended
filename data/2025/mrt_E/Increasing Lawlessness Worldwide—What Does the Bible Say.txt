KEEP ON THE WATCH!
Increasing Lawlessness Worldwide—⁠What Does the Bible Say?


Gang violence overwhelms Haiti. Violent crime plagues South Africa and Mexico as well as other Latin American countries. Even where violence has decreased, reports of property crimes cause feelings of insecurity and anxiety.
What does the Bible say about the lawlessness occurring worldwide?
What the Bible foretold about lawlessness
The Bible foretold that lawlessness would be a part of the sign of “the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matthew 24:3) When describing the events that make up that sign, Jesus Christ said:
             “Because of the increasing of lawlessness, the love of the greater number will grow cold.”—Matthew 24:12.


The Bible also foretold that “in the last days” people would be “without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5) Such selfish traits contribute to the lawless behavior we see today.
But there is reason for hope. The Bible promises that soon lawlessness will be done away with.
              “Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; you will look at where they were, and they will not be there. But the meek will possess the earth, and they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—Psalm 37:10, 11.
