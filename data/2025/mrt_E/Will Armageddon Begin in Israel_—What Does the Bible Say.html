<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Bible describes Armageddon, not as a regional conflict, but as a global war fought between all human governments and God.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">        <span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>       “Expressions inspired by demons . . . go out to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. . . . They gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The word “Armageddon” comes from the Hebrew word <em>Har Meghid·dohnʹ,</em> meaning “Mountain of Megiddo.” Megiddo was a city in the territory of ancient Israel. For that reason, some people believe that Armageddon will be fought in Israel. However, neither the region of Megiddo nor any other area in the Middle East is big enough to hold “the kings of the <em>entire</em> inhabited earth” and their armies.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The book of Revelation was written “in signs,” or in symbolic language. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 1:1</a>) Armageddon refers, not to a literal location, but to the <em>worldwide</em> situation in which the nations assemble in their last stand against rule by God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:19-66:19:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19-21</a>.</p>
