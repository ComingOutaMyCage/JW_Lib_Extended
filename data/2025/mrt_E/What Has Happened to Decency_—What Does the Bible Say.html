<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Decency is in decline. Rude patients yell at doctors; disrespectful restaurant patrons berate servers; unruly passengers assault flight attendants; delinquent children mock, threaten, and attack teachers; and some politicians get involved in scandalous conduct while other politicians try to stress their own decency.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The Bible is a reliable guide for what constitutes decent behavior. It also explains why there is a lack of decency today.</p>
<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>What has happened to decency?</strong></h2>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The decline in decency—behavior that is good, moral, and acceptable—is being seen around the world.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>       According to a recent Gallup poll, Americans rated the state of moral values in the United States to be lower now than at any other time in the past 22 years.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">      <span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>       In another survey of more than 32,000 respondents in 28 countries, 65 percent said that the lack of basic human decency today is the worst they have ever seen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The Bible predicted the behavior that we see today.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>        “There will be difficult times in the last days. People will be selfish, greedy, boastful, and conceited; they will be insulting, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, . . . unkind, [and] violent.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-3</a>, <em>Good News Translation.</em></p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>A reliable guide to decent behavior</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>In a world where decency is in decline, millions have found the Bible to be an excellent guide to good behavior. Its moral advice is “always reliable, now and forever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:8-19:111:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 111:8</a>) Consider a few examples:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>        <strong>What the Bible says:</strong> “All things . . . that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> We should treat others kindly and respectfully, just as we want to be treated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>        <strong>What the Bible says:</strong> “Now that you have put away deceit, each one of you speak truth with his neighbor.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:25-49:4:25" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> We should be honest in all that we say and do.</p>
