<blockquote><p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><em>“When I was a child, my brother abused me physically and verbally every single day. After I married, my mother-in-law continued the assaults. She and my father-in-law treated me as a slave. I battled thoughts of suicide.”—Madhu,</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> <em>India.</em></p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>“Violence against women is pervasive globally,” confirms the <em>World Health Organization.</em> It estimates that almost one in three women experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>If that has happened to you, you might feel at risk of verbal abuse or of physical or sexual violence wherever you go. As a result of such gender-based violence and mistreatment, you may feel that most people think ‘Women don’t matter.’ But do women really matter to God?</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What is God’s view of women?</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Scripture:</strong> “Male and female [God] created them.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Meaning:</strong> God created men <em>and</em> women. He views them both as worthy of respect. In addition, he expects a husband to “love his wife as he does himself,” not to try and control her, certainly not with harsh words or violence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:19-51:3:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:19</a>) Clearly, the safety of women matters to God.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“As a child, I was sexually abused by relatives. When I was 17, my employer threatened to fire me if I did not have sex with him. As an adult, I have been belittled by my husband, parents, and neighbors.
