<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>As the conflict in Ukraine has highlighted, many Christian leaders actively promote war. Note how the clergy support both sides of the conflict:</p>
<ul><li><blockquote><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>           “Great honors and gratitude to all our warriors defending their native Ukraine from the aggressor . . . Our hearts, sincere prayers, and support are always near you.”—Metropolitan Epiphanius I of Kyiv, as reported in <em>The Jerusalem Post,</em> March 16, 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>             “The head of the Russian Orthodox Church held a service for Russian soldiers on Sunday in which he called on them to defend their country ‘as only Russians can’ as Moscow continues its military campaign in Ukraine.”—Reuters, April 3, 2022.</p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>What the Bible really says</strong></h2>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The Bible shows that those who truly follow Jesus Christ do not engage in warfare.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>            “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:52-40:26:52" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 26:52</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>Is a person who condones war or fights in war really obeying Jesus’ words?</em></p>

<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>            “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, you also love one another.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Is it realistic for Christians to avoid engaging in warfare today? Yes. The Bible foretold that in our time, a period called “<a class="xt" data-xtid="76" href="jwpub://p/E:502016185/">the last days</a>,” there would be <a class="xt" data-xtid="132" href="jwpub://p/E:502013257/">people from all nations</a> who would not “learn war anymore,” in harmony with Jesus’ teachings.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4</a>, footnote.</p>
