Fight Loneliness With Friendship—⁠How the Bible Can Help


The fight against loneliness became a global health priority in 2023. Can this fight be won?
             “Loneliness and isolation represent profound threats to our health and well-being,” says Dr. Vivek Murthy, U.S. surgeon general. But he adds: “We have the power to respond.” How? “By taking small steps every day to strengthen our relationships.”a


Loneliness is not only the result of isolation. Some may feel lonely in a crowd. Whatever the cause of our loneliness, the Bible can help. It contains practical advice that can help us fight loneliness by strengthening our friendships.
Bible principles that can help
Be a good communicator. This includes not only sharing your own feelings but also being a good listener. The more interest you show in others, the stronger your relationships will be.
             Bible principle: “Look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”—Philippians 2:4.


Widen your circle of friends. Be willing to make friends with people who are older or younger than you or who have a different cultural background or nationality.
              Bible principle: “Open your hearts wide.”—2 Corinthians 6:13.
