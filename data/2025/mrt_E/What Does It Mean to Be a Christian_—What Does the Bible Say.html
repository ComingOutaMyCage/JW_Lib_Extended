<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Today many people around the world proudly identify themselves as Christians; yet, they act in ways that are hurtful to others. Some are selfish, dishonest, or unkind. Others may be unfaithful to their marriage partner. Their behavior causes some people to wonder: ‘What does it really mean to be a Christian?’</p>
<h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>What being a Christian really means</strong></h2>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>It is easy for a person to say that he is a Christian. But more is involved. According to the Bible, a Christian is someone who is a disciple of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:26-44:11:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 11:26</a>) Jesus himself said: “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:31-43:8:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 8:31</a>) Of course, no one can obey Jesus’ words perfectly. But a Christian strives to follow Jesus’ teachings and to live each day in a way that reflects his values. Consider some examples.</p>
