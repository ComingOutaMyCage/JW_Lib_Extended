<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p2" data-pid="2"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Once each year, Jehovah’s Witnesses and millions of their guests around the world gather to observe the Memorial of Jesus’ death, just as he commanded. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) This event helps us to appreciate the significance of what Jesus did when he gave his life for humankind. It also shows what his sacrifice can mean for us—both now and in the future.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Whether you attended the Memorial this year or not, how can you benefit from Jesus’ sacrificial death? Jesus taught that we should do two important things:</p>
<ol class="source"><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="txtSrcBullet"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>1.</strong> </span><strong>Learn about God and Jesus.</strong> In prayer to his heavenly Father, Jesus said: “This means everlasting life, their coming to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="txtSrcBullet"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>2.</strong> </span><strong>Act on what you learn.</strong> Jesus emphasized that we need to apply his teachings in our life. For example, he concluded his famous Sermon on the Mount by commending anyone who “hears [his] words and <strong>does</strong> them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:46-42:6:48" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 6:46-48</a>) Likewise, on another occasion, he said: “If you know these things, happy you are if you <strong>do</strong> them.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:17-43:13:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:17</a>.</p>
