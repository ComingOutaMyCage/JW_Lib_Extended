<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>Why look to the Bible for help in overcoming addiction?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Researchers have found that addiction is often associated with such deep-seated issues as loneliness, stress, anxiety, and depression. The Bible can help you to build the faith needed to cope successfully with the challenges that may contribute to addiction. It shows how you can have a close friendship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>) With his help, you can overcome problems that might seem impossible to solve on your own.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:22-41:11:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 11:22-24</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:23</a>) God’s thoughts are found in the Bible, so it is vital that you read it regularly.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Joseph Ehrenbogen</strong> was raised around violence and became addicted to alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and heroin. Several times, he nearly died from overdoses. One Bible passage in particular convinced him that he could change. Read his story in the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="126" href="jwpub://p/E:2016090/">I Learned to Respect Women and Myself</a>.”</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Dmitry Korshunov</strong> suffered many relapses in his struggle to break free from alcohol addiction. Watch the video <em>‘I Got Fed Up With My Lifestyle’</em> to see what helped him to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="p35" data-pid="35"><strong>Does the Bible forbid medical treatment for addiction?</strong></h2>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>No. The Bible acknowledges: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:12-40:9:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 9:12</a>) Likewise, the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse says: “Drug addiction is a complex disease, and quitting usually takes more than good intentions or a strong will.” Of course, the help that God provides is far stronger than anyone’s willpower. Still, many who have broken free from substance addiction by following the Bible’s counsel also needed the help of medical treatment.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> For instance, a man named Allen recalls: “When I was giving up alcohol, the physical pain of withdrawal was tremendous. That’s when I realized that I needed medical treatment in addition to the spiritual help I was getting.”</p>
<h2 id="p37" data-pid="37"><strong>Does the Bible forbid the medicinal use of drugs?</strong></h2>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>No. In fact, the Bible describes the use of <a class="xt" data-xtid="127" href="jwpub://p/E:502015240/">alcohol</a> to treat illness or to dull the pain of someone who is about to die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:31:6-20:31:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:23-54:5:23" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 5:23</a>) However, just as is true of alcohol, drugs that are used to manage pain can be highly addictive. Thus, it is wise to see the potential danger and exercise caution in the use of prescription painkillers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>.</p>
