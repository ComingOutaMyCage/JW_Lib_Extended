<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“The world economy is again in danger,” warns the president of the World Bank Group in a June 2022 report. “This time it is facing high inflation and slow growth at the same time.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>“Fuel and food prices have increased rapidly, hitting vulnerable populations in low-income countries hardest,” notes the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible helps us to understand why we are facing such challenging economic problems, how we can cope with them, and what hope there is for a permanent solution.</p>
<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Rising prices during “the last days”</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>           The Bible calls the time that we are living in “the last days.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>           Jesus said that “fearful sights,” or frightening events, would mark this time period. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:11-42:21:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) Soaring inflation causes fear. People worry about their future and whether they will be able to provide for their family.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>             The book of Revelation foretold rising food prices during this period of time. “I heard something that sounded like a voice. . . . It said, ‘A quart of wheat or three quarts of barley will cost a full day’s pay.’”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:6-66:6:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 6:6</a>, <em>Easy-to-Read Version.</em></p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>God will soon bring an end to unfair economic conditions, not just in one country but around the world. To see how, read the article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:501100030/">Is a Fair Economic System Possible?</a>”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>But even today, the Bible can help you to deal with rising prices. In what way?
