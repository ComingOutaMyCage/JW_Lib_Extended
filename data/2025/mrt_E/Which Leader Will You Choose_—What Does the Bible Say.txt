KEEP ON THE WATCH!
Which Leader Will You Choose?—What Does the Bible Say?


People are making important decisions about which leaders they will choose.
What does the Bible say?
Human leaders are limited
The Bible identifies a limitation that all human leaders have.
               “Do not put your trust in princes nor in a son of man, who cannot bring salvation. His breath goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish.”—Psalm 146:3, 4, footnote.


Even the most capable leaders will eventually die. Furthermore, they cannot guarantee that any of their good works will be continued by those who come after them.—Ecclesiastes 2:18, 19.
The fact is, the Bible reveals that humans were never meant to govern themselves.
              “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.


Is there anyone who can provide good leadership today?
A leader approved by God
The Bible explains that God has appointed a most capable and trustworthy leader: Jesus Christ. (Psalm 2:6) Jesus is the King of God’s Kingdom, a government that rules from heaven.—Matthew 6:10.
Will you choose to accept Jesus’ leadership? The Bible highlights the significance of that choice:
               “Honor the son [Jesus Christ], or God will become indignant and you will perish from the way, for His anger flares up quickly. Happy are all those taking refuge in Him.”—Psalm 2:12.


Now is the time to make your decision. Bible prophecy reveals that Jesus began ruling in the year 1914 and that soon God’s Kingdom will replace all human governments.—Daniel 2:44.
