<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>People are making important decisions about which leaders they will choose.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>What does the Bible say?</p>
<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Human leaders are limited</strong></h2>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible identifies a limitation that all human leaders have.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7">        <span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>       “Do not put your trust in princes nor in a son of man, who cannot bring salvation. His breath goes out, he returns to the ground; on that very day his thoughts perish.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a>, footnote.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Even the most capable leaders will eventually die. Furthermore, they cannot guarantee that any of their good works will be continued by those who come after them.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:18-21:2:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The fact is, the Bible reveals that humans were <em>never</em> meant to govern themselves.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>       “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Is there anyone who can provide good leadership today?</p>
<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>A leader approved by God</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>The Bible explains that God has appointed a most capable and trustworthy leader: Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:6-19:2:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6</a>) Jesus is the King of <a class="xt" data-xtid="102" href="jwpub://p/E:502012120/">God’s Kingdom</a>, a government that rules from heaven.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Will you choose to accept Jesus’ leadership? The Bible highlights the significance of that choice:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15">       <span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>        “Honor the son [Jesus Christ], or God will become indignant and you will perish from the way, for His anger flares up quickly. Happy are all those taking refuge in Him.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:12-19:2:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 2:12</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Now is the time to make your decision.
