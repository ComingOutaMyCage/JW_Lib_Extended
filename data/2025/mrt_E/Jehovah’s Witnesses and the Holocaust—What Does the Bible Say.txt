Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Holocaust—What Does the Bible Say?


On January 27, 2023, many people will observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The atrocities that occurred over 75 years ago may cause you to wonder why God allowed the Holocaust to happen.
             To find out what the Bible says, read the article “Why Did the Holocaust Happen? Why Didn’t God Stop It?”


The Jewish people suffered terribly as victims of the Holocaust. Millions were systematically murdered. Members of other groups were also targeted and killed during the time of the Holocaust. Among them were Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were persecuted for their Bible-based beliefs.

“A future and a hope”
Many people fear that an event such as the Holocaust could occur again. Thankfully, the Bible points to a future when such tragedies will no longer happen.
              “‘For I well know the thoughts that I am thinking toward you,’ declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity, to give you a future and a hope.’”—Jeremiah 29:11.a


This hope will be realized when Jehovah God acts to end evil and undo the damage that it has caused. He will soon:
              Remove those who wickedly harm others.—Proverbs 2:22.

              Heal all those who have suffered.—Revelation 21:4.

               Bring those who have died back to life on earth.—John 5:28, 29.
