Health Care—What God’s Kingdom Will Do


“The end of COVID-19 as a global health emergency is not the end of COVID-19 as a global health threat.. . . When the next pandemic comes knocking—and it will—we must be ready.”—Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, May 22, 2023.

Many people continue to struggle with physical and mental health effects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Will governments and health-care institutions be prepared for the next pandemic, let alone address our current health problems?
The Bible points to a government that will provide the health care we need. It says that “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom,” or government. (Daniel 2:44) Under that government, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” (Isaiah 33:24) Everyone will enjoy good health and youthful energy.—Job 33:25.
