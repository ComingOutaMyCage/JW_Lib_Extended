Environmental Problems—What God’s Kingdom Will Do


“The climate emergency is frazzling people, cities and ecosystems. Powerful storms, lent greater ferocity by the changing climate, are destroying homes and livelihoods across the world. Ocean ecosystems are warming, threatening mass species [die-off].”—Inger Andersen, under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive director of the UN Environment Programme, July 25, 2023.

Will governments be able to come together to address these global issues? Are they capable of providing lasting solutions?
The Bible speaks of a government that can and will solve all the earth’s environmental problems. It says that “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom,” a government to administer all of earth’s affairs. (Daniel 2:44) Under that world government, people “will not cause any harm or any ruin” to one another or to the earth.—Isaiah 11:9.
