<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>The Gospel accounts mention a man called John the Baptist, who preached in Judea regarding God’s Kingdom. Is the Bible’s record of this man accurate? Consider:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  The Bible says: “John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying: ‘Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:1-40:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 3:1, 2</a>) Can this statement be confirmed by secular sources? Yes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The first-century historian Flavius Josephus described a man named “John, surnamed the Baptist,” who “exhorted the Jews to lead righteous lives,” to practice “piety towards God,” and “to join in baptism.”—<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> Book XVIII.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  The Bible relates that John reproved Herod Antipas, who was district ruler in Galilee and Perea. Herod was nominally a Jew professing to be under the Law. John criticized Herod for marrying his half brother’s wife Herodias. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:18-41:6:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 6:18</a>) This detail likewise finds support outside the Bible.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Historian Josephus said that Antipas “[fell] in love with Herodias” and “brazenly broached to her the subject of marriage.” Herodias accepted and left her husband to marry Antipas.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  The Bible reports that “the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the country around the Jordan were going out to [John], and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:5-40:3:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Josephus likewise supports this detail, writing that people came in “crowds” to see John and that “they were aroused [or, uplifted] to the highest degree by his sermons.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Clearly, the first-century historian Josephus viewed John the Baptist as a real person. So can we.</p>
