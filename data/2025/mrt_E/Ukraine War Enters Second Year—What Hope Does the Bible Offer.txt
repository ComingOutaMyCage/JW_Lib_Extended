KEEP ON THE WATCH!
Ukraine War Enters Second Year—What Hope Does the Bible Offer?


Friday, February 24, 2023, marks a grim anniversary—one year since the war in Ukraine began. According to some reports, about 300,000 Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded and about 30,000 civilians are believed to have died in the war. However, the total may be higher.
Sadly, an end to this war does not appear to be in sight.
             “Nearly a year since Russian forces rolled into Ukraine, there are no real signs of a way out of the conflict. Neither side appears primed for an outright military victory, and progress at the negotiating table seems just as unlikely.”—NPR (National Public Radio), February 19, 2023.


Many people are rightly distressed by the pain and suffering that this and other conflicts are inflicting on innocent people around the world. What hope does the Bible offer? Will there ever be an end to war?
A war that will end all wars
The Bible speaks of a war that will save mankind, not destroy it. That war is known as Armageddon, and it is described as “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (Revelation 16:14, 16) By means of that war, God will bring an end to human rulership, which has caused so many destructive wars. To learn how Armageddon will result in lasting peace, read the following articles:
              “What Is the Battle of Armageddon?”

              “Armageddon Is Good News!”


Jehovah’s Witnesses are neutral
Jehovah’s Witnesses patiently look forward to the day when war will be no more, as promised in the Bible. (Psalm 46:9) In the meantime, we remain politically neutral and avoid warfare. Read about our relief efforts in Ukraine to see how we are helping our fellow believers and others who have been affected by this conflict.—Galatians 6:10.
