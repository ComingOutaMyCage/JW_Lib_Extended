Political Violence—⁠What Does the Bible Say?


Violence against public officials has become more common.
Why is there so much political violence? Will it ever end? What does the Bible say?
Political division foretold
The Bible predicted that in our time, referred to as “the last days,” many people would have attitudes that foster violence and disagreement.
              “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be . . . unthankful, disloyal, . . . not open to any agreement, . . . fierce, . . . betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride.”—2 Timothy 3:1-4.


The Bible also foretold that disturbances such as insurrections and political turmoil would be a feature of this time period. (Luke 21:9, footnote) Yet, political violence and division will not last forever.
The end of political violence
The Bible explains that God will replace all human governments with his own heavenly government.
              “The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that . . . will crush and put an end to all these [other] kingdoms, and it alone will stand forever.”—Daniel 2:44.


God’s Kingdom will truly unite people and establish peace worldwide.
              Its Ruler, Jesus Christ, is called the “Prince of Peace,” and he will ensure that “to peace, there will be no end.”—Isaiah 9:6, 7.

               Even now, its subjects are learning how to live in peace. As a result, the Bible says: “They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore.”—Isaiah 2:3, 4.
