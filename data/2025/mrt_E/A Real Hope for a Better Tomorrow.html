<h2 id="p34" data-pid="34"><strong>Is the hope the Bible offers us too good to be true?</strong></h2>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>Understandably, you may feel that it is. However, we encourage you to examine further what the Bible says about the future. Why? The promises found in the Bible are different from the promises and predictions that people make. The promises found in the Bible are from God. Here is why that makes a big difference:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>  <strong>God is trustworthy.</strong> The Bible says that God “cannot lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:2-56:1:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Titus 1:2</a>) In addition, only God has the ability to foretell the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:10-23:46:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:10</a>) The Bible contains countless examples that prove that what God foretells always comes true. For more information, watch the video <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502015752&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502015752&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>How Can We Be Sure the Bible Is True?</em></a></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"></span>  <strong>God has the power to solve our problems.</strong> The Bible says that God has the power to do “everything he pleases to do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:5-19:135:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 135:5, 6</a>) In other words, nothing can stop God from fulfilling his promises. What is more, God wants to help us because he loves us.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span>Naturally, you may wonder, ‘If God wants to help us and has the power to help us, why do we still experience so many problems?’ To answer that question, watch the video <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502018850&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502018850&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>Why Does God Allow Suffering?</em></a></p>
<h2 id="p39" data-pid="39"><strong>How will this hope come about?</strong></h2>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span>God will use his Kingdom, a government in heaven, to fulfill his promises. He has appointed Jesus Christ as Ruler of that Kingdom, and he has given him authority to care for the earth and the people on it. When Jesus was on earth, he cured the sick, fed the hungry, controlled the weather, and even resurrected the dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:39-41:4:39" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Mark 4:39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:41-41:6:44" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 6:41-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:40-42:4:40" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Luke 4:40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:43-43:11:44" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> John 11:43, 44</a>) He thus showed what he would do as King of God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"></span>Watch the video <a data-link-type="fallback" data-video="webpubvid://?docid=502017850&amp;track=1" href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=502017850&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E"><em>What Is God’s Kingdom?</em></a> to learn more about how God’s Kingdom will benefit you.</p>
<h2 id="p42" data-pid="42"><strong>When will this hope be fulfilled?</strong></h2>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"></span>Soon! How can we be sure? The Bible foretold events that would signal that God’s Kingdom is about to begin its rule over the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 21:10, 11</a>) Present world conditions match what the Bible foretold.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"></span>To learn more, read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="103" href="jwpub://p/E:2020087/">When Will God’s Kingdom Rule the Earth?</a>”</p>
<h2 id="p45" data-pid="45"><strong>How can the hope the Bible offers us help you today?</strong></h2>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"></span>One Bible writer compared the hope that the Bible gives to an “anchor for the soul.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:19-58:6:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:19</a>) Just as an anchor keeps a ship steady during a storm, the Bible’s solid hope for the future can help us weather the problems we face today. Our hope can protect our emotional and mental stability, and even our physical well-being.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:8-52:5:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>.</p>
