<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Consider the following regarding prominent religious leaders and the war in Ukraine:</p>
<ul><li><blockquote><p id="p4" data-pid="4"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  “The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, has not said a word against Russian aggression. . . . His Church’s systematic propaganda campaign about Ukraine has been utilised in Putin’s justification for war.”—EUobserver, March 7, 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p id="p5" data-pid="5"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  “Patriarch Kirill . . . has sent his strongest signal yet justifying his country’s invasion of Ukraine—describing the conflict as part of a struggle against sin.”—AP News, March 8, 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p id="p6" data-pid="6"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  “Ukrainian Orthodox Church leader, Metropolitan Epiphanius I of Kyiv, on Monday blessed his people to ‘fight against the Russian invaders’ . . . [He] also stated that killing Russian soldiers isn’t a sin.”—Jerusalem Post, March 16, 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><blockquote><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  “We [the Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organizations (UCCRO)] support the Armed Forces of Ukraine and all our defenders, we bless them in their defense of Ukraine from the aggressor, and offer our prayers for them.”—UCCRO<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Statement, February 24, 2022.</p>

</ul>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>What do you think? Should religions that claim to follow Jesus Christ encourage their members to go to war? What does the Bible say?</p>
<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>The history of religion in war</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>History shows that religion has often condoned, justified, or even promoted war while pretending to work for peace. For decades, Jehovah’s Witnesses have exposed such religious hypocrisy. Consider some examples cited in our publications.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  “<a class="xt" data-xtid="140" href="jwpub://p/E:101997724/">The Crusades—A ‘Tragic Illusion’</a>” shows how the Roman Catholic Church was responsible for massacres committed in the name of God and of Christ.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  “<a class="xt" data-xtid="141" href="jwpub://p/E:101994927/">The Catholic Church in Africa</a>” describes an example of how religion failed to prevent tribal warfare, even genocide.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  The articles “<a class="xt" data-xtid="142" href="jwpub://p/E:102011019/">Is Religion to Blame?</a>,” “<a class="xt" data-xtid="143" href="jwpub://p/E:101993281/">Religion’s Role in Man’s Wars</a>,” and “<a class="xt" data-xtid="144" href="jwpub://p/E:101994761/">Religion Takes Sides</a>” explain how Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant clergy have supported <em>both</em> sides of many wars.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Should Christian religions support war?</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>What Jesus taught:</strong> “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39</a>) “Continue to love your enemies.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:44-40:5:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:44-47</a>.</p>
<div id="tt19" class="borderSolid--bottom">
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Consider:</strong> Can a religion claim to obey Jesus’ commands about love and at the same time encourage its adherents to kill others in war? For the answer, read the articles “<a class="xt" data-xtid="145" href="jwpub://p/E:101994762/">True Christians and War</a>” and “<a class="xt" data-xtid="146" href="jwpub://p/E:102009406/">Is It Possible to Love One’s Enemies?</a>”</p>
</div>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>What Jesus said:</strong> “My Kingdom is no part of this world. If my Kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be handed over.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) “All those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:47-40:26:52" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 26:47-52</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Consider:</strong> If Christians were not to fight even to protect Jesus, should they take up arms for any other reason? Read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="147" href="jwpub://p/E:2009731/">Is War Compatible With Christianity?</a>” to see how early Christians faithfully followed Jesus’ example and teachings.</p>
<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>What will happen to religions that promote warfare?</strong></h2>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>The Bible teaches that God rejects religions that claim to represent Jesus yet do not follow his teachings.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 7:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:16-56:1:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Titus 1:16</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  The book of Revelation shows that God holds such religions responsible for the deaths “of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:21-66:18:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 18:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:24-66:18:24" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 24</a>) To learn why, read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="148" href="jwpub://p/E:502015210/">What Is Babylon the Great?</a>”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  Jesus indicated that all religions rejected by God will be destroyed for their bad works, just as a rotten tree producing rotten fruit “is cut down and thrown into the fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:15-40:7:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 7:15-20</a>) Read the article “<a class="xt" data-xtid="149" href="jwpub://p/E:1102006290/">The End of False Religion Is Near!</a>” to learn how this will happen.</p>
