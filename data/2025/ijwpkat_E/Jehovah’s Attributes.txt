After watching the video, help your children to learn about Jehovah’s four primary attributes. Cut out the lion, eagle, bull, and man on page 1. Then match the shapes and paste them onto the village from the video on page 2. Discuss how each one represents a main attribute of Jehovah. For further discussion, see chapter 4 of the book Pure Worship of Jehovah—Restored At Last!
