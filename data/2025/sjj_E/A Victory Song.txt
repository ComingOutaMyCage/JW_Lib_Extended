SONG 149
A Victory Song

(Exodus 15:1)

1. Sing to Jehovah. His great name is highly exalted.
His proud Egyptian foes, He has cast into the sea.
Praise Jah Almighty;
Besides him there can be no other.
Jehovah is his name;
He has gained the victory.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, Most High over all,
The one who is forevermore the same,
You soon will cause your enemies to fall
And sanctify your holy name.


2. See now all nations Opposing the Sov’reign, Jehovah.
Though mightier than Pharaoh,
They too will suffer shame.
Judgment awaits them;
They cannot escape Armageddon.
Soon ev’ryone will know
That Jehovah is God’s name.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, Most High over all,
The one who is forevermore the same,
You soon will cause your enemies to fall
And sanctify your holy name.
