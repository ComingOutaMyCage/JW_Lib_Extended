SONG 33
Throw Your Burden on Jehovah

(Psalm 55)

1. “Listen to my prayer,” Jehovah.
Let yourself be found by me.
Feel the anguish deep inside me;
Help me unafraid to be.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
Trust in him to sustain and save you.
He will always give protection.
He is loyal; he is true.


2. Had I wings just as a dove has,
Far from danger I would fly,
Safe from those who seek to hurt me,
Sheltered from their hateful cry.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
Trust in him to sustain and save you.
He will always give protection.
He is loyal; he is true.


3. Comfort from our God, Jehovah,
Always brings us peace of mind.
He will help us bear our burden.
He is loving; he is kind.
(CHORUS)
Throw your burden on Jehovah;
Trust in him to sustain and save you.
He will always give protection.
He is loyal; he is true.
