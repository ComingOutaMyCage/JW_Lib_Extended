SONG 37
Serving Jehovah Whole-Souled

(Matthew 22:37)

1. O Jehovah, Sov’reign Ruler,
You are the one I love and obey.
You deserve my full devotion;
You are my God; I’ll serve you each day.
Your commands I loyally follow;
How I love reminders from you!
(CHORUS)
O Jehovah, you are worthy;
Whole-souled devotion I give to you.


2. Father, all your works exalt you.
Earth, moon, and stars your glory proclaim.
May I also be as faithful,
Using my strength to make known your name.
May I use my whole life to serve you,
Proving to be loyal and true.
(CHORUS)
O Jehovah, you are worthy;
Whole-souled devotion I give to you.
