SONG 32
Take Sides With Jehovah!

(Exodus 32:26)

1. Once with confusion our sad hearts were filled,
Drinking the cup false religion distilled;
But with what happiness our hearts were thrilled
When of God’s Kingdom we heard.
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah; Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you; Walk on in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus Will ever increase.


2. Shoulder to shoulder we stand on God’s side,
Preaching the news of his Kingdom earth wide.
Now is the time for each one to decide,
Time to take sides with our God.
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah; Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you; Walk on in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus Will ever increase.


3. We will not fear what the Devil can do.
Trusting Jehovah will carry us through.
Though they are many and though we are few,
God is our strength and our might.
(CHORUS)
Take sides with Jehovah; Make him your delight.
He’ll never forsake you; Walk on in his light.
Tell, tell the glad tidings Of freedom and peace.
His rule by Christ Jesus Will ever increase.
