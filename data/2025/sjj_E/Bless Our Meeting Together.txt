Bless Our Meeting Together

(Hebrews 10:24, 25)

1. Bless us as we meet together,
O Jehovah, we now pray.
We are thankful for our meetings;
May your spirit with us stay.

2. Help us, Lord, refine our worship;
With your Word, oh, do us fill.
Train our minds and tongues to witness;
Love within our hearts instill.

3. Loving Father, bless our meetings;
Grant us peace and unity.
May our words and may our actions
Magnify your Sov’reignty.
