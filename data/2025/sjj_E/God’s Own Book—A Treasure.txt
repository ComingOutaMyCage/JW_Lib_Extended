God’s Own Book​—A Treasure

(Proverbs 2:1)

1. There is a book that by its many pages,
Brings peace and joy and hope to humankind.
Its wondrous thoughts are charged with such great power;
It brings life to the “dead,” sight to the “blind.”
That precious book is God’s own Holy Bible.
Its words were penned by men whom God inspired,
By men who truly loved their God Jehovah,
And by his holy spirit they were fired.

2. They wrote a record true of God’s creations,
How by his might this universe appeared.
They also told how man at first was sinless
But how his Paradise then disappeared.
They further told about a certain angel
Who challenged God and spurned his sov’reignty.
That challenge led to sin and man’s great sorrow,
But soon will come Jehovah’s victory.

3. The time has come with reason for rejoicing:
Jehovah rules by his anointed King.
So now we preach the good news of the Kingdom
And share the hope of blessings it will bring.
Within his book are found these cheerful tidings;
A sacred banquet feast on which to feed.
It offers peace beyond all human thinking;
This Living Treasure beckons all to read.
