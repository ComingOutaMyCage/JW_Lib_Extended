“It Will Not Be Late!”

(Habakkuk 2:3)

1. Beauty fills the earth,
wonder fills our mind—
The work of your hands
so patiently designed.
Though the world may change,
you remain the same.
You patiently wait
to make it new again.
(CHORUS)
Father, we long to see
Paradise come to be.
Give us the patience to wait.
We know your day will come,
sure as the rising sun.
No matter how long it takes,
“It will not be late!”


2. Faithfully we wait
for the dead to rise.
Jehovah, you yearn
to bring them back to life.
Father, we well know
how you loved them so.
Instill in our hearts
the patience you have shown.
(CHORUS)
Father, we long to see
Paradise come to be.
Give us the patience to wait.
We know your day will come,
sure as the rising sun.
No matter how long it takes,
“It will not be late!”


3. Patiently you search;
honest hearts you find.
You heal them with hope
and long to give them life.
Working by your side,
sharing what is true,
We use our time well.
It draws us close to you.
(CHORUS)
Father, we long to see
Paradise come to be.
Give us the patience to wait.
We know your day will come,
sure as the rising sun.
No matter how long it takes,
“It will not be late!”
Father, please help us to wait!
