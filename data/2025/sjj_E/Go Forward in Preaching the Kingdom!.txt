SONG 69
Go Forward in Preaching the Kingdom!

(2 Timothy 4:5)

1. Go forward in preaching the Kingdom
To people in ev’ry land.
With love in your hearts for your neighbor,
Help meek ones to take their stand.
Our service to God is a priv’lege;
His word we are glad to proclaim.
Go out in the field and keep preaching;
Give witness to God’s holy name.
(CHORUS)
Forward, boldly preach the
Kingdom message ever far and wide.
Forward, faithful, loyally remaining
on Jehovah’s side.


2. Together we press ever forward,
Anointed and other sheep.
The old and the young men and women
In step with the truth do keep.
The good news of God’s coming Kingdom
Is something that all need to hear.
We preach in the strength of Jehovah;
With him there is nothing to fear!
(CHORUS)
Forward, boldly preach the
Kingdom message ever far and wide.
Forward, faithful, loyally remaining
on Jehovah’s side.
