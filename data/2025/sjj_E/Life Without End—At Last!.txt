SONG 140
Life Without End​—At Last!

(John 3:16)

1. Can you see with your mind’s eye,
Peoples dwelling together?
Sorrow has passed. Peace at last!
Life without tears or pain.
(CHORUS)
Sing out with joy of heart!
You too can have a part.
Live for the day when you’ll say,
“Life without end, at last!”


2. In those days all will be young,
All at peace with Jehovah.
Troubles are gone, from now on,
No need to weep or fear.
(CHORUS)
Sing out with joy of heart!
You too can have a part.
Live for the day when you’ll say,
“Life without end, at last!”


3. Paradise all will enjoy
As we sing of God’s glory.
Long as we live, we will give
Honor and praise to God.
(CHORUS)
Sing out with joy of heart!
You too can have a part.
Live for the day when you’ll say,
“Life without end, at last!”
