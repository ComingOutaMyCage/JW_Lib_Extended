“Exercise Patience”

(James 5:8)

1. Our Sov’reign Lord Jehovah
Is zealous for his holy name.
He fervently desires
To clear it from unrighteous blame.
Through many generations,
Great endurance he has shown;
In loving, kindly patience,
Not weary has he grown.
His will is that salvation
All sorts of people might attain.
Long-lasting, loving patience
By God will not have been in vain.

2. The quality of patience
Will help us on our godly path.
It lets our heart be tranquil,
Protects us from unrighteous wrath.
It finds the good in others,
Always hoping for the best.
It helps us keep our balance
In times when we’re distressed.
Along with other virtues
That holy spirit can bestow,
Our patience will assist us
To imitate the God we know.
