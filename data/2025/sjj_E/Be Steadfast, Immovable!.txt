SONG 122
Be Steadfast, Immovable!

(1 Corinthians 15:58)

1. Nations are troubled as never before.
People are fearful of what lies in store.
Firm and immovable we need to be,
Serving our God faithfully.
(CHORUS)
Steadfast we all need to be;
Far from this world we keep free,
Standing firm to the end,
Unending life we’ll see.


2. Snares of the world and temptations abound.
We can resist if our thinking is sound.
Hating what’s bad while we love what is true
Makes us immovable too.
(CHORUS)
Steadfast we all need to be;
Far from this world we keep free,
Standing firm to the end,
Unending life we’ll see.


3. Give to God worship that comes from the heart.
In the Lord’s service may we have a part.
Preach the good news, always holding it fast.
Soon the last days will have passed.
(CHORUS)
Steadfast we all need to be;
Far from this world we keep free,
Standing firm to the end,
Unending life we’ll see.




(See also Luke 21:9; 1 Pet. 4:7.)
