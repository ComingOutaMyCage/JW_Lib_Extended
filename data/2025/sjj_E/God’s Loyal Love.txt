God’s Loyal Love

(Isaiah 55:1-3)

1. Loyal love! God is love.
We can sense his care from above.
God by means of his precious Son
Paid the ransom for ev’ryone,
Giving hope that we might possess
Life eternal and happiness.
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loyal love you’ll see.


2. Loyal love! God is love.
All his works give proof of his love.
Love Jehovah has further shown,
Giving Jesus the kingly throne.
God’s own purpose has come to pass.
See! His Kingdom is here at last!
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loyal love you’ll see.


3. Loyal love! God is love.
May his spirit move us to love.
As we loyally help the meek,
God’s commandments they learn to keep.
We are serving with godly fear,
Preaching boldly for all to hear.
(CHORUS)
Hey there, all you thirsty ones,
Come and drink life’s water free.
Yes, come drink, you thirsty ones;
God’s loyal love you’ll see.
