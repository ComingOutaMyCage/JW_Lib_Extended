“A Perfect Wage” From Jehovah

(Ruth 2:12)

1. Jehovah is faithful and fully aware
Of all those who serve him whole-souled.
He knows there are times their devotion and zeal
Result in their loss as foretold.
If you have left houses or fam’ly or friends,
Be sure that our God knows the sum.
He makes it up now with our dear brotherhood
And life in the new world to come.
(CHORUS)
May Jehovah reward what you have done.
May he provide a perfect wage for you.
May you find refuge beneath his wings.
Jehovah is faithful; Jehovah is true.


2. At times we may feel that our lot in this life
Has burdened us more than our share.
And sometimes it seems that the cares of the day
Are more than we’re able to bear.
The God of all comfort takes note of your need;
You know he’s the Hearer of prayer.
His Word and his spirit and true, loving friends
Will bring to you comfort and care.
(CHORUS)
May Jehovah reward what you have done.
May he provide a perfect wage for you.
May you find refuge beneath his wings.
Jehovah is faithful; Jehovah is true.
