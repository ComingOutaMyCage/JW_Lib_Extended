We Need Self-Control

(Romans 7:14-25)

1. We love Jehovah with heart, mind, and soul;
But since we are sinful, we need self-control.
Fleshly desires bring trouble and strife;
Living by spirit brings peace and life.

2. Satan’s temptations confront us each day,
And sin’s law within us can lead us astray.
Power of truth is greater than sin.
Thanks to Jehovah, our minds can win.

3. Each word and action reflects on God’s name,
So we must endeavor to keep free from blame.
In all we do, we make this our goal:
Always maintaining our self-control.
