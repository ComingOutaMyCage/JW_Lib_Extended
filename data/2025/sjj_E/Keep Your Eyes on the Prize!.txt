SONG 144
Keep Your Eyes on the Prize!

(2 Corinthians 4:18)

1. When the eyes of blind ones see again
And the ears of deaf ones hear again,
When the songs of children fill the air
And joy and peace are ev’rywhere,
When our loved ones will return to life,
To an earth that’s free from sin and strife,
(CHORUS)
You will see how God these things supplies,
If you keep your eyes on the prize.


2. When the wolves and lambs will feed as one,
When the bears and calves bask in the sun,
Then a mere young boy will lead them all,
And they will heed his childish call.
When our tears belong to yesterday,
When our fears and pain have passed away,
(CHORUS)
You will see how God these things supplies,
If you keep your eyes on the prize.
