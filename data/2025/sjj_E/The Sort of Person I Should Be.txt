SONG 127
The Sort of Person I Should Be

(2Â Peter 3:11)

1. How can I repay you, what gift can I give
To thank you, Jehovah, for the life that I live?
I look in my heart with your Word as my mirror;
The person I see, may you help me see clearer.
(BRIDGE)
My life I have promised in service to you,
But not from mere duty will I do what I do.
Whole-souled and wholehearted I serve you by choice;
May I be one more who makes you rejoice.
Help me to examine, and help me to see
Just what sort of person you desire me to be.
Those loyal to you, you will loyally treasure;
May I be among those who bring your heart pleasure.
