SONG 134
Children Are a Trust From God

(Psalm 127:3-5)

1. When a man becomes a father
And a woman has a child of her own,
They share a trust, they must remember,
That is not theirs, not theirs alone.
The gift they share is from Jehovah;
Of life and love he is the one true Source.
To parents he gives sure direction
That they may follow the wisest course.
(CHORUS)
A sacred trust you have been given;
A precious life is in your hands.
You can bestow the greatest favor;
Instruct your child in God’s commands.


2. All the words God has commanded—
They must always prove to be on your heart.
These words you’ll speak to sons and daughters;
This is your trust, this is your part.
To them you’ll speak along your roadway,
When you rise up and when you are at rest.
In years to come, may they remember,
May they be faithful, may they be blessed.
(CHORUS)
A sacred trust you have been given;
A precious life is in your hands.
You can bestow the greatest favor;
Instruct your child in God’s commands.
