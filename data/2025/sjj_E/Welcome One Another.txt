Welcome One Another

(Romans 15:7)

1. Welcome to all who gather here this day
To hear God’s Word and to learn his way.
Life-giving truth he offers to us all;
With thankfulness of heart, we respond to his call.

2. Thanks to our God for brothers such as these,
Who welcome us and who seek to please.
May we keep holding men of that sort dear,
And now we welcome others who meet with us here.

3. God’s invitation reaches all mankind,
That all sincere ones the truth may find.
God by his Son has drawn us to His side.
So welcome one another with hearts opened wide.



(See also John 6:44; Phil. 2:29; Rev. 22:17.)
