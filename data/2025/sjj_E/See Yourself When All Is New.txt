SONG 139
See Yourself When All Is New

(Revelation 21:1-5)

1. Just see yourself, just see me too;
Just see us all in a world that is new.
Think how you’ll feel, how it will be,
To live in peace, to be truly free.
No evil one will then prevail;
Rule by our God cannot ever fail.
The time will have come for a new earthly start,
The song of our praises
will pour out from our heart:
(CHORUS)
“We thank you, our God, for all you have done.
All things are new by the rule of your Son.
The fullness of our heart overflows in our song;
All glory and honor and praise to you belong.”


2. Now see yourself, and see me too;
And look ahead to a world that is new.
No sight we see, no sound we hear
Will cause alarm or give rise to fear.
All has come true, just as he said;
Now over mankind, his tent is spread.
He now will awaken those sleeping in death;
Their voices will join ours with
ev’ry grateful breath:
(CHORUS)
“We thank you, our God, for all you have done.
All things are new by the rule of your Son.
The fullness of our heart overflows in our song;
All glory and honor and praise to you belong.”
