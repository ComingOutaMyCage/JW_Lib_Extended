SONG 71
We Are Jehovah’s Army!

(Ephesians 6:11-14)

1. We are Jehovah’s army,
Under Christ, his Son.
Though we’re opposed by Satan,
We are marching as one.
We keep serving faithfully,
Preaching far and near;
We remain determined
With no hint of fear.
(CHORUS)
We are Jehovah’s army;
With his Christ we’re one,
Joyfully declaring,
“God’s rule has begun.”


2. We are Jehovah’s servants,
Searching for his sheep,
Those who are lost and scattered,
Those who sigh and who weep.
These we try to find and feed
With repeated calls;
These we keep inviting
To our Kingdom Halls.
(CHORUS)
We are Jehovah’s army;
With his Christ we’re one,
Joyfully declaring,
“God’s rule has begun.”


3. We are Jehovah’s army,
Under Christ’s command,
Fully equipped for battle,
Each one firmly will stand.
Cautious though we need to be,
Upright we remain.
In the face of danger,
Truth we will maintain.
(CHORUS)
We are Jehovah’s army;
With his Christ we’re one,
Joyfully declaring,
“God’s rule has begun.”
