“Good News”!

(Luke 2:10)

1. “Glory in the heights above”—
Good news for all men—
When God’s Son arrived in Bethlehem.
Hope for those who mourn,
A Savior has been born!
(CHORUS)
Good news, this good news—
Joy for all mankind—
Praise Jah for his light!
Good news, this good news—
Preach with all your might.
Good news, Christ is born—
The way, the truth, the life.


2. He will reign for righteousness.
Peace he will provide.
Jesus is the way to endless life.
Truth he will defend.
His Kingdom will not end.
(CHORUS)
Good news, this good news—
Joy for all mankind—
Praise Jah for his light!
Good news, this good news—
Preach with all your might.
Good news, Christ is born—
The way, the truth, the life.

(CHORUS)
Good news, this good news—
Joy for all mankind—
Praise Jah for his light!
Good news, this good news—
Preach with all your might.
Good news, Christ is born—
The way, the truth, the life.
