“Making All Things New”

(Revelation 21:1-5)

1. “The signs of the times” prove God’s rule has begun.
In glory enthroned sits Jehovah’s Son.
The heavens are cleansed, Satan’s now debased,
And soon on the earth let God’s will take place.
(CHORUS)
Rejoice! For God’s tent is with men,
And he himself resides with them.
No more will there be pain or worrying,
No sting of death nor any sorrowing.
For God has said: ‘I’m making all things new.’
These words faithful are and true.


2. Let all men the pure New Jerusalem see,
The bride of the Lamb shining radiantly.
Adorned for her husband in gems so bright,
And only Jehovah will be her light.
(CHORUS)
Rejoice! For God’s tent is with men,
And he himself resides with them.
No more will there be pain or worrying,
No sting of death nor any sorrowing.
For God has said: ‘I’m making all things new.’
These words faithful are and true.


3. This city so grand will become a delight.
Its gates will be open both day and night.
The nations will walk in her glory bright;
The servants of God now reflect that light.
(CHORUS)
Rejoice! For God’s tent is with men,
And he himself resides with them.
No more will there be pain or worrying,
No sting of death nor any sorrowing.
For God has said: ‘I’m making all things new.’
These words faithful are and true.
