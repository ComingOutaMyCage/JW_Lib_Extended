SONG 143
Keep Working, Watching, and Waiting

(Romans 8:20-25)

1. The God of times and of seasons,
Whose name alone is Jehovah—
The time for his vindication
Is near by signs we can see.
(CHORUS)
Keep on working and watching and waiting,
Joyfully anticipating,
Life as God meant it to be.


2. The time has long been appointed;
His Son is ready to conquer,
Defeating all who oppose him.
His sword will bring victory.
(CHORUS)
Keep on working and watching and waiting,
Joyfully anticipating,
Life as God meant it to be.


3. Though all creation is groaning,
In faith we’re eagerly waiting.
Jehovah’s day is approaching,
The time for setting us free.
(CHORUS)
Keep on working and watching and waiting,
Joyfully anticipating,
Life as God meant it to be.




(See also Matt. 25:13; Luke 12:36.)
