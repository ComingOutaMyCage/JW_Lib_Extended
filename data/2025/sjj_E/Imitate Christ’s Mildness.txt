Imitate Christ’s Mildness

(Matthew 11:28-30)

1. The greatest of men was our Lord Jesus Christ;
By pride or ambition, he was not enticed.
God’s purpose gave Jesus the prominent role;
Yet, lowly in heart, he was always whole-souled.

2. To all who are toiling with troublesome cares,
He offers to carry the burdens they bear.
Refreshment they find as the Kingdom they seek.
With kindness and mildness, he favors the meek.

3. ‘We all are just brothers,’ our Lord Jesus said.
In humble submission, we look to our Head.
The mild and the meek ones to God have great worth;
He promises they will inherit the earth.



(See also Prov. 3:34; Matt. 5:5; 23:8; Rom. 12:16.)
