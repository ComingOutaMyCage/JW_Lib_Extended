SONG 77
Light in a Darkened World

(2 Corinthians 4:6)

1. In these days, dark and lawless days,
Shines a light we can see.
Like the dawn of another day
That will soon come to be.
(CHORUS)
Shining through the darkness,
Ours is a message so bright.
It offers hope and light—
Sparkling like the daylight,
Bringing tomorrow in sight—
So ends the night.


2. Those who sleep need awakening
As the time ebbs away.
We give hope and encouragement.
For their future we’ll pray.
(CHORUS)
Shining through the darkness,
Ours is a message so bright.
It offers hope and light—
Sparkling like the daylight,
Bringing tomorrow in sight—
So ends the night.
