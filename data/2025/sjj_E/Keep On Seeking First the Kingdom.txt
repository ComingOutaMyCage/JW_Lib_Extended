SONG 21
Keep On Seeking First the Kingdom

(Matthew 6:33)

1. Something precious to Jehovah,
Bringing him such keen delight,
Is his Kingdom by Christ Jesus,
Which will set all matters right.
(CHORUS)
Keep on seeking first the Kingdom
And Jehovah’s righteousness.
Sing his praise among the nations,
Serving him in faithfulness.


2. Why be anxious for tomorrow,
‘Will we hunger, will we thirst?’
For our God will make provision
If we seek his Kingdom first.
(CHORUS)
Keep on seeking first the Kingdom
And Jehovah’s righteousness.
Sing his praise among the nations,
Serving him in faithfulness.


3. So declare the Kingdom good news;
Help deserving ones to see
That their hope is in Jehovah
And in his Theocracy.
(CHORUS)
Keep on seeking first the Kingdom
And Jehovah’s righteousness.
Sing his praise among the nations,
Serving him in faithfulness.
