We Must Be Taught

(Isaiah 50:4; 54:13)

1. Come with rejoicing, and learn about Jehovah.
“Come drink life’s water,” the spirit has said.
Healthful instruction, God has provided.
All those who hunger for truth will be fed.

2. Never forsaking our gathering together,
We must be taught; we must learn what is right.
Here with God’s spirit, here with our brothers,
Here we are strengthened to walk in the light.

3. Lips that sing praise, how encouraging to hear them!
Tongues of the taught ones, how sweet is their sound!
Oh, may we always meet with God’s people!
Oh, may we always among them be found!



(See also Heb. 10:24, 25; Rev. 22:17.)
