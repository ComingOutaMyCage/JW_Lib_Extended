Life Depends on God’s Word

(Matthew 4:4)

1. Life depends on Jehovah’s Word,
All the things he has said.
We must live not on bread alone;
Live by his Word instead.
Even now we have peace and joy,
Future blessings assured.
(CHORUS)
Man must live not on bread alone;
Life depends on God’s Word.
There we find what we daily need;
Life depends on God’s Word.


2. True accounts in God’s written Word
Tell about those of old.
Men and women who walked in faith—
They were loyal and bold.
We’re encouraged each time we read
All they did and endured.
(CHORUS)
Man must live not on bread alone;
Life depends on God’s Word.
There we find what we daily need;
Life depends on God’s Word.


3. Day by day as we read God’s Word,
He gives comfort and hope.
When the trials of life arise,
He gives wisdom to cope.
May we treasure within our heart
All we’ve read and we’ve heard.
(CHORUS)
Man must live not on bread alone;
Life depends on God’s Word.
There we find what we daily need;
Life depends on God’s Word.




(See also Josh. 1:8; Rom. 15:4.)
