“Make Sure of the More Important Things”

(Philippians 1:10)

1. How great our need today for discernment,
To know the things that are true,
To know which things have greater importance,
To know which things we must do!
(CHORUS)
Love what is good; Hate what is bad.
Make God’s heart glad;
Oh, what rich blessings it brings when we learn,
When we discern,
And when we do the important things!


2. And what could be of greater importance
Than sharing Kingdom good news,
To search for those who hunger for truth
And to help them God’s way to choose?
(CHORUS)
Love what is good; Hate what is bad.
Make God’s heart glad;
Oh, what rich blessings it brings when we learn,
When we discern,
And when we do the important things!


3. If we take care to do what’s important,
Then true contentment we’ll find.
The peace surpassing all understanding
Will guard our heart and our mind.
(CHORUS)
Love what is good; Hate what is bad.
Make God’s heart glad;
Oh, what rich blessings it brings when we learn,
When we discern,
And when we do the important things!
