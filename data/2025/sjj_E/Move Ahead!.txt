Move Ahead!

(Hebrews 6:1)

1. Move ahead, move ahead to maturity!
Shine the light of the truth so that all may plainly see.
Try your best to improve in your ministry;
Trust in God for true success.
There’s a place in the service for all.
It’s the work Jesus did, you’ll recall.
Look to God for support that you may not fall,
Standing firm for righteousness.

2. Move ahead, move ahead, boldly witnessing!
Everlasting good news to all sorts of people bring.
Join in praise to Jehovah, our God and King,
As we preach from door to door.
Though opposers would like us to fear,
Don’t hold back, but let ev’ryone hear.
Tell the news that the Kingdom of God is here.
Teach the truth yet more and more.

3. Move ahead, move ahead, always follow through,
And improve in your skills,
for there’s so much work to do.
Let the spirit of God keep on leading you.
Find the joy that is divine.
Love the people you work hard to find.
Keep returning to reach heart and mind.
And assist them to grow and to be refined,
So the light of truth will shine.
