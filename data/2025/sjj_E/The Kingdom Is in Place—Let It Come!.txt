SONG 22
The Kingdom Is in Place​—Let It Come!

(Revelation 11:15; 12:10)

1. Jehovah, you always have been,
And always you will be.
You’ve given the throne to your Son;
He rules by your decree.
The Kingdom has been brought to birth;
His rulership will fill the earth.
(CHORUS)
For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might.
The Kingdom is in place.
We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”


2. The time for the Devil is short;
We know what this will mean.
Though living in times of distress,
We see the things unseen.
The Kingdom has been brought to birth;
His rulership will fill the earth.
(CHORUS)
For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might.
The Kingdom is in place.
We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”


3. The angels in heaven rejoice
And sing with joyful cries.
The heavens above are relieved
From Satan and his lies.
The Kingdom has been brought to birth;
His rulership will fill the earth.
(CHORUS)
For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might.
The Kingdom is in place.
We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”
