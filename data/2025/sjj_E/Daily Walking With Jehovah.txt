Daily Walking With Jehovah

(Micah 6:8)

1. Hand in hand with our dear Father,
We would humbly walk with him each day.
Oh, how undeserved his kindness
That he grants to those who seek his way!
By his love God made provision;
We may freely take his hand.
So we make our dedication;
With Jehovah we take our stand.

2. In this day of Satan’s anger,
As the end is drawing ever near,
We are faced with opposition
That could make us turn away in fear.
But Jehovah gives protection;
Close to him we want to stay,
That we might forever serve him.
Love him loyally, never stray.

3. Help for us God has provided
Through his spirit and his written Word,
Through the Christian congregation,
Through assurance that our prayer is heard.
As we’re walking with Jehovah,
He will help us do what’s right.
He will help us to be loyal
And walk modestly in his sight.



(See also Gen. 5:24; 6:9; 1 Ki. 2:3, 4.)
