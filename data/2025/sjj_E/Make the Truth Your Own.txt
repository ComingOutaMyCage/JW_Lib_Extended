SONG 56
Make the Truth Your Own

(Proverbs 3:1, 2)

1. The way of the truth is the best way of living,
But no one can live your life for you.
So take the advice that Jehovah is giving;
Believe what he tells you is true.
(CHORUS)
Make the truth your own.
Make it live, yes, make it real.
And then feel the joy
Jehovah gives you
When you make the truth your own.


2. The effort you make and the time you are spending
In service to God and his Kingdom
Will yield rich results and a life that’s unending,
A life full of good things to come.
(CHORUS)
Make the truth your own.
Make it live, yes, make it real.
And then feel the joy
Jehovah gives you
When you make the truth your own.


3. Compared with our God, we are all little children
And need his direction and counsel.
So walk ev’ry day with our Father in heaven;
Receive his rich blessing in full.
(CHORUS)
Make the truth your own.
Make it live, yes, make it real.
And then feel the joy
Jehovah gives you
When you make the truth your own.
