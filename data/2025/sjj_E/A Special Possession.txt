SONG 25
A Special Possession

(1 Peter 2:9)

1. God has a new creation,
His spirit-anointed sons.
He has bought them from mankind;
His approval they’ve won.
(CHORUS)
A special possession,
They’re a people for your name.
They love you. They praise you.
As one they declare abroad your fame.


2. They are a holy nation,
Who handle the truth aright.
God has called them from darkness
To his wonderful light.
(CHORUS)
A special possession,
They’re a people for your name.
They love you. They praise you.
As one they declare abroad your fame.


3. Faithful to their commission,
They gather the other sheep.
To the Lamb they are loyal.
His commandments they keep.
(CHORUS)
A special possession,
They’re a people for your name.
They love you. They praise you.
As one they declare abroad your fame.
