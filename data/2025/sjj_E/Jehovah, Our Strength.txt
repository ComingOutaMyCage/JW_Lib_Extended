Jehovah, Our Strength

(Isaiah 12:2)

1. Gracious Jehovah, our strength and our might,
You are our Savior, in you we delight.
We are your Witnesses bearing your news,
Whether men hear or they proudly refuse.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, our Rock, Our strength and our might,
Your name we make known Both day and night.
Glorious Jehovah, Almighty in pow’r,
You are our hiding place; You are our Tow’r.


2. We who now serve you rejoice in your light;
Eyes that are opened now see truth and right.
Searching the Scriptures, we hear your command;
Making our choice, for your Kingdom we stand.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, our Rock, Our strength and our might,
Your name we make known Both day and night.
Glorious Jehovah, Almighty in pow’r,
You are our hiding place; You are our Tow’r.


3. Gladly, O God, we keep doing your will.
Though Satan mocks us, we’re trusting you still.
Though he may slay us, oh, help us to be
Firm to the end for your grand Sov’reignty.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah, our Rock, Our strength and our might,
Your name we make known Both day and night.
Glorious Jehovah, Almighty in pow’r,
You are our hiding place; You are our Tow’r.
