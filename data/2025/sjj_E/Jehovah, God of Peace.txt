SONG 112
Jehovah, God of Peace

(Philippians 4:9)

1. Jehovah, God of love,
You have promised us your peace.
So we ask you for your spirit;
May its fruitage yet increase.
Our faith in your dear Son,
Who is loyal, ever true,
Gives us access to your friendship;
We are now at peace with you.

2. Your spirit aids our sight
As your Word gives needed light.
We are guided and protected
In a world as dark as night.
Until the time has come
When all wars and terrors cease,
May your spirit bless our efforts
To maintain our godly peace.

3. You’ve gathered those you love,
Both in heaven and on earth,
We’re united by your spirit
To proclaim the Kingdom’s birth.
Your righteous Kingdom rule
Soon will bring an end to war.
Then the meek ones will delight to
Live in peace forevermore.
