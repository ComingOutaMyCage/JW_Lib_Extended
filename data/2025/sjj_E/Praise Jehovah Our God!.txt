Praise Jehovah Our God!

(Psalm 145:12)

1. Praise our God! Praise Jehovah God!
Make his glorious name known to all!
Sound alarm, For his day is near,
Help all people hear his warning call.
Jehovah decreed that now is the time
For his Firstborn to rule as King.
Reach out to all people, tell them the news,
Tell what blessings our God will bring!
(CHORUS)
Praise our God! Praise Jehovah God!
Make his greatness known in all the earth!


2. Praise our God! Sing it loud and clear!
With a joyful song, laud his name!
From the heart, From a grateful heart,
All his glory boldly we proclaim.
Though grand is our God and great are his works,
He is humble and good to all.
Our merciful Father knows what we need;
He responds when he hears our call.
(CHORUS)
Praise our God! Praise Jehovah God!
Make his greatness known in all the earth!
