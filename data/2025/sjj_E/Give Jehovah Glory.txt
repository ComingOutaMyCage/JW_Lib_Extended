SONG 159
Give Jehovah Glory

(Psalm 96:8)

1. Who is like you, O Jehovah,
High on your heavenly throne?
How could I ever repay you
For all of the love you have shown?
When I look up to the heavens,
Power and glory I see.
Who then am I, O Jehovah,
That you would show favor to me?
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, please hear the song I sing.
It’s a song of praise to you.
You are my God and the Eternal King,
So I give you what is due;
All the glory goes to you.


2. My life is yours, O Jehovah.
May all I do bring you praise.
Gladly I’ll speak of your goodness
And tell of your glorious ways.
Serving you, Great God, Jehovah,
Fills me with honor and pride.
You are my strength and my glory.
Forever may you be my Guide.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, please hear the song I sing.
It’s a song of praise to you.
You are my God and the Eternal King,
So I give you what is due;
All the glory goes to you.


3. Oceans and valleys below me,
Sun, moon, and stars up above
Fill me with joy and with wonder
And show me your unending love.
Majesty, wisdom, and beauty:
These are the things that I see.
How could I not give you glory
For making it all come to be?
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, please hear the song I sing.
It’s a song of praise to you.
You are my God and the Eternal King,
So I give you what is due;
All the glory goes to you.
