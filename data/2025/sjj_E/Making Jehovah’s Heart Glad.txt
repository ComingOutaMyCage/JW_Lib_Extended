Making Jehovah’s Heart Glad

(Proverbs 27:11)

1. Great God, we’ve vowed to do your will;
In wisdom your work we’ll fulfill,
For then we know we’ll have a part
In making glad your loving heart.

2. Your slave, your steward here on earth,
Declares your greatness and your worth
And feeds us nourishment when due,
To strengthen us your will to do.

3. Impart to us your active force,
That we may keep a faithful course
And bring forth fruitage to your praise.
May we make glad your heart each day.



(See also Matt. 24:45-47; Luke 11:13; 22:42.)
