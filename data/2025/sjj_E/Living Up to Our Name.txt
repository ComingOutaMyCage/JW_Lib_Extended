Living Up to Our Name

(Isaiah 43:10-12)

1. Glorious Jehovah, almighty, eternal,
Perfect in justice, in power, in love.
Source of all truth and of infinite wisdom,
You rule as Sov’reign in heaven above.
We as your people delight in your service;
Your Kingdom truth we delight to proclaim.
(CHORUS)
Being your Witnesses, great is our priv’lege.
Oh, may we ever live up to our name!


2. Working together in your sacred service
Binds us as brothers in love and in peace.
Teaching the truth and reflecting your glory
Fill us with joy as your praises increase.
Known by your name, O Jehovah, our Father,
We have the honor to add to your fame.
(CHORUS)
Being your Witnesses, great is our priv’lege.
Oh, may we ever live up to our name!




(See also Deut. 32:4; Ps. 43:3; Dan. 2:20, 21.)
