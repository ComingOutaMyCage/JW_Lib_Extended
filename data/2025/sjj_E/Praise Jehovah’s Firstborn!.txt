SONG 15
Praise Jehovah’s Firstborn!

(Hebrews 1:6)

1. Praise Jehovah’s Firstborn,
God’s duly appointed King.
He reigns for truth and justice;
Rich blessings his rule will bring.
With dignity and splendor
And love for God’s great name,
He’ll vindicate Jehovah,
His sov’reignty proclaim.
(CHORUS)
Praise Jehovah’s Firstborn!
All praise God’s anointed Son.
Installed upon Mount Zion,
His Kingship has now begun!


2. Praise Jehovah’s Firstborn,
Who died so that we may live.
He humbly paid the ransom;
Our sins God can now forgive.
The bride of Christ awaits him,
Adorned for him in white.
This marriage in the heavens
Will prove God’s rule is right.
(CHORUS)
Praise Jehovah’s Firstborn!
All praise God’s anointed Son.
Installed upon Mount Zion,
His Kingship has now begun!
