The Miracle of Life

(Psalm 36:9)

1. Ev’ry newborn child, Ev’ry drop of rain,
Ev’ry golden ray of sun, Each head of grain—
All are gifts from God; They reveal his way.
Miracles performed by him sustain us each day.
(CHORUS)
So, what are we to do with a gift so rare
But to love the One who gave it and show him we care.
No matter what we do, We never can earn it.
This gift is still a gift​—The miracle of life.


2. Others may give up, Lose their will to try,
Echoing the wife of Job: “Curse God and die.”
We are not that way; Praise to God we give,
Thanking him for ev’ry precious moment we live.
(CHORUS)
So, what are we to do with a gift so rare
But to love the ones around us and show them we care.
No matter what we do, We never can earn it.
This gift is still a gift​—The miracle of life.
