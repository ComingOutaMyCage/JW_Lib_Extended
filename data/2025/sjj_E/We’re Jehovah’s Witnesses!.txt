SONG 63
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses!

(Isaiah 43:10-12)

1. Men make gods of wood and stone,
But the true God they’ve not known.
He is God Almighty,
As he’s often shown.
Other gods just cannot see
What in future days will be.
For witnesses they look all in vain,
Since none their godship can maintain.
(CHORUS)
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.
We speak out in fearlessness.
Ours is the God of true prophecy;
What he foretells comes to be.


2. Proudly we declare God’s name,
Bearing witness to his fame.
News about his Kingdom,
Boldly we proclaim.
We help others come to see
How the truth can set them free.
As they grow strong, their voices they’ll raise,
Singing to God this song of praise.
(CHORUS)
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.
We speak out in fearlessness.
Ours is the God of true prophecy;
What he foretells comes to be.


3. Witnessing exalts God’s name,
Lifts therefrom reproach and shame.
And it warns the wicked,
Who God’s name defame.
Pardon it holds out to men,
If they turn to God again.
Whole-souled devotion brings joy and peace;
Promise of life that will not cease.
(CHORUS)
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.
We speak out in fearlessness.
Ours is the God of true prophecy;
What he foretells comes to be.
