Worship Jehovah During Youth

(Ecclesiastes 12:1)

1. Precious to God, we are daughters and sons,
Giving our strength as his faithful young ones.
Loving attention to us he will give,
Blessing our days for as long as we live.

2. Honoring parents who care for our lives
Helps us express what weâ€™re feeling inside.
Then we find favor with God and with men,
Drawing us close to Jehovah, our Friend.

3. May we remember our God in our youth,
Growing each day in our love of the truth.
Giving our best to our God, we will bring
Joy to the heart of Jehovah, our King.
