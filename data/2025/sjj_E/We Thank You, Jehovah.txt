SONG 46
We Thank You, Jehovah

(1 Thessalonians 5:18)

1. We thank you, Jehovah, each day and each night,
That you shed upon us your precious light.
We thank you that we have the priv’lege of prayer,
That we can approach you with ev’ry care.

2. We thank you, Jehovah, for your loving Son,
Who conquered the world; by his faith he won.
We thank you for guidance in doing your will.
You lovingly help us our vows fulfill.

3. We thank you, our God, for the honor to preach
About your great name and the truth to teach.
We thank you that soon all earth’s woes will be past,
While your Kingdom blessings forever last.
