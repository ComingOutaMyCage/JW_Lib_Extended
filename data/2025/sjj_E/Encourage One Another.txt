Encourage One Another

(Hebrews 10:24, 25)

1. As we encourage one another
To serve Jehovah faithfully,
We find the bonds of love are strengthened;
Fine works bring peace and unity.
The love we find among God’s people
Gives each the courage to endure.
Our congregation is a refuge,
A place where we can feel secure.

2. A word when spoken at the right time
Is, oh, how comforting to hear!
We hear these words of consolation
From friends so faithful and so dear.
How good it is to work together
With those whose hopes and goals we share!
We seek to strengthen one another
And help each one his burden bear.

3. As we with eyes of faith are seeing
The nearness of Jehovah’s day,
We need our gathering together
To keep us walking in the way.
United with Jehovah’s people,
We hope to serve eternally.
So we encourage one another
To hold to our integrity.
