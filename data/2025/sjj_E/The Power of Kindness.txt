SONG 116
The Power of Kindness

(Ephesians 4:32)

1. We praise you, Jehovah, deep from our hearts,
For in your Word we find
Your power supreme, your wisdom so great,
And yet you are loving and kind.

2. Your Son still invites those bruised by the world
To leave their cares behind.
How kindly his yoke, how tender his heart,
He’s always refreshing and kind.

3. We see in our God and Jesus our Lord,
The persons we should be.
The power of kindness we can possess.
With kindness, how strong we can be!



(See also Mic. 6:8; Matt. 11:28-30; Col. 3:12; 1 Pet. 2:3.)
