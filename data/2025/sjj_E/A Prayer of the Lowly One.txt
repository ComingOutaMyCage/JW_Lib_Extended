SONG 44
A Prayer of the Lowly One

(Psalm 4:1)

1. Jehovah God, I call to you and ask you:
“Hear my prayer.”
My wounds are deep and slow to heal;
my load is hard to bear.
Despondent thoughts and disappointed hopes
have left me weak.
O God of comfort, care for me;
your favor I do seek.
(CHORUS)
Do raise me up; help me endure.
When I’m in doubt, make my hope sure.
From deep despair, I turn to you.
Jehovah God, my strength renew.


2. Your Word has been my comfort and
a refuge when I’m weak,
Expressing feelings dear to me
in words I cannot speak.
Please build in me the faith and trust
that your Word does impart.
And help me always know your love
is greater than my heart.
(CHORUS)
Do raise me up; help me endure.
When I’m in doubt, make my hope sure.
From deep despair, I turn to you.
Jehovah God, my strength renew.
