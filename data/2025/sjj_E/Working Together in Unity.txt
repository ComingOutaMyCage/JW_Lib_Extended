SONG 101
Working Together in Unity

(Ephesians 4:3)

1. From a world divided and cold,
God has brought us into his fold.
Unity and peace we possess,
Bringing us happiness.
Unity we cherish;
Harmony is sweet.
In God’s work there’s much to be done.
He directs us now through his Son.
May we serve obediently,
Working in harmony.

2. As we pray to be of one mind,
Always tender, loving, and kind,
Love will grow and praise will increase,
Giving us joy and peace.
Peace is so refreshing,
Bringing such delight.
As we show true brotherly love,
God will grant us peace from above.
With his help, united we’ll be,
Serving him endlessly.
