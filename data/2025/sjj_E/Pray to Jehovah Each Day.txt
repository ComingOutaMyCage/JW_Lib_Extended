Pray to Jehovah Each Day

(1 Thessalonians 5:17)

1. Pray to Jehovah, the Hearer of prayer.
This is our priv’lege, for his name we bear.
Open your heart as you would to a friend,
Trust that on Him you can always depend.
Pray to Jehovah each day.

2. Pray to Jehovah, give thanks that we live,
Asking forgiveness as we do forgive.
May we confess to our God whom we trust.
He is our Maker and knows we are dust.
Pray to Jehovah each day.

3. Pray to Jehovah when troubles appear.
He is our Father and ever so near.
Seek his protection, and look for his aid;
He is our confidence; don’t be afraid.
Pray to Jehovah each day.
