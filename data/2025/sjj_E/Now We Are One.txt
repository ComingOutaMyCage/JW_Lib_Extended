SONG 132
Now We Are One

(Genesis 2:23, 24)

1. This is at last bone of my bone,
Flesh of my flesh; now I’m not alone.
God has provided a partner,
Someone to call my own.
Now we are one; now there can be
Blessings to share for you and for me.
As man and woman together,
We are a family.
Ev’ry day we’ll serve our God above.
As he shows the way,
Unfailing love we’ll display.
As we have vowed, so may it be.
Seasons of joy, may we come to see.
Oh, may we honor Jehovah,
And may you always be my love.



(See also Gen. 29:18; Eccl. 4:9, 10; 1 Cor. 13:8.)
