The Meditation of My Heart

(Psalm 19:14)

1. The meditation of my heart,
The thoughts I ponder through the day—
May they be pleasing to you, Lord,
And keep me steadfast in your way.
When worries weigh upon my mind
And make me restless in the night,
Then may I meditate on you
And things I know to be upright.

2. Whatever things are chaste and true,
Whatever virtue there may be,
Whatever things well-spoken-of—
May thoughts of these bring peace to me.
How precious are your thoughts, O God!
Beyond all counting is their sum.
So may I ponder your own words,
Absorbed in them may I become.



(See also Ps. 49:3; 63:6; 139:17, 23; Phil. 4:7, 8; 1 Tim. 4:15.)
