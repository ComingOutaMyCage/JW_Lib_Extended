SONG 161
To Do Your Will Is My Delight

(Psalm 40:8)

1. As your Son rose up from the Jordan
And your precious words filled his heart,
He was deeply moved by your purpose,
And he longed to play his part.
He refused to yield to temptation.
He was zealous for your name.
He gave ev’rything he could give you,
And I long to do the same.
(CHORUS)
To do your will is my delight.
I give you all my strength and might.
This joy I feel; this joy is real.
I will walk on in your light.
To do your will is my delight.
I have a hope so clear and bright.
Your love I feel; your love is real.
I will praise you day and night.
It’s my delight.


2. As I’ve come to know you, Jehovah,
I’ve found happiness deep inside.
I will gladly speak as your witness,
And your truth I will not hide.
Serving side by side with my brothers,
There’s no better way to live.
I will bear your name, oh, so proudly.
I’ll give all that I can give.
(CHORUS)
To do your will is my delight.
I give you all my strength and might.
This joy I feel; this joy is real.
I will walk on in your light.
To do your will is my delight.
I have a hope so clear and bright.
Your love I feel; your love is real.
I will praise you day and night.
It’s my delight.
Your will is my delight.
