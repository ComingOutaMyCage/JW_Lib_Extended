“Let Your Light Shine”

(Matthew 5:16)

1. Jesus has commanded
That we shine our light,
Like the sun, impartial,
Comforting and bright.
Through the Holy Scriptures,
Thoughts of peace are heard.
May we now reflect his light
As we teach God’s Word.

2. Let God’s Kingdom message
Speak to ev’ry heart;
Let it shine before us
As we play our part.
Light from Scripture guides us
As we bring good news.
Sharing truth with ev’ryone;
Truth is theirs to choose.

3. Light from acts of kindness
Brightens up this world,
To our words adds beauty
Like a priceless pearl.
May our light keep shining
As we do what’s right,
Then our works will always be
Pleasing in God’s sight.
