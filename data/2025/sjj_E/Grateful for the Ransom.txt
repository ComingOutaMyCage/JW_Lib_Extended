SONG 18
Grateful for the Ransom

(Luke 22:20)

1. Today, Jehovah God,
we stand before your throne,
For you showed the greatest love
that could ever be shown.
You gave the gift of your dear Son,
that we might live.
No greater sacrifice than this
could you ever give.
(CHORUS)
He gave his life to set us free.
His precious blood provides the key.
With all our hearts,
we’ll go on thanking you eternally.


2. It was a willing sacrifice
that Jesus made.
Out of love, his perfect life
was the price that he paid.
We had no hope until he came
to save mankind.
But now our hope is finding life,
leaving death behind.
(CHORUS)
He gave his life to set us free.
His precious blood provides the key.
With all our hearts,
we’ll go on thanking you eternally.
