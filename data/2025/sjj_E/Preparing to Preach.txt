SONG 53
Preparing to Preach

(Jeremiah 1:17)

1. Morning comes.
Soon we will be
On our way to preach good news.
But it’s dark outside,
And the rain starts to fall.
It would be easy to stay inside,
sleepy-eyed.
(CHORUS)
Positive thoughts and preparation,
Praying that we’ll succeed;
This can provide the inspiration,
We’ll surely need.
We’re not alone; the angels guide us.
Jesus commands them all.
And with a loyal friend beside us,
We’ll never fall.


2. Soon we’ll see
Joy come our way
If these things we keep in mind.
And Jehovah sees
Ev’ry effort we make,
And he remembers the love we show;
this we know.
(CHORUS)
Positive thoughts and preparation,
Praying that we’ll succeed;
This can provide the inspiration,
We’ll surely need.
We’re not alone; the angels guide us.
Jesus commands them all.
And with a loyal friend beside us,
We’ll never fall.
