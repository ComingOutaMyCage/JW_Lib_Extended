SONG 74
Join in the Kingdom Song!

(Psalm 98:1)

1. This is a song, a happy song of vict’ry;
It magnifies the One who is supreme.
The words give hope and prompt all to be loyal.
Come sing with us; enjoy its Kingdom theme:
(CHORUS)
‘Come worship God Before his throne.
His Son is King; Let’s make it known!
Come learn this song, this song about the Kingdom;
Bow down to God, and praise his holy name.’


2. With this new song, we advertise the Kingdom.
Christ Jesus rules; the earth is his domain.
And as foretold, there is a newborn nation:
The Kingdom heirs, who welcome Jesus’ reign:
(CHORUS)
‘Come worship God Before his throne.
His Son is King; Let’s make it known!
Come learn this song, this song about the Kingdom;
Bow down to God, and praise his holy name.’


3. This Kingdom song, all humble ones can master.
The words are clear, their message warm and bright.
In all the earth, a multitude have learned it,
And they in turn still others now invite:
(CHORUS)
‘Come worship God Before his throne.
His Son is King; Let’s make it known!
Come learn this song, this song about the Kingdom;
Bow down to God, and praise his holy name.’
