SONG 123
Loyally Submitting to Theocratic Order

(1 Corinthians 14:33)

1. As Jehovah’s people sound throughout the earth
Truths about the Kingdom and its priceless worth,
Theocratic order they must all obey
And remain united, loyalty display.
(CHORUS)
Loyal submission in recognition,
This to our God we owe.
He gives protection, tender affection,
Loyalty to him we show.


2. God provides his steward and his active force.
These will ever guide us in our Christian course.
So may we be steadfast, seeking God to please,
Loyally proclaiming all his wise decrees!
(CHORUS)
Loyal submission in recognition,
This to our God we owe.
He gives protection, tender affection,
Loyalty to him we show.




(See also Luke 12:42; Heb. 13:7, 17.)
