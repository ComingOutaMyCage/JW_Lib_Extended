SONG 91
Our Labor of Love

(Psalm 127:1)

1. Jehovah, this is the day;
Now from our hearts, we want to pray.
How you have honored us, favored us,
More than words can say!
Upon our labor of love,
We’ve seen your blessing from above.
And now a building stands, by our hands,
As the proof thereof.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, it was a priv’lege
For us to build this place for you.
May we continue in your service throughout our days
And bring you praise in all we do.


2. What happy faces we see,
And what good friends we’ve come to be!
And how we’ll cherish these memories
For eternity!
We saw your spirit, O Lord,
In how we worked with one accord.
And how we’ve added fame to your name;
What a grand reward!
(CHORUS)
Jehovah God, it was a priv’lege
For us to build this place for you.
May we continue in your service throughout our days
And bring you praise in all we do.
