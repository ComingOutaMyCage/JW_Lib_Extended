SONG 16
Praise Jah for His Son, the Anointed

(Revelation 21:2)

1. Jehovah anointed his Son
To rule over ev’ryone.
His throne is established on justice,
That God’s will on earth may be done.
(CHORUS)
Praise Jah for his Son, the Anointed.
Praise Jesus, O you faithful sheep,
Who loyally follow day after day
and all his commandments keep.
Praise Jah for his Son, the Anointed,
the Ruler of heavenly fame,
Anointed with exultation and might
to honor God’s holy name.


2. Christ’s brothers are chosen and called.
God gives them their own new birth.
This bride class will share in the Kingdom
And bring Paradise to this earth.
(CHORUS)
Praise Jah for his Son, the Anointed.
Praise Jesus, O you faithful sheep,
Who loyally follow day after day
and all his commandments keep.
Praise Jah for his Son, the Anointed,
the Ruler of heavenly fame,
Anointed with exultation and might
to honor God’s holy name.
