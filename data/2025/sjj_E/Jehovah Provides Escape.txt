SONG 148
Jehovah Provides Escape

(2 Samuel 22:1-8)

1. The living God, Jehovah, you have proved to be;
Your mighty works abound
in earth and sky and sea.
No rival god can equal what you have done
​—there is none.
Our foes will be consumed.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah provides escape for the loyal.
His servants will see what a mighty Crag is he.
So with courage and faith in our God,
we spread the fame
Of Jehovah, our Source of escape,
and praise his name.


2. Though ropes of death encircle me, I call to you,
“Jehovah, give me strength,
and give me courage too.”
From your own temple dwelling, you hear my plea,
“Shelter me;
Rescue me, O my God.”
(CHORUS)
Jehovah provides escape for the loyal.
His servants will see what a mighty Crag is he.
So with courage and faith in our God,
we spread the fame
Of Jehovah, our Source of escape,
and praise his name.


3. From heaven you will thunder
and give forth your voice.
Your enemies will quake;
your servants will rejoice.
You prove to be whatever you need to be;
all will see
How you provide escape.
(CHORUS)
Jehovah provides escape for the loyal.
His servants will see what a mighty Crag is he.
So with courage and faith in our God,
we spread the fame
Of Jehovah, our Source of escape,
and praise his name.
