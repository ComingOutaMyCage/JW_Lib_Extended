Making Known the Kingdom Truth

(Acts 20:20, 21)

1. There was a time we did not know
The way a Christian ought to go.
Then Jehovah sent the light,
His Kingdom truth so clear and bright.
Our Father’s will we then could see
To serve the grand Theocracy,
To declare Jehovah’s fame,
And help to glorify his holy name.
We witness now to all we meet,
From door to door and on the street.
We take the time to help them see;
We teach the truth that sets us free.
And as we strive in ev’ry land
Jehovah’s worship to expand,
May we serve our God as one
Until Jehovah says the work is done.



(See also Josh. 9:9; Isa. 24:15; John 8:12, 32.)
