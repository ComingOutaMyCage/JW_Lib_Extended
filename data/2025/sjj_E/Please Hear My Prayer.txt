SONG 41
Please Hear My Prayer

(Psalm 54)

1. Heavenly Father, please hear my song.
You are my God; to you I belong.
Great is your name, beyond all compare.
(CHORUS)
Gracious Jehovah, please hear my prayer.


2. Thank you, O God, for granting this day,
Giving me life, and showing the way.
How I delight in your tender care.
(CHORUS)
Gracious Jehovah, please hear my prayer.


3. Oh, how I long to do what is right!
Help me, O Lord, to walk in the light.
Give me the strength all burdens to bear.
(CHORUS)
Gracious Jehovah, please hear my prayer.
