<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[50]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Take Jehovah at his word.</em></strong> He inspired Bible writers to describe him as he truly is. Consider the tender way in which the psalmist David described Jehovah. “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are discouraged.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:18-19:34:18" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 34:18</a>, ftn.) When you are downhearted, you may feel that you are all alone. But Jehovah promises that at such times, he is close to you because he sees that you need him more than ever. In another psalm, David wrote: “Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:56:8-19:56:8" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 56:8</a>) Jehovah sees when you struggle. He cares deeply about you and what you are going through. He, in a sense, collects your tears and treasures them, as though they were the precious water in a traveler’s skin bottle. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:3-19:139:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 139:3</a>, we read: “You [Jehovah] are familiar with all my ways.” Jehovah sees <strong><em>all</em></strong> your ways, but he focuses on the <strong><em>good</em></strong> you do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) Why?

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> By means of such comforting scriptures in his inspired Word, Jehovah is, in effect, saying: “I want you to know how much I love you and care about you.” But as we learned earlier, Satan promotes the lie that Jehovah does not love you.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:1:5-16:1:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Neh. 1:5</a>) So if at times you need reassurance that Jehovah loves you, stop and ask yourself, ‘Do I love Jehovah?’ Then think about this: If you love him and are trying your best to please him, you have his assurance that he loves you dearly.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[64]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> By describing Jehovah as our Father, Jesus is, in a sense, telling us: “Jehovah is not just <strong><em>my</em></strong> Father; he is <strong><em>your</em></strong> Father too. And I assure you that he loves you and deeply cares about you as an individual.” So if at times you feel unsure about Jehovah’s love for you, stop and ask yourself, ‘Shouldn’t I trust the words of the Son who knows our Father best and who always speaks the truth?’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:22-60:2:22" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:22</a>.</p>

Ponder how inspired Bible writers described his tender love. Reflect on the way that he responds to love; he would never receive it and then fail to show it in return. Meditate on why you can view the ransom as a personal gift to you. And trust Jesus’ assurance that Jehovah is <strong><em>your</em></strong> heavenly Father. Then if anyone should ask: “Are you sure that Jehovah loves you?” you will confidently respond: “Yes, he does! And I do my best every day to show my love for him!”</p>
