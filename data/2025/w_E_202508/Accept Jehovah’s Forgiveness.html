The Hebrew word rendered “pardon” can mean “lift up,” “take away,” or “carry.” When forgiving David, Jehovah, in a sense, lifted up his sins and carried them away.

The next part of the verse explains: “You abound in loyal love for all those who call on you.” As we learned in the preceding article, loyal love impels Jehovah to form a deep, lasting attachment to his faithful worshippers. Moved by his loyal love, he “will freely forgive” all repentant sinners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:7-23:55:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 55:7</a>, ftn.) If you find it hard to accept God’s forgiveness, you might ask yourself: ‘Do I believe that Jehovah is a Forgiver​—that he readily forgives <strong><em>all</em></strong> repentant ones who call out to him for mercy?

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> David says that Jehovah “well knows how we are formed.” He formed Adam “out of dust from the ground” and well knows that perfect humans have natural limitations​—for example, the need to eat, sleep, and breathe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:7-1:2:7" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>) But when Adam and Eve sinned, being dust took on added meaning. As their offspring, we inherited a sinful nature that makes us prone to doing wrong things. Jehovah is not just <strong><em>aware</em></strong> of our sinful nature; David speaks of him as <strong><em>“remembering”</em></strong> it. The Hebrew word used here can mean to take positive action. We might sum up the meaning of David’s words this way: Jehovah understands that we will fall short at times; when we do, he is moved <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>to respond to our heartfelt repentance by showing us mercy and forgiveness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:38-19:78:39" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 78:38, 39</a>.</p>

What does this tell us about the sins that Jehovah forgives? One reference work illustrates it this way: “If sin be removed so far, then we may be sure that the scent, the trace, the very memory of it must be entirely gone.” Just think​—a scent can trigger a memory. But when Jehovah forgives, it is as if not even a trace of a scent remains that would call to mind the sin and cause him to hold it against us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:21-26:18:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Acts 3:19</a>.</p>

His example shows that our life can turn out well even if we have made serious mistakes.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69">David committed grave sins, including adultery and murder. But because he was sincerely repentant, Jehovah forgave him. David accepted reproof, corrected his way, and thereafter never swerved from pure worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:11:1-10:11:27" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Sam. 11:1-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:13-10:12:13" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 12:13</a>.</p>

Similarly, it can be helpful if we occasionally look back at our past mistakes; we can learn from them and strengthen our resolve not to repeat them. But if we keep focusing on past mistakes, the guilt we carry may limit what we can do now in serving God. Instead, may we keep focused on the road ahead of us. We are on the road that leads to life in God’s promised new world, where bad memories “will not be called to mind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isa. 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:25-20:4:25" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Prov. 4:25</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:19" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 John 3:19</a>, ftn.) Why? Because Satan will not let up in his efforts to convince us that we are unlovable or unforgivable. Either way, his goal is the same​—to get us to stop serving Jehovah. We can expect that Satan will intensify his efforts because he knows that his time is short.

To convince your heart of Jehovah’s forgiveness, reflect on how Jehovah has described himself. Meditate on what he inspired Bible writers to say about his forgiveness. Do not forget that he is well-aware of your sinful nature and will deal with you mercifully. And remember that when he forgives, he does so completely. Then with the same type of confidence that David had in Jehovah’s mercy, you will be able to say, “Thank you, Jehovah, for pardoning ‘the error of my sins’!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:5-19:32:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 32:5</a>.</p>
