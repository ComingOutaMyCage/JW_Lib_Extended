SONG 121 We Need Self-Control

How to Win the Fight Against Wrong Desires


“Do not let sin continue to rule as king in your mortal bodies so that you should obey their desires.”​—ROM. 6:12.


FOCUS
To help us to (1) fight discouragement and (2) avoid giving in to temptation.


 1. What is true of all imperfect humans?

Your answer


HAVE you ever had a strong desire to do something that Jehovah disapproves? If so, do not conclude that you face a greater trial than everyone else. The Bible says: “No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.” (1 Cor. 10:13)a This means that whatever wrong desire you struggle with, others are dealing with it too. You are not alone, and with Jehovah’s help, you can win the fight.
 2. What kinds of temptations might some Christians and Bible students struggle with? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


2 The Bible also says: “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire.” (Jas. 1:14) What entices one person may differ from what entices another. For example, some Christians might be tempted to engage in immoral behavior with someone of the opposite sex; others, with someone of the same sex. Those who have quit viewing pornography might feel a strong urge to return to the habit. Many who have stopped abusing drugs or alcohol face a similar challenge. Those are a few desires that some Christians and Bible students struggle with. At some point, all of us have likely felt the way the apostle Paul did, who wrote: “When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.”​—Rom. 7:21.




Temptation may arise unexpectedly​—anytime and anywhere (See paragraph 2)d




 3. What effect can a persistent wrong desire have on an individual?

Your answer


3 If you are dealing with a persistent wrong desire, you might feel powerless, as if you were unable to resist giving in to temptation. You might also feel hopeless, as if Jehovah would condemn you simply for having the wrong desire. Be assured that neither assumption is true! To explain why, this article will address two questions: (1) Where do feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness come from? (2) How can you win the fight against wrong desires?
HOW “THE WICKED ONE” WANTS US TO FEEL
 4. (a) Why does Satan want us to feel powerless? (b) Why are we not powerless in our fight against temptation?

Your answers


4 Satan wants us to feel powerless when we are tempted. Jesus acknowledged this when he taught his followers to pray: “Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.” (Matt. 6:13) Satan questions man’s willingness to obey Jehovah when faced with temptation. (Job 2:4, 5) Think about the irony of that. Satan is the one who was enticed by his own desire, and he was not willing to remain faithful to Jehovah. Evidently, he believes that we are just like him, that we will readily abandon Jehovah when we are tempted. Satan even thought that the perfect Son of God could be swayed by temptation! (Matt. 4:8, 9) But think: Are we really powerless in our fight against wrong desires? Not at all! We agree with the apostle Paul, who wrote: “For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.”​—Phil. 4:13.
 5. How do we know that Jehovah is confident that we can win the fight against wrong desires?

Your answer


5 In stark contrast to Satan, Jehovah is confident that we can resist wrong desires. How do we know that? Because Jehovah foretold that a great crowd of integrity-keepers would survive the great tribulation. Think about what that means. Jehovah, who cannot lie, says that a large number​—not just a few—​will enter his new world with a clean standing, having “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:9, 13, 14) Clearly, Jehovah does not view us as powerless in our fight against wrong desires.
6-7. Why does Satan want us to feel hopeless in our fight against temptation?

Your answer


6 Satan would like us to feel not only powerless but also hopeless​—as if Jehovah would condemn us simply for having wrong desires. Again, think of the irony. Satan is the one who is hopeless, judged by Jehovah as unworthy of eternal life. (Gen. 3:15; Rev. 20:10) Satan no doubt wants us to feel hopeless too​—especially since we have the prospect of attaining the very blessing that he has been denied. However, we are not hopeless. In fact, the Bible assures us that Jehovah wants to help us, not condemn us. He “does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.”​—2 Pet. 3:9.
7 Really, then, if we believe that we are either powerless or hopeless in our fight against wrong desires, we are thinking the way Satan would like us to think. Realizing that can help us strengthen our resolve to take a firm stand against him.​—1 Pet. 5:8, 9.
HOW OUR SINFUL CONDITION CAN MAKE US FEEL
 8. Besides wrong acts, what does sin involve? (Psalm 51:5) (See also “Expression Explained.”)

Your answer


8 Besides Satan, there is another factor that can cause us to feel powerless and hopeless in our fight against wrong desires. What is it? Our sinful condition, which we inherited from our first human parents.b​—Job 14:4; read Psalm 51:5.
9-10. (a) How did the condition of sin affect Adam and Eve? (See also picture.) (b) How does the condition of sin affect us?

Your answers


9 Consider how the condition of sin affected Adam and Eve. After disobeying Jehovah, they hid themselves and tried to cover their bodies. Commenting on that act, Insight on the Scriptures says: “Sin thus caused them to feel guilt, anxiety, insecurity, shame.” It was as if Adam and Eve were locked inside a house that had only those four rooms. Adam and Eve could move from one room to another, but they could not get out of the house. They could not escape their sinful condition.
10 Of course, we are not in the exact same circumstance as Adam and Eve were in. The ransom​—which does not apply to the first couple—​can cleanse us of sin and give us a clean conscience. (1 Cor. 6:11) Still, we inherited a sinful condition. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that we too feel guilt, anxiety, insecurity, and shame. In fact, the Bible says that sin continues to hold mankind in its grip. And it has done so “even over those who [have] not sinned in the same way that Adam transgressed.” (Rom. 5:14) As discouraging as that fact might seem, it need not make us feel powerless and hopeless. We can reject those negative feelings. How?




Sin caused Adam and Eve to feel guilt, anxiety, insecurity, and shame (See paragraph 9)




11. How should we react to feelings of powerlessness, and why? (Romans 6:12)

Your answer


11 When we feel powerless​—as if we could not successfully fight wrong desires—​we can view that as our sinful condition “talking,” and we should not listen to it. Why? Because the Bible teaches that we do not have to let sin continue to “rule as king” over us. (Read Romans 6:12.) This means that we can choose not to act on wrong desires. (Gal. 5:16) Jehovah is confident that we can resist temptation; otherwise, he would not require us to do so. (Deut. 30:11-14; Rom. 6:6; 1 Thess. 4:3) Clearly, we are not powerless in our fight against wrong desires.
12. How should we react to feelings of hopelessness, and why?

Your answer


12 Similarly, when we feel hopeless​—as if Jehovah would condemn us simply for having wrong desires—​we can view that as our sinful condition “talking,” and we should not listen to it. Why? Because the Bible teaches that Jehovah understands our sinful condition. (Ps. 103:13, 14) He “knows all things” about us, including the different ways that our inherited sinful condition has contributed to our wrong inclinations. (1 John 3:19, 20) As long as we do not give in to sinful inclinations by carrying out wrong desires, we can have a clean standing with Jehovah. Why can we be certain of that?
13-14. Does simply having wrong desires mean that we have failed? Explain.

Your answer


13 The Bible distinguishes between the practice of what is wrong (which we can control) and the desire for what is wrong (which may arise involuntarily). For example, some among the first-century Christians in Corinth formerly practiced homosexuality. Paul wrote: “That is what some of you were.” Did this mean that they never again had any desire to commit homosexual acts? It would not be realistic to believe so, since such cravings are often deeply ingrained. But Christians who exercised self-control and avoided acting on their desires were acceptable to Jehovah. He considered them “washed clean.” (1 Cor. 6:9-11) The same can be true of you.
14 No matter what wrong desires you struggle with, you can succeed in overcoming them. Even if you cannot eliminate them, you can exercise self-control and keep from “carrying out the will of the flesh and of [your] thoughts.” (Eph. 2:3) How can you do that and thereby win the fight against wrong desires?
HOW TO WIN
15. If we are to win the fight against wrong desires, why do we need to be honest with ourselves?

Your answer


15 To win the fight against wrong desires, you will need to be honest with yourself about your weaknesses. Be careful not to deceive yourself with “false reasoning.” (Jas. 1:22) Minimizing the problem​—such as by reasoning, ‘Others drink more than I do,’ or by blaming others for it, ‘I wouldn’t be tempted to look at pornography if my wife were more affectionate’—​will only make it easier for you to give in to temptation. So do not try to justify a wrong course, even in your thinking. Take responsibility for your actions.​—Gal. 6:7.
16. How can you strengthen your resolve to do what is right?

Your answer


16 Besides being honest with yourself about your weaknesses, you will need to strengthen your resolve not to give in to them. (1 Cor. 9:26, 27; 1 Thess. 4:4; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16) Take note of what makes you most vulnerable and when. It might be a certain type of temptation or a certain time of day when you are more likely to be tempted. For example, are you more vulnerable when you are tired or when it is late at night? Anticipate the temptation, and mentally rehearse how you will respond to it. The best time to do this is before the temptation occurs.​—Prov. 22:3.
17. What can we learn from Joseph’s example? (Genesis 39:7-9) (See also pictures.)

Your answer


17 Consider how Joseph responded when Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce him. His refusal of her advances was immediate and decisive. (Read Genesis 39:7-9.) What does that indicate? Joseph knew exactly how he felt about taking another man’s wife before Potiphar’s wife tried to seduce him. In the same way, you can strengthen your resolve to do what is right before a tempting situation presents itself. That way, when you are tempted, it will be easier for you to follow through on the decision that you have already made.




Reject temptation immediately, as Joseph did! (See paragraph 17)




“KEEP TESTING”
18. How can you win the fight against wrong desires? (2 Corinthians 13:5)

Your answer


18 To win the fight against wrong desires, you will need to “keep testing” yourself​—that is, keep examining yourself regularly to see how you are doing. (Read 2 Corinthians 13:5.) From time to time, review your thinking and actions and make adjustments where needed. For example, even when you succeed in rejecting temptation, you can ask yourself: ‘How long did it take me to say no?’ If you realize that you delayed, do not condemn yourself. Instead, take steps to shore up your defenses. Ask yourself such questions as: ‘Can I reduce the amount of time it takes me to dismiss improper thoughts? Is my choice of entertainment making it more difficult for me to resist temptation? Do I immediately turn my eyes away from immoral scenes? Do I understand why Jehovah’s standards are always for the best even when they require that I exercise self-control?’​—Ps. 101:3.
19. How can seemingly small unwise decisions make it more difficult for us to fight wrong desires?

Your answer


19 You should also avoid rationalizing. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.” (Jer. 17:9) Jesus said that it produces “wicked reasonings.” (Matt. 15:19) For example, a person who has stopped viewing pornography may, after a time, think that it is “safe” to look at sexually arousing photos because they do not contain outright nudity. Or he might reason, ‘There is nothing wrong with fantasizing about improper desires as long as I don’t carry them out.’ In a sense, that person’s treacherous heart is “planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.” (Rom. 13:14) How can you avoid doing that? Be aware of and avoid making small unwise decisions that will lead you to making big unwise decisions, such as giving in to wrongdoing.c Reject also any thoughts, or “wicked reasonings,” that tend to excuse wrong behavior.
20. What prospect do we have for the future, and what help do we have right now?

Your answer


20 As we have learned, by means of Jehovah’s help, we have the power to resist temptation. Also, thanks to his mercy, we have the hope of everlasting life in the new world. What a relief it will be to serve Jehovah with a pure mind and heart! Until that time, we can be certain that we are neither powerless nor hopeless in our fight against wrong desires. With Jehovah’s blessing on our efforts, we can win!

SONG 122 Be Steadfast, Immovable!

a The International Standard Version renders that verse: “No temptation has overtaken you that is unusual for human beings.”
b EXPRESSION EXPLAINED: In the Bible, the word “sin” often refers to an act, such as stealing, adultery, or murder. (Ex. 20:13-15; 1 Cor. 6:18) In some scriptures, though, “sin” refers to a condition that we inherited at birth, even though we had not yet committed any act of sin.
c Note that the young man depicted at Proverbs 7:7-23 made small unwise decisions before making the big unwise decision of giving in to sexual immorality.

d PICTURE DESCRIPTION: Left: While sitting in a coffee shop, a young brother notices two men exchanging displays of affection. Right: A sister notices two people smoking.
