The ability to endure as Christians does not come from our own strength; rather, it comes from Jehovah, the one who can give us “power beyond what is normal.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:7</a>) In this article, we will discuss four provisions that Jehovah has made available to help us endure.

Yes! Doing so is in harmony with his will. Why can we say that? When we endure trials, we provide Jehovah with a reply to his taunter, Satan the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>) Besides that, the Bible says that Jehovah is eager “to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) So we can be sure that Jehovah has both the power and the desire to help us endure.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:18-23:30:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 30:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 41:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Luke 11:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[49]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The Bible says that when we pray earnestly about our concerns, “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard [our] hearts and [our] mental powers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:7-50:4:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Phil. 4:7</a>) Consider what that means. People who do not serve Jehovah face hardships, and they may try various methods to achieve peace of mind. For example, some use a form of meditation to empty the mind of all thoughts, including anxious ones. Emptying the mind is spiritually dangerous. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:43-40:12:45" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 12:43-45</a>.) Besides, the peace that Jehovah provides when we pray is far superior to any form of peace someone might achieve through such meditation. When we pray to Jehovah, we demonstrate that we fully lean on him and he gives us “continuous <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>peace.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:3-23:26:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 26:3</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> One way Jehovah does that is by helping us call to mind the reassuring truths we have learned from his Word.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rom. 15:13</a>) Recall how hope helped Jesus to endure the most difficult day of his earthly life. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="35-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 12:2</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jesus knew that his faithfulness would contribute to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus also looked forward to rejoining his Father and in time serving with his brothers in the heavenly Kingdom. Similarly, our hope of living forever in God’s new world helps us to endure any hardship that Satan’s world inflicts on us.</p>

When this happened, Alla said: “Praying about our future hope and meditating on it keeps me from getting too discouraged. I understand <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>that this is not the end. Jehovah will be victorious, and so will we.”</p>

Imagine what it must be like for them to deal with the hardships of Satan’s world <strong><em>without</em></strong> knowing God’s purpose for the future. You may stir their interest in our Kingdom hope even with a brief discussion.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[75]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> After successfully enduring many trials, Job told Jehovah: “Now I know that you are able to do all things and that nothing you have in mind to do is impossible for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:2-18:42:2" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Job 42:2</a>) As Job learned, nothing can interfere with the fulfillment of Jehovah’s purpose. That fact can strengthen us as we endure. To illustrate, imagine a sick woman who is discouraged because numerous doctors have been unable to cure her. But when an experienced and trusted doctor identifies the problem and explains how he will treat her illness, she feels relief, even though it will take some time for her to be healed. She can now endure, knowing that she has a bright hope​—the hope that she <strong><em>will</em></strong> get better. In a similar way, our confidence in our hope of the Paradise to come helps us to endure.</p>
