Benefit From Marginal References


Marginal references in the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures show the internal harmony of the Bible by connecting you to scriptures containing additional details. Marginal references are indicated by a small character following a word. In printed Bibles, look for the matching character in the center or side column to find related scriptures. On jw.org or in the JW Library® app, tap on the character to view the reference scriptures.
Marginal references may link you to any of the following and more:
Parallel Account: The reference identifies another occurrence of the same event. For example, see 2 Samuel 24:1 and 1 Chronicles 21:1.
Quotation: The reference shows where a phrase or an expression originated. For example, see Matthew 4:4 and Deuteronomy 8:3.
Fulfilled prophecy: The reference links a prophecy with its fulfillment. For example, see Matthew 21:5 and Zechariah 9:9.
