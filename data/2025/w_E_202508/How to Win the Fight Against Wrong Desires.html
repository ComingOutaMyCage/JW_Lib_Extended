If so, do not conclude that you face a greater trial than everyone else. The Bible says: “No temptation has come upon you except what is common to men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:13-46:10:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>)<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> This means that whatever wrong desire you struggle with, others are dealing with it too.

For example, some Christians might be tempted to engage in immoral behavior with someone of the opposite sex; others, with someone of the same sex. Those who have quit viewing pornography might feel a strong urge to return to the habit. Many who have stopped abusing drugs or alcohol face a similar challenge. Those are a few desires that some Christians and Bible students struggle with. At some point, all of us have likely felt the way the apostle Paul did, who wrote: “When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21</a>.</p>

Jesus acknowledged this when he taught his followers to pray: “Do not bring us into temptation, <strong><em>but deliver us from the wicked one</em></strong><em>.”</em> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:13-40:6:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 6:13</a>) Satan questions man’s willingness to obey Jehovah when faced with temptation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:4-18:2:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) Think about the irony of that. Satan is the one who was enticed by his own desire, and he was not willing to remain faithful to Jehovah. Evidently, he believes that we are just like him, that we will readily abandon Jehovah when we are tempted. Satan even thought that the perfect Son of God could be swayed by temptation! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8, 9</a>) But think: Are we really powerless in our fight against wrong desires? Not at all!

How do we know that? Because Jehovah foretold that a great crowd of integrity-keepers would survive the great tribulation. Think about what that means. Jehovah, who cannot lie, says that a large number​—not just a few—​will enter his new world with a clean standing, having “washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:13-66:7:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) Clearly, Jehovah does not view us as powerless in our fight against wrong desires.</p>

After disobeying Jehovah, they hid themselves and tried to cover their bodies. Commenting on that act, <em>Insight on the Scriptures</em> says: “Sin thus caused them to feel guilt, anxiety, insecurity, shame.” It was as if Adam and Eve were locked inside a house that had only those four rooms. Adam and Eve could move from one room to another, but they could not get out of the house. They could not escape their sinful condition.</p>

Paul wrote: “That is what some of you <strong><em>were</em></strong><em>.”</em> Did this mean that they never again had any desire to commit homosexual acts?

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[72]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> To win the fight against wrong desires, you will need to “keep testing” yourself​—that is, keep examining yourself regularly to see how you are doing. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:13:5-47:13:5" data-bid="29-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 13:5</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> From time to time, review your thinking and actions and make adjustments where needed. For example, even when you succeed in rejecting temptation, you can ask yourself: ‘How long did it take me to say no?’ If you realize that you delayed, do not condemn yourself. Instead, take steps to shore up your defenses. Ask yourself such questions as: ‘Can I reduce the amount of time it takes me to dismiss <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>improper thoughts? Is my choice of entertainment making it more difficult for me to resist temptation? Do I immediately turn my eyes away from immoral scenes? Do I understand why Jehovah’s standards are always for the best even when they require that I exercise self-control?’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:101:3-19:101:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 101:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[74]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> You should also avoid rationalizing. The Bible says: “The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jer. 17:9</a>) Jesus said that it produces “wicked reasonings.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:19-40:15:19" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 15:19</a>) For example, a person who has stopped viewing pornography may, after a time, think that it is “safe” to look at sexually arousing photos because they do not contain outright nudity. Or he might reason, ‘There is nothing wrong with fantasizing about improper desires as long as I don’t carry them out.’ In a sense, that person’s treacherous heart is “planning ahead for the desires of the flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:14-45:13:14" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rom. 13:14</a>) How can you avoid doing that? Be aware of and avoid making small unwise decisions that will lead you to making big unwise decisions, such as giving in to wrongdoing.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span id="footnotesource3" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Reject also any thoughts, or “wicked reasonings,” that tend to excuse wrong behavior.</p>
