<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Study sessions can refresh us, but we can gain even more refreshment when we share with others the encouraging spiritual gems that we find. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:25-20:11:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:25</a> says: “Whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">When we share what we learn with others, we can thereafter remember the points more easily and deepen our understanding. And because those points can benefit others, it makes us happy to share such gems with them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong><em>Try this:</em></strong> In the coming week, look for an opportunity to share what you have learned with someone else. You might do so with a family member, someone in your congregation, a workmate, a schoolmate, a neighbor, or someone you meet in the field ministry. Try to express the information in your own words simply and clearly.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong><em>Remember:</em></strong> Share what you learn to encourage others, not to impress them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:1-46:8:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:1</a>.</p>
