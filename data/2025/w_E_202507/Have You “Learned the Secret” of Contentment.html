He does not feel bitter or angry because of what he lacks. Nevertheless, being content does not mean being complacent. For example, a Christian rightly reaches out for opportunities to expand his service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:1</a>) Even so, he does not lose his joy if privileges of service do not come as quickly as he had expected.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Discontentment can lead to serious consequences. Those who are never satisfied with what they have may work extremely long hours to obtain material things that are not really needed. Sadly, a few Christians have even stolen money and other things they desired. They may have told themselves, ‘I deserve it,’ ‘I have waited long enough,’ or ‘I will pay the money back later.’ Yet, stealing of any kind displeases and dishonors Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:9-20:30:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 30:9</a>) Others have become so disappointed at not receiving a privilege of service that they have given up serving Jehovah altogether. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:9-48:6:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 6:9</a>) How could a dedicated worshipper of Jehovah even think of doing that?

They should have reflected gratefully on what Jehovah had already done for them. In Egypt, where they were brutally treated as slaves, Jehovah brought ten plagues on their captors. After the Israelites were set free, they “plundered the Egyptians” of silver, gold, and clothing.

She relates: “I have a progressive muscle disease that forces me to use a wheelchair and to spend most of the day in bed. I am in pain every day. My doctor recently told me that my prospects do not look good. But I immediately thought, ‘He sees the future differently.’ I’m focused on my hope, which gives me peace of mind. Today, I may have to endure living in this world, but I will fully enjoy the new world!”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[69]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> A contented servant of Jehovah will still face problems. King David suffered the loss of at least three of his children. He was wrongly accused, betrayed, and hunted as a fugitive for years. Still, while enduring a severe trial, he said of Jehovah: “Those who fear him lack nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:9-19:34:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 34:9, 10</a>) Why could he say that? Because although we, as Jehovah’s people, do not expect a trouble free life, we are certain that we will never lack what we truly need. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 145:16</a>) And we can count on Jehovah to sustain us through all our trials. We can be content.</p>
