SONG 97 Life Depends on God’s Word

Can You Still Learn From Basic Bible Teachings?


“I intend always to remind you of these things, although you know them and are well-established in the truth.”​—2 PET. 1:12.


FOCUS
How to apply valuable lessons from basic Bible teachings, even years after you first learned them.


 1. How did Bible teachings affect you when you first learned the truth?

Your answer


BASIC Bible teachings have changed our life. For example, when we learned that God’s name is Jehovah, we took the first step in becoming his friend. (Isa. 42:8) When we learned the true condition of the dead, we no longer wondered whether our dead loved ones were suffering. (Eccl. 9:10) And when we learned about God’s promise of Paradise on earth, we no longer worried about our future. We were confident that our life could last, not just for a short time​—70 or 80 years—​but forever.​—Ps. 37:29; 90:10.
 2. How does 2 Peter 1:12, 13 indicate that even mature Christians benefit from basic Scriptural teachings?

Your answer


2 We must never take for granted the basic teachings of the Bible. In his second letter, the apostle Peter wrote to Christians who were “well-established in the truth.” (Read 2 Peter 1:12, 13.) Now, however, they faced spiritual dangers within the congregation, including false teachers and ungodly men. (2 Pet. 2:1-3) Peter wanted to strengthen his brothers and sisters in order to help them resist these threats. To do so, he reminded them of some of the teachings they had already learned. These teachings would help them to keep their integrity until the end.
 3. Illustrate why all Christians should continue to meditate on basic Bible teachings.

Your answer


3 As we grow in Christian maturity, we may be able to draw new lessons from basic Bible teachings. To illustrate: A skilled chef and one who is a novice may use the same basic ingredients when preparing a dish. But over time, the experienced chef has learned to get the most out of those ingredients and to prepare them in new and interesting ways. Similarly, longtime servants of Jehovah and new Bible students may look at basic Bible truths from different angles. Our circumstances or privileges of service have likely changed since we got baptized. When we apply the teachings that we learned long ago to our current situation, we may discover new and practical lessons. Let us see what mature Christians can learn from three basic Bible teachings.
JEHOVAH IS THE CREATOR
 4. How has learning that Jehovah is the Creator affected us?

Your answer


4 “The one who constructed all things is God.” (Heb. 3:4) We know that our planet and the life on it were made by an all-wise and all-powerful Creator. He made us, so he knows us through and through. What is more, he cares about us. He knows what is best for us. Knowing this simple truth, that Jehovah is the Creator, has affected us in a profound way, giving our life real meaning and purpose.
 5. What truth can help us to cultivate humility? (Isaiah 45:9-12)

Your answer


5 The truth that Jehovah is the Creator can teach us a lesson in humility. After Job became too focused on himself and on other humans, Jehovah reminded him that He is the almighty Creator. (Job 38:1-4) This reminder helped Job to see that God’s ways are superior to man’s ways. In line with this, the prophet Isaiah later wrote: “Should the clay say to the Potter: ‘What are you making?’”​—Read Isaiah 45:9-12.
 6. When might we reflect on Jehovah’s exalted position as our Creator? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


6 As a Christian gains experience, he could begin to put too much trust in his own opinions rather than look to Jehovah and His Word for guidance. (Job 37:23, 24) But what if a person thinks deeply about the incomparable wisdom and greatness of his Creator? (Isa. 40:22; 55:8, 9) This fundamental truth will help him to remain humble and to put his own ideas in perspective.

 7. What did Rahela do to accept a change in direction?

Your answer


7 Rahela, who lives in Slovenia, has found that thinking about her Creator has helped her to accept a change in organizational direction. She admits: “Sometimes, it hasn’t been easy for me to accept decisions made by those who take the lead. For example, even after I watched the 2023 Governing Body Update #8, I was shocked the first time I saw a bearded brother giving a talk. So I prayed to Jehovah to help me adapt to this change.” Rahela recognized that as the Creator of heaven and earth, Jehovah is perfectly capable of guiding his organization in the right direction. If you find it hard to adjust to a new understanding or to accept new direction, why not humbly meditate on the superior wisdom and power of our Creator?​—Rom. 11:33-36.
WHY GOD PERMITS SUFFERING
 8. How has learning why God permits suffering benefited us?

Your answer


8 Why does God permit suffering? Some who have been unable to answer that question have become angry at God or have concluded that he does not exist at all! (Prov. 19:3) By contrast, you have learned that inherited sin and imperfection, not Jehovah, have caused suffering. You have also learned that Jehovah’s patience with humans has allowed millions to come to know him and to see for themselves how Jehovah will end suffering permanently. (2 Pet. 3:9, 15) These truths have reassured you and drawn you closer to him.
 9. In what situations might we recall the reasons why Jehovah permits suffering?

Your answer


9 We understand the need to be patient while we wait for Jehovah to end suffering. Yet, when we or our loved ones experience distress, injustice, or loss, we may wonder why Jehovah is not acting more quickly. (Hab. 1:2, 3) At such times, we are wise to reflect on the reasons why Jehovah allows the righteous to suffer hardship.a (Ps. 34:19) We can also reflect on his purpose to bring suffering to an end once and for all.
10. How has Anne coped with the loss of her mother?

Your answer


10 The truth about suffering can help us to endure. Anne, who lives on the island of Mayotte, in the Indian Ocean, relates: “The loss of my mother a few years ago made me very sad. However, I regularly remind myself that Jehovah is not responsible for suffering. He is eager to get rid of all forms of suffering and resurrect our loved ones. Meditating on those truths provides me with a peace of mind that often surprises me.”
11. How can Jehovah’s reasons for permitting suffering help us to continue preaching?

Your answer


11 Knowing the truth about why God permits suffering can motivate us to keep preaching. After explaining that Jehovah’s patience means salvation for those who repent, Peter wrote: “Consider what sort of people you ought to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion.” (2 Pet. 3:11) Among those “deeds of godly devotion” is our field ministry. Like our Father, we love people. We want them to live in God’s righteous new world. Jehovah is patiently giving the people in your community an opportunity to worship him. What a privilege you have to be God’s fellow worker and to help as many as possible to learn about him before the end comes!​—1 Cor. 3:9.
WE ARE LIVING IN “THE LAST DAYS”
12. How has learning that we are living in “the last days” benefited us?

Your answer


12 The Bible accurately describes what people would be like during “the last days.” (2 Tim. 3:1-5) We have only to look around us to see how this prophecy is being fulfilled. As we see the attitudes of people worsen, we become more convinced than ever that God’s Word is trustworthy.​—2 Tim. 3:13-15.
13. In harmony with Jesus’ illustration found at Luke 12:15-21, what might we ask ourselves?

Your answer


13 We respond to the truth that we are living in the last days with a sense of urgency. Note what we can learn about urgency from Jesus’ illustration found at Luke 12:15-21. (Read.) Why was the rich man called “unreasonable”? Not because the man was wealthy, but because he had the wrong priorities. He stored up “treasure for himself but [was] not rich toward God.” What made the matter so urgent? God told the man: “This night they are demanding your life from you.” Today, as this system of things draws to a close, we might ask ourselves: ‘What do my goals reveal about my sense of urgency? What about the goals I help my children to set? Do I use my strength, my time, and my financial resources primarily to build up treasures for myself or to store up treasures in heaven?’
14. As illustrated by Miki’s experience, why is it wise to meditate on the Scriptural evidence that we are living in the last days?

Your answer


14 Our entire outlook on life can change when we think about the evidence that we are living in the last days. That is what happened to a sister named Miki. She relates: “When I graduated from school, my heart was leading me toward a career in the study of animals. I also had the goal of regular pioneering and of serving where the need is greater. Mature friends advised me to think very carefully about whether it was realistic for me to pursue the secular career I wanted and still reach my spiritual goals. They reminded me that this system will soon come to an end. On the other hand, in the new world, I will have an eternity to study as many animals as I like. So I chose a short, practical program. This allowed me to get employment to support me in regular pioneering and later to move to Ecuador, where the need is greater.” Miki and her husband now serve in the circuit work in that country.
15. How might people still respond to the good news? Give an example. (See also pictures.)

Your answer


15 We should not be discouraged when people initially reject the good news. People can change. Consider the example of Jesus’ half brother James. He watched Jesus grow up, become the Messiah, and teach as no other human had taught. Yet, for years, James did not follow Jesus. Only after Jesus was resurrected did his brother become a disciple​—and a zealous one at that!b (John 7:5; Gal. 2:9) Do not underestimate the value of reaching out to relatives who have not yet shown interest or of calling again on those who have not accepted the Kingdom message. Remember that we are living in the last days, so our preaching work is urgent. What you say to them today may affect them later, perhaps even after the great tribulation starts.c




What can motivate us not to give up on our unbelieving relatives? (See paragraph 15)e




REMAIN GRATEFUL FOR JEHOVAH’S REMINDERS
16. How have you benefited from Jehovah’s reminders? (See also the box “Use Them to Help Others.”)

Your answer


16 Some of the spiritual food that we receive is prepared for people who have never heard basic Bible truths. For example, our weekly public talk, certain articles and videos on jw.org, and our public magazines are designed primarily for non-Witnesses. Even so, we benefit from those reminders. They deepen our love for Jehovah, strengthen our faith in his Word, and help us to be more effective when teaching basic truths to others.​—Ps. 19:7.
Use Them to Help Others
When you read an article, watch a video, or listen to a talk that has been prepared for newly interested people, consider how you can use the material to help others. You might ask yourself:
  ‘What evidence is being used to convince the audience?’

  ‘Is there an effective illustration that I could use when I teach this truth to someone?’

  ‘Who might be interested in this topic, and when could I share this truth with him?’




17. In what situations might you reflect on basic Bible teachings?

Your answer


17 As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we are thrilled when our understanding of a Scriptural truth is clarified. Yet, we are also deeply grateful for the fundamental Bible teachings that drew us to the truth in the first place. If we are ever tempted to insist on our own opinion rather than to submit to guidance from Jehovah’s organization, we can humbly remember who is directing that organization​—the almighty and all-wise Creator. When we or a loved one is enduring a trial, we can be patient and reflect on why Jehovah has allowed suffering. And when deciding where to focus our time and resources, we can recall the urgency of these last days. May Jehovah’s reminders continue to strengthen us, motivate us, and make us wise.
