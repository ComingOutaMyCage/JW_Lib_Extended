SONG 111 Our Reasons for Joy

Have You “Learned the Secret” of Contentment?


“I have learned to be self-sufficient regardless of my circumstances.”​—PHIL. 4:11.


FOCUS
Learning to be content by cultivating gratitude, by being focused and humble, and by meditating on our hope for the future.


 1. What does contentment mean, and what does it not mean?

Your answer


ARE you a contented person? Someone who is content finds joy and peace by focusing on his current blessings. He does not feel bitter or angry because of what he lacks. Nevertheless, being content does not mean being complacent. For example, a Christian rightly reaches out for opportunities to expand his service. (Rom. 12:1; 1 Tim. 3:1) Even so, he does not lose his joy if privileges of service do not come as quickly as he had expected.
 2. Why is discontentment so dangerous?

Your answer


2 Discontentment can lead to serious consequences. Those who are never satisfied with what they have may work extremely long hours to obtain material things that are not really needed. Sadly, a few Christians have even stolen money and other things they desired. They may have told themselves, ‘I deserve it,’ ‘I have waited long enough,’ or ‘I will pay the money back later.’ Yet, stealing of any kind displeases and dishonors Jehovah. (Prov. 30:9) Others have become so disappointed at not receiving a privilege of service that they have given up serving Jehovah altogether. (Gal. 6:9) How could a dedicated worshipper of Jehovah even think of doing that? The problem may be that the person has stopped cultivating contentment.
 3. What assuring truth do we learn about at Philippians 4:11, 12?

Your answer


3 We all can cultivate contentment. The apostle Paul wrote that he had “learned to be self-sufficient regardless of [his] circumstances.” (Read Philippians 4:11, 12.) He wrote those words while imprisoned. Even so, he had not lost his joy. He had “learned the secret” of contentment. If we struggle to be content, Paul’s words and experience can assure us that we can develop contentment. We should not expect that we will naturally feel content with our circumstances. Rather, we must learn to be content. How? Let us discuss qualities that will help us learn the secret of contentment.
CULTIVATE GRATITUDE
 4. How does having a grateful spirit help us to be content? (1 Thessalonians 5:18)

Your answer


4 A grateful spirit nurtures contentment. (Read 1 Thessalonians 5:18.) For example, when we are truly thankful for the necessities of life, we are less likely to be overly concerned about the things we want but do not have. When we reflect appreciatively on the privileges of service we enjoy now, we will focus on doing our best in those assignments instead of becoming obsessed with receiving a new privilege. No wonder the Scriptures urge us to include expressions of thanks to Jehovah in our prayers! Having a grateful spirit helps us to feel “the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.”​—Phil. 4:6, 7.
 5. For what reasons should the Israelites have been grateful? (See also picture.)

Your answer


5 Consider what happened to the Israelites. On a number of occasions, they complained to Jehovah that they lacked the food they used to enjoy in Egypt. (Num. 11:4-6) Granted, life in the wilderness was not easy. What would have helped them to be content? They should have reflected gratefully on what Jehovah had already done for them. In Egypt, where they were brutally treated as slaves, Jehovah brought ten plagues on their captors. After the Israelites were set free, they “plundered the Egyptians” of silver, gold, and clothing. (Ex. 12:35, 36) When the Israelites were chased to the edge of the Red Sea, Jehovah miraculously parted the waters. And as they traveled through the wilderness, he fed them daily with manna. What, then, was the problem? The Israelites were discontent, not because they lacked the food they needed, but because they were not grateful for what they already had.




Why did the Israelites become discontent? (See paragraph 5)




 6. What are some ways that we can cultivate gratitude?

Your answer


6 How, then, can you cultivate gratitude? First, make time each day to think about the good things you enjoy. You might even write down two or three things you are grateful for. (Lam. 3:22, 23) Second, express your gratitude. Take the initiative to thank others for what they do for you. Above all, thank Jehovah regularly. (Ps. 75:1) Third, choose as close friends those who are thankful. Gratitude is contagious; so is discontentment. (Deut. 1:26-28; 2 Tim. 3:1, 2, 5) When we are focused on expressing gratitude, we are less likely to be consumed by feelings of discontent.
 7. How did Aci cultivate gratitude, and with what result?

Your answer


7 Consider what happened to Aci, who lives in Indonesia. She admits: “During the COVID-19 pandemic, I began to compare my circumstances with those of my fellow believers. As a result, I became discontent.” (Gal. 6:4) What helped her to change her thinking? Aci says: “I started to count the blessings I was receiving each day and to reflect on the many good things I had gained from being part of God’s organization. Then I expressed my gratitude to Jehovah. As a result, I came to feel truly content.” If you have negative thoughts overwhelming you, could you take similar steps to regain a grateful spirit?
STAY FOCUSED AND REMAIN HUMBLE
 8. What trap did Baruch fall into?

Your answer


8 The prophet Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch, temporarily fell into a trap. Baruch had a difficult assignment, namely, to support Jeremiah as he delivered a strong message to an ungrateful nation. At one point, Baruch lost his focus. Instead of concentrating on what Jehovah wanted him to do, he apparently began thinking too much about himself and what he wanted to do. Through Jeremiah, Jehovah told Baruch: “You are seeking great things for yourself. Stop seeking such things.” (Jer. 45:3-5) In other words, he was saying: “Be content with your present circumstances.” Baruch accepted the correction and continued to enjoy Jehovah’s approval.
 9. According to 1 Corinthians 4:6, 7, what will humility move us to recognize? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


9 At times, a Christian may feel that he is entitled to a certain privilege of service. He might be very talented, hardworking, or experienced​—or perhaps all three. However, others may receive the very privilege he would like to have. How could he reason on the matter? He could reflect on what the apostle Paul wrote, as found at 1 Corinthians 4:6, 7. (Read.) Every privilege we receive and every talent we have comes from Jehovah. We do not earn or deserve these gifts. They are all expressions of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.​—Rom. 12:3, 6; Eph. 2:8, 9.




Any gift we have is an expression of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness (See paragraph 9)b




10. How can we cultivate humility?

Your answer


10 We can cultivate humility by thinking deeply about the example that Jesus set for us. Consider what happened on the night that Jesus washed his apostles’ feet. The apostle John wrote: “Jesus, knowing [1] that the Father had given all things into his hands and [2] that he came from God and [3] was going to God, . . . started to wash the feet of the disciples.” (John 13:3-5) Jesus could have felt entitled to have his own feet washed. But during his life on earth, he never felt that he deserved a more prosperous and comfortable life. (Luke 9:58) Jesus was humble; he was content. He set a perfect pattern for us.​—John 13:15.
11. How has humility helped Dennis to feel content?

Your answer


11 Dennis, from the Netherlands, has tried to follow Jesus’ pattern of humility, but it has not been easy. He says: “Sometimes I notice feelings of pride or discontent growing in me, such as when someone else receives a privilege of service. When that happens, I study the topic of humility. In the JW Library® app, I have tagged certain scriptures about humility so that I can find them quickly and reread them. I have also downloaded to my phone some talks about humility, and I listen to them often.a I have learned that all the work we do is so that we can glorify Jehovah, not ourselves. Each of us plays a small role in what Jehovah is accomplishing.” If you begin to feel dissatisfied with your situation, take steps to cultivate humility. This will strengthen your friendship with Jehovah and help you to feel content.​—Jas. 4:6, 8.
MEDITATE ON YOUR HOPE
12. What hope for the future helps us to be content? (Isaiah 65:21-25)

Your answer


12 We feel more content when we meditate on the wonderful hope ahead of us. Jehovah’s own words recorded by the prophet Isaiah acknowledge how frustrating life can be today and assure us that Jehovah will relieve those frustrations. (Read Isaiah 65:21-25.) We will live in safe and comfortable housing. We will have meaningful work, and we will eat healthful and delicious food. We will never again worry about dangers to ourselves or to our children. (Isa. 32:17, 18; Ezek. 34:25) Our future is wonderful, and it is secure.
13. In what circumstances might we especially need to focus on our hope?

Your answer


13 Now more than ever, we need to focus on our hope. Why? Because we are living in “the last days” and we all have problems that are “hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) Jehovah daily helps us to endure by giving us the guidance, strength, and support we need. (Ps. 145:14) In addition, our Christian hope can sustain us during difficult times. Perhaps you struggle to provide for your family’s material needs. Does this mean that you will always have to struggle to survive? Absolutely not! Jehovah has promised to give you what you need​—and much, much more—​in Paradise. (Ps. 9:18; 72:12-14) You may be dealing with chronic pain, depression, or some other debilitating health condition. Is this simply your lot in life, with no hope of relief​—ever? Not at all. Sickness and death will vanish in God’s new world. (Rev. 21:3, 4) That hope helps us to feel content​—free of anger and bitterness—​right now. We can feel content while facing injustice or loss, enduring sickness, or any other trial. Why? Because no matter how difficult our present challenges may be, we know that our “tribulation is momentary” and that the new world will soon provide permanent relief.​—2 Cor. 4:17, 18.
14. How can we strengthen our hope?

Your answer


14 Since hope is vital to our contentment, how can we strengthen it? Just as a person may need to put on eyeglasses to see distant objects more clearly, we might need to take appropriate steps to strengthen our hope so that we can see the future Paradise more clearly. When we are consumed by worry about our finances, we can picture what our life will be like when money, debt, and economic inequality are gone. If we are anxious about privileges of service that we have not yet received, we can think about how insignificant such anxieties will be after we reach perfection and have served Jehovah for thousands of years. (1 Tim. 6:19) We may at first find it challenging to meditate on the future instead of worrying about the present. Over time, however, looking to the future that Jehovah has promised can become natural to us.
15. What do you learn from Christa’s comments?

Your answer


15 Consider how hope has helped Christa, who is married to Dennis, quoted earlier. She relates: “I have a progressive muscle disease that forces me to use a wheelchair and to spend most of the day in bed. I am in pain every day. My doctor recently told me that my prospects do not look good. But I immediately thought, ‘He sees the future differently.’ I’m focused on my hope, which gives me peace of mind. Today, I may have to endure living in this world, but I will fully enjoy the new world!”
“THOSE WHO FEAR HIM LACK NOTHING”
16. Why could King David write that those who fear Jehovah “lack nothing”?

Your answer


16 A contented servant of Jehovah will still face problems. King David suffered the loss of at least three of his children. He was wrongly accused, betrayed, and hunted as a fugitive for years. Still, while enduring a severe trial, he said of Jehovah: “Those who fear him lack nothing.” (Ps. 34:9, 10) Why could he say that? Because although we, as Jehovah’s people, do not expect a trouble free life, we are certain that we will never lack what we truly need. (Ps. 145:16) And we can count on Jehovah to sustain us through all our trials. We can be content.
17. Why are you determined to learn the secret of contentment?

Your answer


17 Jehovah wants you to be content. (Ps. 131:1, 2) So endeavor to learn the secret of contentment. If you work hard to cultivate gratitude, to remain focused and humble, and to strengthen your hope, you will be able to say: “Yes, I am content.”​—Ps. 16:5, 6.
