Others are reluctant to offer counsel, or advice, and feel awkward when delivering it. Either way, all of us are obliged to provide advice from time to time. Why? Because Jesus said that his true followers are identified by the love that they show for one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) And one way that we prove our love is by giving our brothers and sisters counsel when it is needed. God’s Word says that “sweet friendship” springs from, or grows because of, “sincere counsel.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:9-20:27:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 27:9</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:2, 3</a>) One of the ways they do that is by providing Bible-based counsel in their talks to the congregation.

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p71" data-pid="71">Note some of the things that make Jesus a “Wonderful Counselor,” and consider how we can follow his example.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p72" data-pid="72">  <strong>Jesus knew what to say.</strong> He always knew the right thing to say because he based his advice on Jehovah’s wisdom, never his own. He told his disciples: “The things I say to you I do not speak of my own originality.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:10-43:14:10" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 14:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Although we may have accumulated a lot of experience and wisdom in life, we must make sure that the counsel we give is based, not on our own thoughts, but on God’s Word.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p74" data-pid="74">  <strong>Jesus knew when to give advice.</strong> He did not tell his disciples everything they needed to know all at once. Rather, he waited until it was the right time to counsel his disciples, and he told them only as much as they could bear.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:12-43:16:12" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 16:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75"><strong>The lesson:</strong> When counseling someone, we need to wait until it is the right “time to speak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:7</a>) If we overwhelm the person with information, he may become confused and discouraged. So we do well to tell him only as much as he needs to know to deal with the challenge he is facing.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p76" data-pid="76">  <strong>Jesus knew how to be tactful.</strong> Jesus repeatedly had to give his apostles counsel about being humble. On each occasion, though, he was mild and respectful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:1-40:18:5" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 18:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77"><strong>The lesson:</strong> Even if we must give someone the same counsel repeatedly, we will be most effective if we remain mild and speak respectfully.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> When someone asks us for advice, what should be our first reaction? We may be flattered and want to help immediately. But we should first ask ourselves, ‘Am I qualified to give advice in this area?’ Sometimes, the best way we can help is by not giving advice but instead directing the person to someone who is qualified to provide guidance on that subject.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Consider this example. Suppose that a close friend develops a serious medical condition. He tells you that he has started researching the treatment options that are available to him, and then he asks you to give your opinion on which treatment you feel is better. You may have strong personal opinions on the matter, but you have no medical qualifications or training in dealing with the illness. In that case, the best way you can help your friend is to assist him in finding someone who is qualified to help him.</p>

In what way? The apostle Paul said that a person might take a false step before he is aware of it. So the elders should first of all prepare the person to receive the counsel.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> Giving unsolicited counsel can be like trying to grow plants in hardened soil. Before a farmer starts sowing, he tills the soil. This softens the ground and prepares it to receive the seed. He then <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>plants the seed. Finally, he waters the seed to help it grow. Similarly, before an elder gives unsolicited counsel, he does well to prepare the ground, so to speak. For example, at a convenient time to talk, the elder assures the brother that he has his best interests at heart. If a counselor has the reputation of being loving and kind, it will be easier for others to accept his advice.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[53]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> During the discussion, the elder can continue to soften the ground by acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes and needs counsel from time to time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23</a>) In a calm voice and with deep respect, the elder clearly shows him from the Scriptures how he has taken a false step. Once the brother acknowledges that he has made a mistake, the elder “plants the seed” by explaining to him, in simple terms, what he needs to do to try to correct the situation. Finally, the elder “waters” the seed by sincerely commending the brother and by praying with him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:15-59:5:15" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 5:15</a>.</p>
