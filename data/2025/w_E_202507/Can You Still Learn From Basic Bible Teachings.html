To illustrate: A skilled chef and one who is a novice may use the same basic ingredients when preparing a dish. But over time, the experienced chef has learned to get the most out of those ingredients and to prepare them in new and interesting ways. Similarly, longtime servants of Jehovah and new Bible students may look at basic Bible truths from different angles. Our circumstances or privileges of service have likely changed since we got baptized. When we apply the teachings that we learned long ago to our current situation, we may discover new and practical lessons.

Yet, we are also deeply grateful for the fundamental Bible teachings that drew us to the truth in the first place. If we are ever tempted to insist on our own opinion rather than to submit to guidance from Jehovah’s organization, we can humbly remember who is directing that organization​—the almighty and all-wise Creator. When we or a loved one is enduring a trial, we can be patient and reflect on why Jehovah has allowed suffering. And when deciding where to focus our time and resources, we can recall the urgency of these last days. May Jehovah’s reminders continue to strengthen us, motivate us, and make us wise.</p>
