SONG 7 Jehovah, Our Strength

Look to Jehovah for Comfort


“Praised be . . . the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.”​—2 COR. 1:3.


FOCUS
Lessons we learn from how Jehovah comforted the Jewish exiles.


 1. Describe the situation of the Jewish exiles.

Your answer


IMAGINE how the Jewish exiles in Babylon must have felt. They had seen their homeland destroyed. Because of their sins and those of their forefathers, they had been taken from their homes and sent to a foreign land. (2 Chron. 36:15, 16, 20, 21) Granted, in Babylon the exiles had some freedom to carry out their daily affairs. (Jer. 29:4-7) Yet, life was not easy, and it definitely was not the life they would have chosen. How did they feel about their situation? Note the words of one faithful exile: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat. We wept when we remembered Zion.” (Ps. 137:1) The downhearted exiles needed comfort, but where could they find it?
2-3. (a) What did Jehovah do for the Jewish exiles? (b) What will we discuss in this article?

Your answers


2 Jehovah is “the God of all comfort.” (2 Cor. 1:3) As a loving God, he takes pleasure in comforting all who draw close to him. Jehovah knew that some of the exiles would accept his discipline and return to him. (Isa. 59:20) So more than 100 years before the exile, he inspired the prophet Isaiah to write the book that bears his name. For what purpose? Isaiah states: “‘Comfort, comfort my people,’ says your God.” (Isa. 40:1) Yes, by means of the prophet’s writings, Jehovah provided the comfort that the Jewish exiles would need.
3 Like those Jewish exiles, we too need comfort from time to time. In this article, we will consider three ways that Jehovah comforted the exiles: (1) He promised to forgive repentant ones, (2) he gave his people hope, and (3) he calmed their fears. As we discuss these points, note how we can benefit from Jehovah’s reassuring words.
JEHOVAH MERCIFULLY FORGIVES US
 4. How did Jehovah show that he is a merciful God? (Isaiah 55:7)

Your answer


4 Jehovah is “the Father of tender mercies.” (2 Cor. 1:3) He showed that quality when he promised to forgive repentant exiles. (Read Isaiah 55:7.) He said: “With everlasting loyal love I will have mercy on you.” (Isa. 54:8) How would Jehovah show his mercy? Although the Jews as a people would still have to suffer the consequences of their actions, Jehovah promised that they would not remain in Babylon forever. They would remain in exile only for a limited period of time. (Isa. 40:2) How these words must have comforted and reassured repentant ones among them!
 5. Why do we have even more reason than the captive Jews did to appreciate Jehovah’s mercy?

Your answer


5 What do we learn? Jehovah is willing to forgive his servants in a large way. Today we have even more reason than the captive Jews did to appreciate this fact. How so? We understand the basis for Jehovah’s forgiveness. Hundreds of years after Isaiah prophesied, Jehovah sent his beloved Son to earth to provide a ransom for all repentant sinners. That sacrifice provides the basis for sins to be “blotted out”​—completely erased. (Acts 3:19; Isa. 1:18; Eph. 1:7) What a merciful God we serve!
 6. How can we benefit by focusing on Jehovah’s mercy? (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Jehovah’s inspired words found at Isaiah 55:7 can comfort us if we are consumed by feelings of guilt. Some of us may continue to feel guilty for a past mistake even after we have repented. That may especially be the case if we are still suffering the consequences of our mistake. Yet, if we have confessed our sins and corrected our course, we can be sure that Jehovah has forgiven us. And when Jehovah forgives, he chooses not to remember our sin. (Compare Jeremiah 31:34.) So if Jehovah does not dwell on our past sins, neither should we. What counts with Jehovah is what we are doing now, not what mistakes we made in the past. (Ezek. 33:14-16) And soon, our Father of tender mercies will permanently free us from the consequences of our mistakes.




What counts with Jehovah is, not what mistakes we made in the past, but what we are doing now (See paragraph 6)




 7. What can move us to seek help if we have been hiding a sin?

Your answer


7 What should we do if we are afflicted by a guilty conscience because of hiding a serious sin? The Bible encourages us to ask the elders for help. (Jas. 5:14, 15) However, we may not find it easy to admit our wrongdoing. But we will be moved to approach those faithful men if we are repentant and if we remember that Jehovah and the men he has appointed to help us will lovingly show mercy. Consider how Jehovah’s mercy comforted a brother named Arthur,a whose conscience was deeply troubled. “For about a year, I viewed pornography,” said Arthur. “But after hearing a talk about the conscience, I confessed my sin to my wife and to the elders. After that, I finally felt relief, but I was still weighed down by what I had done. The elders reminded me that Jehovah had not rejected me. He disciplines us because he loves us. Their kind words reached my heart and helped me to reset my thinking.” Today, Arthur serves as a pioneer and a ministerial servant. How comforting it is to know that Jehovah shows us mercy if we are repentant!
JEHOVAH GIVES US HOPE
 8. (a) What hope did Jehovah give the exiles? (b) According to Isaiah 40:29-31, what effect could hope have on repentant Jews?

Your answers


8 From a human standpoint, the Jewish captives were in a hopeless situation. The Babylonian World Power was known for refusing to release its captives. (Isa. 14:17) However, Jehovah provided his people with hope. He promised to set his people free, and nothing could stop him. (Isa. 44:26; 55:12) In Jehovah’s eyes, Babylon was like a film of dust. (Isa. 40:15) With a puff of air, the dust is gone. What effect could hope have on the exiles? It would comfort them. But it could do more. Isaiah wrote: “Those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.” (Read Isaiah 40:29-31.) Yes, hope would invigorate them; they would “soar on wings like eagles.”
 9. What would have given the exiles reason to trust in Jehovah’s promises?

Your answer


9 Jehovah also gave the exiles reason to trust in his promises. How? Think about the prophecies that had already been fulfilled. They knew that Assyria had conquered the northern kingdom of Israel and taken the people into exile. (Isa. 8:4) They saw the Babylonians destroy Jerusalem and take its inhabitants into exile. (Isa. 39:5-7) They were alive when King Zedekiah was blinded and deported to Babylon. (Jer. 39:7; Ezek. 12:12, 13) Everything that Jehovah had foretold came true. (Isa. 42:9; 46:10) How all of this must have strengthened their faith that Jehovah’s promise of a liberation would also come true!
10. What can help us to remain hopeful during these last days?

Your answer


10 What do we learn? When we feel low, hope can comfort us and help us to regain power. We live in critical times and are facing some powerful enemies. Yet, we must not despair. Jehovah has given us a wonderful hope​—everlasting life in true peace and security. We must keep that hope bright in our mind and heart. Otherwise, our hope could become dim like a view of a beautiful landscape that is blurred because we are looking through a dirty window. How can we “clean the window,” keeping our hope bright? We can regularly make time to imagine how wonderful our life will be in the new world. We can read articles, watch videos, and listen to songs that discuss our hope. And we can talk to Jehovah in prayer about the promises we eagerly wait to see fulfilled.
11. What helps one sister who has chronic health problems to regain power?

Your answer


11 Consider how hope has comforted and strengthened a sister named Joy, who has chronic health problems. She says: “When I feel overwhelmed, I share my deepest feelings with Jehovah, knowing that he understands me. In response, Jehovah has given me ‘the power beyond what is normal.’” (2 Cor. 4:7) Joy also pictures herself in the new world, where “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” (Isa. 33:24) If we too pour out our heart to Jehovah and focus on our hope, we can regain power.
12. What reasons do we have to trust in Jehovah’s promises? (See also picture.)

Your answer


12 As he did with the exiles, Jehovah has also given us many reasons to trust in his promises. Think about the prophecies that we see being fulfilled. For example, we see a world power that is “partly strong and partly fragile.” (Dan. 2:42, 43) We also hear of “earthquakes in one place after another,” and we share in preaching to “all the nations.” (Matt. 24:7, 14) These prophecies and many others strengthen our faith in Jehovah’s comforting promises that are yet to be fulfilled.




Prophecies that we see being fulfilled today give us reasons to trust in Jehovah’s promises (See paragraph 12)




JEHOVAH CALMS OUR FEARS
13. (a) What challenges would the Jews face at the time of their liberation? (b) As described at Isaiah 41:10-13, how did Jehovah comfort the Jewish exiles?

Your answers


13 Although Jehovah comforted the exiles with a wonderful hope, he knew that they would face challenges at the time of their liberation. Jehovah had foretold that toward the end of the Jewish exile, a conqueror would devastate the surrounding nations and threaten Babylon. (Isa. 41:2-5) Would the Jews need to be worried? Jehovah comforted his people in advance, saying: “Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Do not be anxious, for I am your God.” (Read Isaiah 41:10-13.) What did he mean by “I am your God”? He was not reminding the Jews to worship him​—that need was obvious. Rather, he was reminding them that he was still on their side.​—Ps. 118:6.
14. How else did Jehovah calm the exiles’ fears?

Your answer


14 Jehovah also calmed the exiles’ fears by reminding them of his unlimited power and knowledge. He invited the Jewish exiles to look up at the starry heavens. He told them that he not only created the stars but also knew all the stars by name. (Isa. 40:25-28) How much more so, then, does he know the personal name of each of his servants! And if Jehovah had the power to create the stars, he definitely has the power to help his people. Yes, the Jewish exiles had no reason to be anxious or afraid.
15. How did God prepare the Jewish exiles for what lay ahead?

Your answer


15 Jehovah also prepared his people for what lay ahead. In an earlier part of the book of Isaiah, God told the nation: “Enter your inner rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by.” (Isa. 26:20) This passage may have had an initial fulfillment when Babylon was conquered by King Cyrus. An ancient Greek historian says that when Cyrus entered Babylon, he “gave [his soldiers] orders to cut down all whom they found out of doors.” Imagine how scared the inhabitants of Babylon would have felt! But the Jewish exiles may well have been spared because they obeyed Jehovah’s instructions.
16. Why should we not feel overly anxious about our future? (See also picture.)

Your answer


16 What do we learn? We will soon face the greatest tribulation in human history. When it begins, people in general will be confused and terrified. But not Jehovah’s people. We know that Jehovah is our God. We will stand erect, knowing that “[our] deliverance is getting near.” (Luke 21:28) Even when a coalition of nations attacks us, we will stand firm. Jehovah will give us both angelic protection and lifesaving instructions. How will those instructions be conveyed to us? We will have to wait and see. However, we will likely receive such instructions through our congregations. In a sense, these may be our “inner rooms,” where we will find safety. How can we prepare for what lies ahead? We must draw close to our brothers and sisters, willingly obey theocratic direction, and be convinced that Jehovah is leading our organization.​—Heb. 10:24, 25; 13:17.




By reflecting on Jehovah’s power and ability to save us, we will not need to feel overly anxious during the great tribulation (See paragraph 16)b




17. How can you look to Jehovah for comfort?

Your answer


17 Although the Jewish exiles would be in a difficult situation, Jehovah provided them with the comfort they would need. He will do the same for us. So no matter what tomorrow may bring, continue to look to Jehovah for comfort. Yes, trust in his great mercy. Keep your hope alive. Remember, with Jehovah as your God, you have nothing to fear.
