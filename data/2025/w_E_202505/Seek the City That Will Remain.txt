SONG 21 Keep On Seeking First the Kingdom

Seek the City That Will Remain


“We are earnestly seeking the [city] to come.”​—HEB. 13:14.


FOCUS
How Hebrews chapter 13 can benefit us today and in the future.


 1. What did Jesus foretell would happen to first-century Jerusalem?

Your answer


A FEW days before his death, Jesus Christ gave a detailed prophecy that had its first fulfillment during the last days of the Jewish system of things. He warned that the city of Jerusalem would one day be “surrounded by encamped armies.” (Luke 21:20) Jesus told his followers that as soon as they saw those armies​—which turned out to be the Roman armies—​they were to leave the area immediately.​—Luke 21:21, 22.
 2. What reminder did the apostle Paul give the Hebrew Christians in Judea and Jerusalem?

Your answer


2 Just a few years before the Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem, the apostle Paul wrote the powerful letter now known as the book of Hebrews. In that letter, Paul gave Christians in Judea and Jerusalem vital counsel that would help them prepare for what lay ahead. And what exactly lay ahead? Jerusalem was going to be destroyed. If those Christians hoped to survive, they would have to be ready to abandon their homes and businesses. So regarding the city of Jerusalem, Paul wrote: “We do not have here a city that remains.” Then he added: “But we are earnestly seeking the one to come.”​—Heb. 13:14.
 3. What is “the city having real foundations,” and why do we seek it?

Your answer


3 Christians who decided to abandon Jerusalem and Judea likely faced reproach and ridicule, but that decision saved their lives. Today we are mocked because we do not place our trust in humans or seek a secure and comfortable life in this world. Why, then, do we make that choice? We know that this system of things is temporary. We are seeking “the city having real foundations,” that is, “the one to come,” God’s Kingdom.a (Heb. 11:10; Matt. 6:33) Each subheading in this article will consider: (1) how Paul’s inspired counsel helped first-century Christians to keep seeking “the [city] to come,” (2) how Paul prepared them for future events, and (3) how his counsel helps us today.
TRUST IN THE ONE WHO WILL NEVER ABANDON YOU
 4. Why was Jerusalem important to Christians?

Your answer


4 Jerusalem was important to Christians. The first-century Christian congregation was established there in 33 C.E., and its governing body was based in that city. Moreover, many Christians owned homes and had accumulated material possessions in the city. Yet, Jesus warned his followers that they would have to get out of Jerusalem and even out of Judea.​—Matt. 24:16.
 5. How did Paul prepare the Christians for what was coming?

Your answer


5 To prepare the Christians for what was coming, Paul helped them to focus on how Jehovah viewed the city of Jerusalem. Paul reminded them that from Jehovah’s perspective, the temple, the priesthood, and the sacrifices being offered in Jerusalem were no longer sacred. (Heb. 8:13) Most of the city’s inhabitants had rejected the Messiah. Jerusalem’s temple was no longer the center of pure worship of Jehovah, and it would be destroyed.​—Luke 13:34, 35.
 6. Why was Paul’s reminder found at Hebrews 13:5, 6 timely for Christians?

Your answer


6 When Paul wrote to the Hebrews, Jerusalem was a thriving city. A Roman author of that era called Jerusalem “by far the most famous city of the East.” Jews from many lands traveled there yearly to observe the festivals, which contributed to a thriving economy. No doubt some Christians also benefited from this favorable economic situation. Perhaps that is why Paul told them: “Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things.” He then quoted a powerful assurance found in the Scriptures, expressing Jehovah’s personal guarantee: “I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.” (Read Hebrews 13:5, 6; Deut. 31:6; Ps. 118:6) Christians living in Jerusalem and Judea would need this assurance. Why? Because shortly after receiving this letter, they would be obliged to leave behind their homes, their businesses, and most of their belongings. Then they would have to face what lay ahead of them.
 7. Why should we strengthen our trust in Jehovah now?

Your answer


7 Lesson for us: What lies ahead for us? The end of this present system of things in the “great tribulation.” (Matt. 24:21) Like the first-century Christians, we must stay awake and be ready. (Luke 21:34-36) During the great tribulation, we may have to leave behind some or all of our belongings, trusting completely that Jehovah will never abandon his people. Even now, before that tribulation breaks out, we have an opportunity to show where we place our trust. Ask yourself, ‘Do my actions and goals reveal that I put my trust, not in riches, but in the God who promises to care for me?’ (1 Tim. 6:17) Of course, although we can draw lessons from what happened in the first century, the future “great tribulation” will be unprecedented. So how will we know exactly what to do when that tribulation begins?
OBEY THOSE TAKING THE LEAD
 8. What instructions did Jesus give to his disciples?

Your answer


8 A few years after receiving Paul’s letter to the Hebrews, Christians saw the Roman armies surround the city of Jerusalem. That signaled the time for them to flee; the city of Jerusalem would be destroyed. (Matt. 24:3; Luke 21:20, 24) But where would their flight lead them? Jesus had simply said: “Let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains.” (Luke 21:21) There were many mountains in the region. So in what direction would they flee?
 9. Why might Christians have wondered which mountains to flee to? (See also map.)

Your answer


9 Consider some of the mountains to which Christians could have fled: the mountains of Samaria, the mountains in Galilee, Mount Hermon and the mountains of Lebanon, and the mountains across the Jordan. (See map.) Some of the cities in those mountainous areas may have appeared to be safe havens. The city of Gamla, for example, was situated on the rough ridge of a high mountain and was extremely difficult to reach. Some Jews viewed that city as an ideal place of refuge. However, Gamla became the site of a vicious battle between the Jews and the Romans, and many of its inhabitants died.b




There were many mountains to which the early Christians could have fled, but not all proved to be safe (See paragraph 9)




10-11. (a) How might Jehovah have provided guidance? (Hebrews 13:7, 17) (b) How did Christians benefit from obeying those taking the lead? (See also picture.)

Your answers


10 It appears that Jehovah guided the Christians by means of those who were taking the lead in the congregation. Historian Eusebius later wrote: “The people of the congregation in Jerusalem, by divine providence, received a revelation given to approved men; they were commanded . . . to migrate from the city before the war and to settle in a certain city of Perea called Pella.” Pella seems to have been an ideal choice. It was not far from Jerusalem, making it relatively easy to reach. It was primarily a Gentile city and for the most part unaffected by the fanatical Jewish freedom fighters and their battles with the Romans.​—See map.
11 The Christians who fled to the mountains applied Paul’s counsel to “be obedient to those who are taking the lead” in the congregation. (Read Hebrews 13:7, 17.) As a result, God’s people survived. History confirms that God did not abandon those “awaiting the city having real foundations”​—God’s Kingdom.​—Heb. 11:10.




Pella was just out of harm’s way (See paragraphs 10-11)




12-13. How has Jehovah guided his people during critical times?

Your answer


12 Lesson for us: Jehovah uses those taking the lead to provide his people with specific direction. The Scriptures are filled with examples of how Jehovah has raised up shepherds to guide his people during critical times. (Deut. 31:23; Ps. 77:20) And we today have seen ample evidence that Jehovah continues to use those taking the lead.
13 For example, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, “those . . . taking the lead” gave needed direction. The elders received instructions for meeting the spiritual needs of their brothers and sisters. Shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic, we held a landmark convention in more than 500 languages via Internet, TV, and radio. The flow of spiritual food did not stop. As a result, we remained united. We can be confident that no matter what trials we may face in the future, Jehovah will continue to help those taking the lead to determine the wise course to take. Besides trust in Jehovah and obedience to his commands, what other qualities will help us to prepare for the great tribulation and to act wisely during that earthshaking period?
SHOW BROTHERLY LOVE AND HOSPITALITY
14. According to Hebrews 13:1-3, what qualities did Christians need to show during the last days of the Jewish system of things?

Your answer


14 When the great tribulation strikes, we will need to show love to one another as never before. In this regard, we will need to follow the example of those Christians living in Jerusalem and Judea. They had always shown love to one another. (Heb. 10:32-34) But in the years leading up to the end of the Jewish system of things, Christians had to show “brotherly love” and “hospitality” to an even greater degree.c (Read Hebrews 13:1-3.) The same will be true for us as this system of things comes to an end.
15. Why did the Hebrew Christians need to show brotherly love and hospitality after they fled?

Your answer


15 When the Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem and then suddenly withdrew, Christians fled with relatively few belongings. (Matt. 24:17, 18) They had to depend on one another as they traveled to the mountains and as they settled in their new home. There were doubtless many “cases of urgent need,” and these would give Christians the opportunity to show genuine brotherly love and hospitality by supporting one another and sharing what they had.​—Titus 3:14.
16. How can we show love for fellow worshippers who need our help? (See also picture.)

Your answer


16 Lesson for us: Love motivates us to support fellow worshippers when they need our help. Many of God’s people have been willing to care for the spiritual and material needs of their brothers and sisters who have become refugees because of recent wars and natural disasters. A Ukrainian sister who left her home because of war said: “We have felt Jehovah’s hand guiding us and helping us by means of our brothers. They have welcomed us and helped us so well in Ukraine, in Hungary, and now here in Germany.” Those who show hospitality to their brothers and sisters and care for their needs are tools in Jehovah’s hands.​—Prov. 19:17; 2 Cor. 1:3, 4.




Christian refugees today need our support (See paragraph 16)




17. Why is it vital to cultivate brotherly love and hospitality now?

Your answer


17 No doubt the need for such assistance will be far greater in the future than it is today. (Hab. 3:16-18) Jehovah is training us now to cultivate brotherly love and hospitality, qualities that will be absolutely vital at that time.
WHAT LIES AHEAD
18. How may we imitate the first-century Hebrew Christians?

Your answer


18 As history confirms, the Christians who fled to the mountains were able to avoid the disaster that came upon Jerusalem. They abandoned the city, but Jehovah never abandoned them. What about our day? We do not know exactly how future events will unfold. We do have Jesus’ warning to be ready to act. (Luke 12:40) We also have the admonition that Paul provided in his letter to the Hebrews, counsel that is just as applicable in our day as it was in the first century. And we have Jehovah’s personal guarantee that he will never leave us or abandon us. (Heb. 13:5, 6) May we earnestly seek the city that will remain​—God’s Kingdom—​and enjoy the everlasting blessings that it will bring.​—Matt. 25:34.

SONG 157 Peace at Last!

a In Bible times, cities were often ruled over by a king. This kind of city could be considered a kingdom.​—Gen. 14:2.
b This occurred in 67 C.E., not long after Christians fled from Judea and Jerusalem.
c The word translated “brotherly love” could refer to love for close relatives, but Paul uses it to refer to the close bond of love within the congregation.
