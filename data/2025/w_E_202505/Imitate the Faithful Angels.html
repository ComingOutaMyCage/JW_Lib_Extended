<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN Jehovah drew you to the truth, he invited you into a diverse and loving family of worshippers, which includes millions of faithful angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:9-27:7:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 7:9, 10</a>) As we think of angels, we may reflect on how different they are from us. For example, the angels have existed far longer than we have been alive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7</a>) They are more powerful than we are.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> However, despite these differences, we have a lot in common with the angels. For example, like the angels, we can reflect Jehovah’s fine qualities. We have free will, as do the angels. Much like them, we have personal names and distinct personalities as well as various responsibilities. And, similar to the angels, we have a need to worship our Creator.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:12-60:1:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Consider one event that illustrates the angels’ humility. In about 96 C.E., an unnamed angel delivered an awe-inspiring vision to the apostle John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1</a>) How did John react to the vision? He tried to worship the angel. However, that loyal spirit creature quickly stopped him, saying: “Be careful! Do not do that! I am only a fellow slave of you and of your brothers . . . Worship God!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:10-66:19:10" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10</a>) What a humble response! The angel was not interested in glory or admiration. He immediately turned John’s attention to Jehovah God. At the same time, the angel did not look down on John. Although the angel had served Jehovah for much longer and was much more powerful than John, he humbly referred to the apostle as his fellow slave. And even though the angel had to correct John, he did not scold him or treat the elderly apostle harshly. Instead, the angel spoke kindly. He likely recognized that John was filled with awe.</p>

The woman viewed the girl’s phone call as an answer to her prayers and welcomed a Bible study. Soon thereafter, she started attending meetings.</p>

<li><p id="p73" data-pid="73">  A woman in Romania studied for a time but then stopped. Later, while working as a caregiver in Italy, she wanted to resume her study. Not knowing any local Witnesses, she prayed to Jehovah for help. Shortly thereafter, the family she worked for asked her to go to a store for them. They advised her not to engage the owner in conversation. “He is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” they said, “and he talks to his customers about the Bible.” Sure enough, the brother witnessed to the lady, who saw this as an answer to her prayers. She resumed her study and made fine spiritual progress. Impressed by her example, one of her sons also began studying the Bible and attending Christian meetings.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p74" data-pid="74">  A Witness couple decided to sell their car. When a man and his wife came over to look at the car, the Witnesses took the opportunity to explain that they were simplifying their lives and then talked about our Bible educational work. The husband of the couple interested in the car responded: “Yesterday I prayed: ‘Please, God, put someone on my path who can help me. I feel empty, and I need to find the truth.’” He viewed this chance meeting as an answer to his prayer. He and his wife accepted a Bible study, and their two young daughters also started studying. The family now attends Christian meetings.</p>

After pioneering for some 20 years, Sara became ill and was permanently bedridden. Understandably, she was deeply depressed. But with loving support from her spiritual family along with regular Bible reading, Sara gradually regained a positive outlook. Of course, she had to adapt her ministry to her new circumstances. Since she could not even sit up to write letters, her ministry was limited to witnessing by telephone. So she telephoned her return visits, and they referred her to others who might be interested. The result? Within months, Sara had 70 Bible studies​—far more than she could manage! So she turned some over to others in the congregation. Many of the students now attend our meetings. How happy the angels must be to work alongside brothers and sisters, such as Sara, who do all they can in the preaching work!</p>
