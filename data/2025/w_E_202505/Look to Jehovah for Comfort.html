<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IMAGINE how the Jewish exiles in Babylon must have felt. They had seen their homeland destroyed. Because of their sins and those of their forefathers, they had been taken from their homes and sent to a foreign land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:15-14:36:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:15, 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:36:20-14:36:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) Granted, in Babylon the exiles had some freedom to carry out their daily affairs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:4-24:29:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 29:4-7</a>) Yet, life was not easy, and it definitely was not the life they would have chosen. How did they feel about their situation? Note the words of one faithful exile: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat. We wept when we remembered Zion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:137:1-19:137:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 137:1</a>) The downhearted exiles needed comfort, but where could they find it?</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jehovah is “the God of all comfort.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>) As a loving God, he takes pleasure in comforting all who draw close to him. Jehovah knew that some of the exiles would accept his discipline and return to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:20-23:59:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 59:20</a>) So more than 100 years before the exile, he inspired the prophet Isaiah to write the book that bears his name. For what purpose? Isaiah states: “‘Comfort, comfort my people,’ says your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:1-23:40:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 40:1</a>) Yes, by means of the prophet’s writings, Jehovah provided the comfort that the Jewish exiles would need.</p>

Today we have even more reason than the captive Jews did to appreciate this fact. How so? We understand the basis for Jehovah’s forgiveness. Hundreds of years after Isaiah prophesied, Jehovah sent his beloved Son to earth to provide a ransom for all repentant sinners. That sacrifice provides the basis for sins to be “blotted out”​—completely erased.

Some of us may continue to feel guilty for a past mistake even after we have repented. That may especially be the case if we are still suffering the consequences of our mistake. Yet, if we have confessed our sins and corrected our course, we can <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>be sure that Jehovah has forgiven us. And when Jehovah forgives, he chooses not to remember our sin. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:34-24:31:34" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:34</a>.) So if Jehovah does not dwell on our past sins, neither should we. What counts with Jehovah is what we are doing now, not what mistakes we made in the past. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:14-26:33:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:14-16</a>) And soon, our Father of tender mercies will permanently free us from the consequences of our mistakes.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> What should we do if we are afflicted by a guilty conscience because of hiding a serious sin? The Bible encourages us to ask the elders for help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>) However, we may not find it easy to admit our wrongdoing. But we will be moved to approach those faithful men if we are repentant and if we remember that Jehovah and the men he has appointed to help us will lovingly show mercy. Consider how Jehovah’s mercy comforted a brother named Arthur,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> whose conscience was deeply troubled. “For about a year, I viewed pornography,” said Arthur. “But after hearing a talk about the conscience, I confessed my sin to my wife and to the elders. After that, I finally felt relief, but I was still weighed down by what I had done. The elders reminded me that Jehovah had not rejected me. He disciplines us because he loves us. Their kind words reached my heart and helped me to reset my thinking.” Today, Arthur serves as a pioneer and a ministerial servant. How comforting it is to know that Jehovah shows us mercy if we are repentant!</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[64]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Jehovah also prepared his people for what lay ahead. In an earlier part of the book of Isaiah, God told the nation: “Enter your inner rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>for a brief moment until the wrath has passed by.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:20-23:26:20" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 26:20</a>) This passage may have had an initial fulfillment when Babylon was conquered by King Cyrus. An ancient Greek historian says that when Cyrus entered Babylon, he “gave [his soldiers] orders to cut down all whom they found out of doors.” Imagine how scared the inhabitants of Babylon would have felt! But the Jewish exiles may well have been spared because they obeyed Jehovah’s instructions.</p>

When it begins, people in general will be confused and terrified. But not Jehovah’s people. We know that Jehovah is <strong><em>our</em></strong> God. We will stand erect, knowing that “[our] deliverance is getting near.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Luke 21:28</a>) Even when a coalition of nations attacks us, we will stand firm. Jehovah will give us both angelic protection and lifesaving instructions. How will those instructions be conveyed to us? We will have to wait and see. However, we will likely receive such instructions through our congregations. In a sense, these may be our “inner rooms,” where we will find safety. How can we prepare for what lies ahead? We must draw close to our brothers and sisters, willingly obey theocratic direction, and be convinced that Jehovah is leading our organization.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 13:17</a>.</p>
