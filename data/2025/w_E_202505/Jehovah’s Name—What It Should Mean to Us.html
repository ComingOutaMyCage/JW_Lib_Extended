As the preceding article showed, Jesus was willing to die for Jehovah’s name and all it represents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:36-41:14:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 14:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:7-58:10:9" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:7-9</a>) And after his Thousand Year Reign, Jesus will be willing to give up all authority for the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:26-28</a>) Jesus’ love for God’s name also reveals a lot about his relationship with his Father. It proves beyond any doubt that Jesus loves the Person represented by that name.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus came to the earth in the name of his Father.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:25-43:10:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 10:25</a>) In fact, Jesus asked Jehovah to watch over his disciples “on account of [His] own name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:11-43:17:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:11</a>) So, then, if Jesus felt that strongly about Jehovah’s name, how can someone claim to be a genuine follower of Christ and not know or use the name of his Father?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) But Jesus said: “You will be witnesses of <strong><em>me.”</em></strong> Would these new disciples need to know the name of Jehovah, or were they only going to be witnesses of Jesus?

At the conclusion of the discussion, James, the half brother of Jesus, made this statement: “[Peter] has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them <strong><em>a people for his name.”</em></strong> Whose name was James referring to? Quoting the prophet Amos, he added: “So that the men who remain may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people <strong><em>who are called by my name, says Jehovah.”</em></strong> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:14-44:15:18" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 15:14-18</a>) Not only would these new disciples learn about Jehovah but they would also be ‘called by his name.’ This meant that they would bear God’s name and that they would also be identified by it.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28</a>) By paying the ransom, he made it possible for mankind to be saved and to gain everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>

Because of what happened in the garden of Eden. As mentioned in the preceding article, mankind’s original parents, Adam and Eve, rebelled against Jehovah and thereby lost the opportunity to live forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 3:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:24-1:3:24" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 24</a>) However, something even more important than the salvation of sinful mankind was involved.
