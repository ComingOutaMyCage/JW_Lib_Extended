<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[45]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IT WAS late Thursday evening, Nisan 14, 33 C.E., and Jesus was about to be betrayed, judged, condemned, tortured, and executed. He had just finished having a special meal in an upper room with his faithful apostles. Following that meal, Jesus gave his apostles some parting words of encouragement. And shortly before they all left that upper room, Jesus paused and offered a very meaningful prayer. The apostle John recorded that prayer; it is found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:1-43:17:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John chapter 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> What does Jesus’ prayer reveal to us about his concerns at that time?

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In his prayer, Jesus said: “I have made your name known to them.” In fact, he twice mentioned that he had made Jehovah’s name known to his disciples. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:6-43:17:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>John 17:6,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> <strong>26</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> What did he mean? Had he revealed to them a name that they did not know? Jesus’ disciples were Jews, so they already knew God’s name, Jehovah. That name appeared thousands of times in the Hebrew Scriptures. So Jesus was not referring to the personal name of God; rather, he was referring to what that name <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>represented. Jesus had made known the Person behind Jehovah’s name, including His purposes, activities, and qualities, in a way that no one else ever could.</p>

Does that brother’s name now take on more meaning for you? Of course it does! David is no longer just the elder you know; he is also the surgeon who saved your life.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[49]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> In a similar way, Jesus’ disciples already knew Jehovah’s name. But that name took on greater meaning for them as a result of Jesus’ ministry. Why can we say that? Because Jesus reflected the personality of his Father in everything he said and did. So his apostles came to “know” Jehovah better by listening to the way Jesus taught and by observing the way he dealt with people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 17:3</a>.</p>

No. Notice that in his prayer Jesus refers to the name Jehovah as “your own name.” So Jehovah’s name did not become Jesus’ personal name. What, then, did Jesus mean when he said that God’s name had been given to him? First of all, Jesus was Jehovah’s representative and Spokesman. He came in his Father’s name and performed powerful works in that name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:43-43:5:43" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 5:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:25-43:10:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10:25</a>) Additionally, the name Jesus means “Jehovah Is Salvation.” Yes, the divine name was closely associated with Jesus’ name.</p>

No wonder Jehovah’s name was closely connected to everything that Jesus did while on earth!

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>) Satan also implied that Jehovah’s way of doing things was not right. Satan’s false charges directly attacked Jehovah’s reputation, or name. Later, in the days of Job, Satan claimed that those who serve Jehovah do so only because of what they can get from Him. That slanderer further charged that no human truly loves Jehovah enough to keep serving Him while under trial.

At that point, something very special will happen. The debate that involves the sanctification of Jehovah’s name will end. How? In the garden of Eden, Satan claimed that Jehovah is a liar and that He does not rule mankind out of love. Since that time, his name has been sanctified over and over again by those who honor and respect him. So at the end of the Thousand Year Reign, Jehovah’s reputation will be fully vindicated. He will have proved beyond all doubt that he is a loving heavenly Father.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[71]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Satan’s claims will finally be proved false once for all time. What will Jesus do when the time comes for him to finish ruling? Will he follow the example of Satan and rebel against Jehovah? No! <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:24" data-bid="27-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:24,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:28-46:15:28" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> <strong>28</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jesus will hand the Kingdom back to his Father. He will submit to Jehovah’s rule. Yes, unlike Satan, Jesus is willing to give up everything because of his love for Jehovah.</p>

Jesus has proved to be a perfect representative of his Father. So, what does Jehovah’s name mean to Jesus? It means everything to him. He was willing to die for that name, and he will be willing to hand everything back to Jehovah at the end of the Thousand Year Reign. How can we imitate Jesus’ example? We will discuss the answer to that question in the next article.</p>
