Jehovah’s Name​—What It Means to Jesus


“I have made your name known to them and will make it known.”​—JOHN 17:26.


FOCUS
How Jesus made Jehovah’s name known and how he has sanctified and vindicated that name.


1-2. (a) What did Jesus do on the night before he was put to death? (b) What questions will be considered in this article?

Your answers


IT WAS late Thursday evening, Nisan 14, 33 C.E., and Jesus was about to be betrayed, judged, condemned, tortured, and executed. He had just finished having a special meal in an upper room with his faithful apostles. Following that meal, Jesus gave his apostles some parting words of encouragement. And shortly before they all left that upper room, Jesus paused and offered a very meaningful prayer. The apostle John recorded that prayer; it is found in John chapter 17.
2 What does Jesus’ prayer reveal to us about his concerns at that time? How does that prayer show what was important to him during his entire ministry while here on earth? Let us discuss the answers to these questions.
“I HAVE MADE YOUR NAME KNOWN TO THEM”
 3. What did Jesus say about Jehovah’s name, and what did he mean? (John 17:6, 26)

Your answer


3 In his prayer, Jesus said: “I have made your name known to them.” In fact, he twice mentioned that he had made Jehovah’s name known to his disciples. (Read John 17:6, 26.) What did he mean? Had he revealed to them a name that they did not know? Jesus’ disciples were Jews, so they already knew God’s name, Jehovah. That name appeared thousands of times in the Hebrew Scriptures. So Jesus was not referring to the personal name of God; rather, he was referring to what that name represented. Jesus had made known the Person behind Jehovah’s name, including His purposes, activities, and qualities, in a way that no one else ever could.
4-5. (a) How might we illustrate what it means to come to know a person’s name? (b) In what way did Jesus’ disciples come to know Jehovah’s name?

Your answers


4 To illustrate, imagine that there is an elder in your congregation named David and he is also a surgeon. You have known that brother for many years. But then one day you have a medical emergency. You are rushed to the hospital where that brother works, and he uses his medical skill to save your life. Does that brother’s name now take on more meaning for you? Of course it does! David is no longer just the elder you know; he is also the surgeon who saved your life.
5 In a similar way, Jesus’ disciples already knew Jehovah’s name. But that name took on greater meaning for them as a result of Jesus’ ministry. Why can we say that? Because Jesus reflected the personality of his Father in everything he said and did. So his apostles came to “know” Jehovah better by listening to the way Jesus taught and by observing the way he dealt with people.​—John 14:9; 17:3.
“YOUR OWN NAME, WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN ME”
 6. In what sense did Jehovah give Jesus His name? (John 17:11, 12)

Your answer


6 In his prayer, Jesus prayed for his disciples, saying: “Watch over them on account of your own name, which you have given me.” (Read John 17:11, 12.) Does this mean that Jesus would now be known as Jehovah? No. Notice that in his prayer Jesus refers to the name Jehovah as “your own name.” So Jehovah’s name did not become Jesus’ personal name. What, then, did Jesus mean when he said that God’s name had been given to him? First of all, Jesus was Jehovah’s representative and Spokesman. He came in his Father’s name and performed powerful works in that name. (John 5:43; 10:25) Additionally, the name Jesus means “Jehovah Is Salvation.” Yes, the divine name was closely associated with Jesus’ name.
 7. Illustrate how Jesus could speak in Jehovah’s name.

Your answer


7 To illustrate, because an ambassador represents a ruler, he may speak in the name of the ruler. So the ambassador’s words have the same authority as those of the ruler. Similarly, Jesus represented Jehovah and spoke to the people in His name.​—Matt. 21:9; Luke 13:35.
 8. How was Jehovah’s name “in” Jesus prior to his coming to earth? (Exodus 23:20, 21)

Your answer


8 In his role as the Word, Jesus has served as Jehovah’s Spokesman by conveying information and instructions to other spirit sons of God as well as to humans. (John 1:1-3) Jesus was likely the angel whom Jehovah sent to care for the Israelites during the time of the Exodus. When telling the Israelites to obey that angel, Jehovah said: “Because my name is in him.”a (Read Exodus 23:20, 21.) Jehovah’s name was “in” Jesus in that he represents Jehovah and he is the principal one who upholds and sanctifies his Father’s name.
“FATHER, GLORIFY YOUR NAME”
 9. How important was Jehovah’s name to Jesus? Explain.

Your answer


9 As we have just discussed, even before Jesus came to the earth, Jehovah’s name was of the utmost importance to him. No wonder Jehovah’s name was closely connected to everything that Jesus did while on earth! Toward the end of his ministry, Jesus called out: “Father, glorify your name.” Immediately, his Father replied in a thunderous voice from heaven: “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.”​—John 12:28.
10-11. (a) How did Jesus glorify Jehovah’s name? (See also picture.) (b) Why does Jehovah’s name need to be sanctified and vindicated?

Your answers


10 Jesus too glorified his Father’s name. How so? One way was by revealing his Father’s amazing qualities and actions to others. Yet, more was involved in glorifying that name. Jehovah’s name needed to be sanctified and his reputation vindicated.b Jesus showed how important this was when he taught his followers the model prayer. He said: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”​—Matt. 6:9.
11 Why does Jehovah’s name need to be sanctified and vindicated? Because back in the garden of Eden, Satan the Devil dishonored and slandered Jehovah God. Satan claimed that Jehovah was a liar and that He was withholding something good from Adam and Eve. (Gen. 3:1-5) Satan also implied that Jehovah’s way of doing things was not right. Satan’s false charges directly attacked Jehovah’s reputation, or name. Later, in the days of Job, Satan claimed that those who serve Jehovah do so only because of what they can get from Him. That slanderer further charged that no human truly loves Jehovah enough to keep serving Him while under trial. (Job 1:9-11; 2:4) Time was needed in order to prove who was the liar, Jehovah or Satan.




Jesus taught his followers the importance of sanctifying God’s name (See paragraph 10)




“I SURRENDER MY LIFE”
12. What was Jesus willing to do because of his love for Jehovah’s name?

Your answer


12 Because of his love for Jehovah, Jesus wanted to do all he could to sanctify and vindicate Jehovah’s name. “I surrender my life,” Jesus said. (John 10:17, 18) Yes, he was even willing to die for Jehovah’s name.c The first two perfect humans, Adam and Eve, turned their back on Jehovah and sided with Satan. In contrast, Jesus was willing to come to the earth and prove his love for Jehovah. Jesus did this by living a life of perfect integrity. (Heb. 4:15; 5:7-10) He maintained his integrity during his life, right down to his death on a torture stake. (Heb. 12:2) In this way, he proved his love for Jehovah and His name.
13. Why was Jesus in a unique position to prove Satan a liar? (See also picture.)

Your answer


13 By his life course, Jesus proved beyond any doubt that Satan is the liar, not Jehovah! (John 8:44) Jesus knew Jehovah better than anyone else who had ever lived. If there was any truth to Satan’s accusations against Jehovah, Jesus would have known about it. But Jesus remained firm in defending Jehovah’s reputation, or name. Even when it appeared that Jehovah had abandoned him, Jesus was willing to die rather than turn his back on his loving Father.​—Matt. 27:46.d




Jesus’ life course proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Satan is the liar, not Jehovah! (See paragraph 13)




“I HAVE . . . FINISHED THE WORK YOU HAVE GIVEN ME”
14. How did Jehovah reward Jesus’ faithfulness?

Your answer


14 In the prayer he offered the night before he died, Jesus could say: “I have . . . finished the work you have given me to do.” He trusted that Jehovah would reward him for his faithfulness. (John 17:4, 5) Jesus’ trust in his Father was not misplaced. Jehovah did not allow him to remain in the grave. (Acts 2:23, 24) He resurrected Jesus and gave him a superior position in heaven. (Phil. 2:8, 9) Eventually, Jesus began ruling as King of God’s Kingdom. What would that Kingdom accomplish? The second part of the model prayer tells us: “Let your Kingdom come. Let your [Jehovah’s] will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.”​—Matt. 6:10.
15. What else will Jesus accomplish?

Your answer


15 In the near future, Jesus will wage war against God’s enemies and destroy the wicked at Armageddon. (Rev. 16:14, 16; 19:11-16) Shortly thereafter, he will throw Satan into “the abyss,” a state of deathlike inactivity. (Rev. 20:1-3) Jesus will restore peace and perfection to mankind during his Thousand Year Reign. He will resurrect the dead. He will make the whole earth a paradise. Jehovah’s purpose will be accomplished!​—Rev. 21:1-4.
16. What will be accomplished by the end of the Thousand Year Reign?

Your answer


16 What can we expect to happen by the end of the Thousand Year Reign? Human sin and imperfection will be gone. Mankind will no longer need to ask for forgiveness of their sins on the basis of the ransom; neither will they need a mediator or a priesthood. And “the last enemy, [Adamic] death, [will have been] brought to nothing.” The graves will be empty. The dead will have been brought back to life. Everyone on earth will be perfect.​—1 Cor. 15:25, 26.
17-18. (a) What happens at the end of the Thousand Year Reign? (b) What will Jesus do when the time comes for him to finish ruling? (1 Corinthians 15:24, 28) (See also picture.)

Your answers


17 What else happens at the end of the Thousand Year Reign? At that point, something very special will happen. The debate that involves the sanctification of Jehovah’s name will end. How? In the garden of Eden, Satan claimed that Jehovah is a liar and that He does not rule mankind out of love. Since that time, his name has been sanctified over and over again by those who honor and respect him. So at the end of the Thousand Year Reign, Jehovah’s reputation will be fully vindicated. He will have proved beyond all doubt that he is a loving heavenly Father.
18 Satan’s claims will finally be proved false once for all time. What will Jesus do when the time comes for him to finish ruling? Will he follow the example of Satan and rebel against Jehovah? No! (Read 1 Corinthians 15:24, 28.) Jesus will hand the Kingdom back to his Father. He will submit to Jehovah’s rule. Yes, unlike Satan, Jesus is willing to give up everything because of his love for Jehovah.




Jesus willingly hands the Kingdom back to Jehovah at the end of his Thousand Year Reign (See paragraph 18)




19. What does Jehovah’s name mean to Jesus?

Your answer


19 No wonder Jehovah was willing to give Jesus His name! Jesus has proved to be a perfect representative of his Father. So, what does Jehovah’s name mean to Jesus? It means everything to him. He was willing to die for that name, and he will be willing to hand everything back to Jehovah at the end of the Thousand Year Reign. How can we imitate Jesus’ example? We will discuss the answer to that question in the next article.

SONG 16 Praise Jah for His Son, the Anointed

a At times, angels have also represented Jehovah when they delivered messages in his name. That is why there are instances in the Bible where an angel is addressed or referred to as if he were Jehovah himself. (Gen. 18:1-33) Although the Scriptures say that Moses received the Law from Jehovah, other verses reveal that Jehovah used angels to transmit that Law in His name.​—Lev. 27:34; Acts 7:38, 53; Gal. 3:19; Heb. 2:2-4.
b EXPRESSIONS EXPLAINED: To “sanctify” means to honor, to consider holy, or to hold in reverence. To “vindicate” means to free someone’s reputation from false accusations or to exonerate that person or to prove that he is innocent of false charges or slander.
c Jesus’ death also provided the way for mankind to gain everlasting life.
