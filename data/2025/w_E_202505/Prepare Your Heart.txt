STUDY TIP
Prepare Your Heart




When we study the Bible, we want Jehovah’s thoughts to affect our heart, or inner person. Ezra set a fine example in this regard when he “prepared his heart to consult the Law of Jehovah.” (Ezra 7:10) How can we prepare our heart?
Pray. Begin each study session with a prayer. Ask Jehovah to help you understand and apply what you learn.​—Ps. 119:18, 34.
Cultivate humility. God hides the truth from those who proudly rely on their own intellect. (Luke 10:21) Avoid doing research to try to impress others. Humbly change your thinking when it does not harmonize with God’s.
Try listening to a Kingdom song. Music has the power to speak to our heart, preparing us for worship. Listening to a Kingdom song at the start of a study session may help you to prepare your heart.
