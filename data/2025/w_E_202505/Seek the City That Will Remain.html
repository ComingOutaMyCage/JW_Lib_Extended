In that letter, Paul gave Christians in Judea and Jerusalem vital counsel that would help them prepare for what lay ahead. And what exactly lay ahead? Jerusalem was going to be destroyed. If those Christians hoped to survive, they would have to be ready to abandon their homes and businesses. So regarding the city of Jerusalem, Paul wrote: “We do not have here a city that remains.” Then he added: “But we are earnestly seeking the one to come.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:14-58:13:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 13:14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:13-58:8:13" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 8:13</a>) Most of the city’s inhabitants had rejected the Messiah.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[52]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> When Paul wrote to the Hebrews, Jerusalem was a thriving city. A Roman author of that era called Jerusalem “by far the most famous city of the East.” Jews from many lands traveled there yearly to observe the festivals, which contributed to a thriving economy. No doubt some Christians also benefited from this favorable economic situation. Perhaps that is why Paul told them: “Let your way of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things.” He then quoted a powerful assurance found in the Scriptures, expressing Jehovah’s personal guarantee: “I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 13:5, 6;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:6-5:31:6" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Deut. 31:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:6-19:118:6" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Ps. 118:6</a>) Christians living in Jerusalem and Judea would need this assurance. Why? Because shortly after receiving this letter, they would be obliged to leave behind their homes, their businesses, and most of their belongings. Then they would have to face what lay ahead of them.</p>

They abandoned the city, but Jehovah never abandoned them. What about our day? We do not know exactly how future events will unfold. We do have Jesus’ warning to be ready to act. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:40-42:12:40" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 12:40</a>) We also have the admonition that Paul provided in his letter to the Hebrews, counsel that is just as applicable in our day as it was in the first century. And we have Jehovah’s personal guarantee that he will never leave us or abandon us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 13:5, 6</a>) May we earnestly seek the city that will remain​—God’s Kingdom—​and enjoy the everlasting blessings that it will bring.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:34" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 25:34</a>.</p>
