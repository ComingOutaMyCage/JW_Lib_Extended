SONG 2 Jehovah Is Your Name

Jehovah’s Name​—What It Should Mean to Us


“‘You are my witnesses,’ declares Jehovah.”​—ISA. 43:10.


FOCUS
To show our role in the sanctification and vindication of Jehovah’s name.


1-2. How do we know that Jehovah’s name is important to Jesus?

Your answer


JEHOVAH’S name is of utmost importance to Jesus. He is the principal one who upholds his Father’s name. As the preceding article showed, Jesus was willing to die for Jehovah’s name and all it represents. (Mark 14:36; Heb. 10:7-9) And after his Thousand Year Reign, Jesus will be willing to give up all authority for the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (1 Cor. 15:26-28) Jesus’ love for God’s name also reveals a lot about his relationship with his Father. It proves beyond any doubt that Jesus loves the Person represented by that name.
2 Jesus came to the earth in the name of his Father. (John 5:43; 12:13) He made known his Father’s name to his followers. (John 17:6, 26) He taught in Jehovah’s name and performed miracles in that name. (John 10:25) In fact, Jesus asked Jehovah to watch over his disciples “on account of [His] own name.” (John 17:11) So, then, if Jesus felt that strongly about Jehovah’s name, how can someone claim to be a genuine follower of Christ and not know or use the name of his Father?
 3. What will we discuss in this article?

Your answer


3 As Christians, who try to follow in Jesus’ footsteps, we treasure the name of his Father. (1 Pet. 2:21) In this article, we will see how Jehovah’s name identifies those who are proclaiming the “good news of the Kingdom.” (Matt. 24:14) We will also discuss what the name of Jehovah should mean to us personally.
“A PEOPLE FOR HIS NAME”
 4. (a) What commission did Jesus give his disciples before he returned to heaven? (b) What question arises because of that commission?

Your answers


4 Just before returning to heaven, Jesus told his disciples: “You will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) So the good news would be preached beyond the borders of Israel. Eventually, people of all the nations would have an opportunity to become followers of Jesus. (Matt. 28:19, 20) But Jesus said: “You will be witnesses of me.” Would these new disciples need to know the name of Jehovah, or were they only going to be witnesses of Jesus? The events described in Acts chapter 15 help us to answer that question.
 5. How did the apostles and older men in Jerusalem show that all people need to know Jehovah’s name? (See also picture.)

Your answer


5 In 49 C.E., the apostles and older men in Jerusalem met together to discuss what uncircumcised Gentiles needed to do in order to be accepted as Christians. At the conclusion of the discussion, James, the half brother of Jesus, made this statement: “[Peter] has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.” Whose name was James referring to? Quoting the prophet Amos, he added: “So that the men who remain may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, people who are called by my name, says Jehovah.” (Acts 15:14-18) Not only would these new disciples learn about Jehovah but they would also be ‘called by his name.’ This meant that they would bear God’s name and that they would also be identified by it.




At a meeting of the first-century governing body, those faithful men clearly discerned that Christians must be a people for God’s name (See paragraph 5)




6-7. (a) Why did Jesus come to the earth? (b) What other more important reason was involved?

Your answers


6 Jesus’ very name means “Jehovah Is Salvation,” and he proved to be Jehovah’s means of saving those who exercise faith. Jesus came to the earth to offer himself in behalf of mankind. (Matt. 20:28) By paying the ransom, he made it possible for mankind to be saved and to gain everlasting life.​—John 3:16.
7 But why did mankind need to be saved in the first place? Because of what happened in the garden of Eden. As mentioned in the preceding article, mankind’s original parents, Adam and Eve, rebelled against Jehovah and thereby lost the opportunity to live forever. (Gen. 3:6, 24) However, something even more important than the salvation of sinful mankind was involved. Jehovah’s name was slandered. (Gen. 3:4, 5) So the salvation of Adam and Eve’s descendants was connected to a greater issue​—the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. Because Jesus represented Jehovah and bore His name, he played a key role in sanctifying Jehovah’s name.
How can someone claim to be a genuine follower of Christ and not know or use the name of his Father?

 8. What would all believers in Jesus need to acknowledge?

Your answer


8 All those who would exercise faith in Jesus, both Jews and Gentiles, would need to acknowledge the Source of their salvation, namely, Jesus’ Father, Jehovah God. (John 17:3) Additionally, like Jesus, they would be identified by Jehovah’s name. They would also need to recognize the importance of the sanctification of that name. Their salvation depended on that. (Acts 2:21, 22) So all faithful followers of Jesus needed to learn about Jehovah as well as Jesus. No wonder Jesus finished his prayer recorded in John 17 with these words: “I have made your name known to them and will make it known, so that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in union with them.”​—John 17:26.
“YOU ARE MY WITNESSES”
 9. How can we show that Jehovah’s name is important to us?

Your answer


9 All genuine followers of Jesus, therefore, need to be interested in the sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Matt. 6:9, 10) They must consider Jehovah’s name to be above all others. This involves action on their part. But how can we have a part in sanctifying Jehovah’s name, or in clearing it of the slander that Satan heaped upon it?
10. What figurative court case is described in chapters 42 to 44 of the book of Isaiah? (Isaiah 43:9; 44:7-9) (See also picture.)

Your answer


10 The importance of our role in sanctifying Jehovah’s name is highlighted in chapters 42 to 44 of the book of Isaiah. Those chapters describe a figurative court case in which the issue of godship is on trial. Jehovah challenges all those who claim to be gods to prove that they really are gods. He also calls for witnesses to come forward and prove the claims of these gods. But no one can!​—Read Isaiah 43:9; 44:7-9.




In many ways, we are involved in a figurative court case (See paragraphs 10-11)




11. What declaration does Jehovah make to his people, as recorded at Isaiah 43:10-12?

Your answer


11 Read Isaiah 43:10-12. Jehovah says regarding his people: “You are my witnesses, . . . and I am God.” Jehovah is asking them to answer this question: “Is there any God but me?” (Isa. 44:8) We, therefore, have the privilege of answering that question. By our words and actions, we testify that Jehovah is the only true God. His name is above all other names. We prove by our life course that we truly love Jehovah and that we are loyal to him​—no matter what pressure Satan brings upon us. In this way, we have an opportunity to help sanctify His name.
12. How was the prophecy found at Isaiah 40:3, 5 fulfilled?

Your answer


12 When we support Jehovah’s name, or reputation, we are imitating Jesus Christ. Isaiah also foretold that a forerunner would “clear up [or, “prepare,” ftn.] the way of Jehovah.” (Isa. 40:3) How was that fulfilled? John the Baptizer prepared the way for Jesus, who came in the name of Jehovah and spoke in the name of Jehovah. (Matt. 3:3; Mark 1:2-4; Luke 3:3-6) The same prophecy said: “The glory of Jehovah will be revealed.” (Isa. 40:5) How was that the case? When Jesus came to the earth, he represented Jehovah so perfectly that it was as if Jehovah himself had come to the earth.​—John 12:45.
13. How can we imitate Jesus?

Your answer


13 Like Jesus, we are witnesses of Jehovah. We bear Jehovah’s name and tell everyone we meet about his marvelous deeds. To do this effectively, though, we must also make known Jesus’ vital role in sanctifying Jehovah’s name. (Acts 1:8) Jesus is the foremost Witness of Jehovah, and we follow his lead. (Rev. 1:5) But what should Jehovah’s name mean for each one of us?
WHAT JEHOVAH’S NAME MEANS FOR US
14. As highlighted at Psalm 105:3, how do we feel about Jehovah’s name?

Your answer


14 We are proud of Jehovah’s name. (Read Psalm 105:3.) Jehovah takes great delight in our boasting about his name. (Jer. 9:23, 24; 1 Cor. 1:31; 2 Cor. 10:17) To “boast in Jehovah” means to take pride in Jehovah as our God. We view it as a privilege to honor his name and support his reputation. We must never be ashamed to tell our workmates, classmates, neighbors, and others that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses! The Devil wants us to stop talking about Jehovah’s name to others. (Jer. 11:21; Rev. 12:17) In fact, Satan and his false prophets want to make people forget the name of Jehovah. (Jer. 23:26, 27) But our love for Jehovah’s name keeps us rejoicing in it “all day long.”​—Ps. 5:11; 89:16.
15. What does it mean to call on Jehovah’s name?

Your answer


15 We continue to call on Jehovah’s name. (Joel 2:32; Rom. 10:13, 14) Calling on Jehovah’s name involves more than just knowing and using God’s personal name. We come to know God as a Person, to trust in him, and to look to him for help and guidance. (Ps. 20:7; 99:6; 116:4; 145:18) We also declare his name and qualities to others, exhorting them to repent and take action so that they can gain Jehovah’s approval.​—Isa. 12:4; Acts 2:21, 38.
16. How can we prove that Satan is a liar?

Your answer


16 We are willing to suffer for Jehovah’s name. (Jas. 5:10, 11) When we remain loyal to Jehovah in the face of suffering, we prove Satan to be a liar. In Job’s day, Satan made this accusation with regard to those who serve Jehovah: “A man will give everything that he has for his life.” (Job 2:4) Satan claimed that people would serve Jehovah only in good times and that they would abandon Jehovah if faced with hardships. Faithful Job proved that accusation false. We likewise have the privilege of proving that no matter what Satan throws at us, we will never turn our back on Jehovah. We can be absolutely confident that Jehovah will keep watch over us on account of his name.​—John 17:11.
17. In what other way can we bring glory to Jehovah’s name, as mentioned at 1 Peter 2:12?

Your answer


17 We show respect for Jehovah’s name. (Prov. 30:9; Jer. 7:8-11) Because we represent Jehovah and bear his name, we can either praise his name or dishonor it. (Read 1 Peter 2:12.) Therefore, we want to do everything we can to praise Jehovah by means of our speech and conduct. In this way, we will bring glory to his name to the best of our imperfect abilities.
18. What is another way that we can prove that Jehovah’s name is important to us? (See also footnote.)

Your answer


18 We are more concerned with Jehovah’s name than with our own reputation. (Ps. 138:2) Why is this so important? Because our love for Jehovah’s name may damage our reputation with those around us.a Jesus was willing to die a shameful death as a convicted criminal in order to honor Jehovah’s name. He ‘despised shame’ in that he was not troubled or overly concerned about what others thought of him. (Heb. 12:2-4) His focus was on doing God’s will.​—Matt. 26:39.
19. How do you feel about Jehovah’s name, and why?

Your answer


19 We are proud of Jehovah’s name and feel honored to be called Jehovah’s Witnesses. Because of that, we are willing to put up with any reproach we may face. Jehovah’s name is more important to us than even our own reputation. So let us be determined to continue praising Jehovah’s name no matter what Satan may hurl at us. In this way, we will prove that Jehovah’s name is of utmost importance to us, just as it is to Jesus Christ.

SONG 10 Praise Jehovah Our God!

a Even the faithful man Job became distracted when his own reputation was attacked by his three companions. Initially, when he lost his children and all his possessions, “Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong.” (Job 1:22; 2:10) However, when Job was accused of wrongdoing, he engaged in “wild talk.” He gave priority to defending his own reputation instead of sanctifying God’s name, or reputation.​—Job 6:3; 13:4, 5; 32:2; 34:5.
