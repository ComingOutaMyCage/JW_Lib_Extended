<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>What is the role of a father?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span><strong>  Before your child is born.</strong> The kind of husband you are <strong>now</strong> indicates the kind of dad you will be <strong>later.</strong> The book <em>Do Fathers Matter?</em> observes:</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>“A father who helps his pregnant partner buy supplies, takes her to doctors’ visits, and sees the fetus on an ultrasound or hears its heartbeat is more likely to be involved with his partner and baby after the birth.”</p>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“I didn’t want my wife to feel that she was going through her pregnancy alone, so I helped her however I could. We even set up the baby’s room together. It was a special time for both of us as we prepared for the baby’s arrival.”—James.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Look out not only for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 2:4</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>After your child is born.</strong> You can create a bond by playing with and holding your infant. Share in caregiving tasks too. Your involvement as a father contributes significantly to your child’s development. The bond that you build shows that you view your child as precious to you.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“Get down to your child’s level. Play. Be goofy. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Remember, a child’s first impression of love comes from you as a parent.”—Richard.</em></p>

</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>  As your child grows.</strong> Research shows that children who are close to their father do better at school, have fewer emotional problems, and are less likely to abuse drugs or get involved in delinquent behavior. Take the time needed to cultivate a good relationship with your child.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“My son told me that what he would miss the most when he moved out was the conversations we had during long drives or at dinnertime. Some of the most important conversations we had came when I least expected it. They came as a result of spending lots of time together.”—Dennis.</em></p>

<h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>How is a father unique?</strong></h2>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Traditionally, fathers have been viewed as material providers and physical protectors of the family, while mothers have been regarded as more sensitive to the family’s emotional needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:31-5:1:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 1:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:15-23:49:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isaiah 49:15</a>) Those roles may overlap—in some families, to a large degree. Nevertheless, researchers say that a dad and a mom each contribute a unique ingredient to the parenting recipe.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>Family researcher Judith Wallerstein relates a personal experience that illustrates the point. She writes: “When my twelve-year-old daughter was hit by a car, she wanted her father to ride in the ambulance because she had greater confidence in his ability to take charge. Later on in the hospital, she wanted me to sit at her bedside all day to comfort her.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<blockquote><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em>“A father brings a measure of stability and protection to the family that a mother may struggle to provide on her own. At the same time, a mother creates a nurturing environment as she listens with empathy. Both work together as a team.”—Daniel.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the instruction of your mother.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:8-20:1:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p24" data-pid="24"><strong>Dads and daughters</strong></h2>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>As a father, you teach your daughter how she deserves to be treated by men. She learns this lesson in the following two ways:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>  By observing how you treat her mother.</strong> When you love and respect your wife, your daughter sees the qualities that are important for her to look for in a spouse later in life.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:7-60:3:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:7</a>.</p>

<li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>  By observing how you treat her.</strong> When you show respect for your daughter, you teach her to respect herself. She also learns to expect that kind of treatment from other men.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>In contrast, persistent criticism damages a girl’s self-worth and can cause her to look to other men for approval—men who do not have her best interests at heart.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><em>“A daughter who has the love and support of her father is not likely to be swept off her feet by a man who doesn’t have the qualities to be a good husband.”—Wayne.</em></p>
