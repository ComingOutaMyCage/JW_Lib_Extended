<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>In one survey, 97 percent of teenagers indicated that they use social media. Is your child eager to join the crowd? If so, there are a few things you should consider.</p>

<h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>Your child’s use of time</strong></h2>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>“Social media platforms are designed to snare your attention, keep you online, and have you repeatedly checking your screen for updates,” says the website HelpGuide.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“Minutes slip into hours as I’m scrolling through countless social media posts. It can be very hard to put down the phone and find something more productive to do.”—Lynne, 20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Will my child have enough self-control to abide by the limits that I set for social media use? Is my child mature enough to set his or her own limits and abide by them?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Keep strict watch that how you walk is . . . as wise persons, making the best use of your time.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15, 16</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Your child’s view of friendship</strong></h2>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The term <em>“social</em> media” suggests that users have friends or are connected to the people they know. Often, though, that connection is superficial.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“I’ve noticed that many young people wrongly think that if they get more likes or followers, that means more people really care about them, even if they don’t really know those people.”—Patricia, 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Does my child have the maturity to avoid placing undue importance on followers and likes? How well can he or she cultivate <strong>off-line</strong> friendships?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “A true friend shows love at all times and is a brother who is born for times of distress.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>Your child’s emotional health</strong></h2>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Researchers have noted that excessive use of social media is associated with feeling lonely, anxious, and even depressed.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><em>“Seeing photos of what your friends are doing with your other friends—without you—is never a great feeling.”—Serena, 19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Will my child have the maturity to avoid becoming self-focused, competitive, or unduly affected by what he or she sees others doing on social media?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Let us not become egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 5:26</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p26" data-pid="26"><strong>Your child’s online behavior</strong></h2>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Social media can open the door to cyberbullying, sexting, and viewing pornography. Even if your child does not initiate these behaviors, he or she could be exposed to them.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>“I notice that content on social media seems to go south easily. There is a lot of strong language and inappropriate music.”—Linda, 23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><strong>Ask yourself:</strong> Does my child have the maturity to be a good digital citizen? Will my child have the moral strength to turn away from inappropriate material?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Let sexual immorality and every sort of uncleanness or greediness not even be mentioned among you, . . . neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:3-49:5:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3, 4</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p31" data-pid="31"><strong>Is social media necessary?</strong></h2>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Social media is not essential for life, not even for a comfortable, happy life. Many young ones are content to live without social media—including some who once used it but then decided to quit.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><em>“After seeing how my sister was negatively affected by her use of social media, I decided to quit using it. Ever since then, I’ve been happier and I feel that I’m getting more out of life.”—Nathan, 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Before allowing your child to use social media, make sure he or she is mature enough to stick to time limits, maintain healthy friendships, and avoid inappropriate content.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “The shrewd one ponders each step.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38">“People often ‘put their best foot forward’ on social media. They make it seem as if they had a problem-free and blissful life, and this can make friendship rather superficial. We meet this challenge by maintaining communication that is more private—phone calls, texts, and emails, for example—with those who are closest to us.”—Alan, with his wife, Brenna, and their daughter, Emma.</p>
