<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>What is jealousy?</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>The word “jealousy” has different shades of meaning. In this article, it refers to the emotion we feel when we believe that someone is taking an improper interest in our marriage mate or that our marriage mate is taking an improper interest in someone else. We may feel that our marriage is under threat. If that really is the case, then jealousy is normal and proper. After all, marriage is the closest bond between two humans, and a couple should do all in their power to protect it.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “They are no longer two, but one flesh. . . . What God has yoked together, let no man put apart.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:6-40:19:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 19:6</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><em>“If there’s a threat to your marriage, jealousy can be like a smoke detector that alerts you to the danger and impels you to take action.”—Benjamin.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Unwarranted jealousy,</strong> however, is motivated by suspicion and fear that have no foundation. Genuine love protects us from such hurtful jealousy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:7-46:13:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Dr. Robert L. Leahy writes: “The actions that result [from unfounded jealousy] can jeopardize the very relationship that you want to protect.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>What causes undue jealousy?</strong></h2>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>You might be prone to undue jealousy if you were betrayed in the past by a former spouse. Or perhaps your parents’ marriage failed because of unfaithfulness and you fear that the same will happen to yours.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><em>“My dad cheated on my mom when I was young, so distrust has always been a problem for me. It’s an emotional scar that occasionally rears its ugly head in my marriage.”—Melissa.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Another factor: If you tend to be insecure, you might be quick to view others as a threat to your marriage. You could even convince yourself that, given the chance, your spouse would leave you for someone else.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>“My husband was asked to be a groomsman at his friend’s wedding, which meant that at certain times he would be paired with a bridesmaid. I was not OK with that. He had to say no.”—Naomi.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Wedding customs vary, and Christians must be guided by Bible principles. Was Naomi being reasonable on that occasion? In hindsight, she acknowledges that her jealousy was unfounded. “I felt insecure at the time,” she says. “I thought that my husband compared me with other women, but it was all in my head.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Whatever the cause, improper jealousy can move you to suspect and even unjustly accuse your mate of unfaithfulness. The resulting climate of distrust will harm your marriage and possibly even your health.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Jealousy is like a cancer.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:30-20:14:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:30</a>, <em>Easy-to-Read Version.</em></p>
<h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>How can you control your jealousy?</strong></h2>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Build your trust.</strong> Rather than look for signs of disloyalty, think of ways that your spouse has earned your trust.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em>“I think of my husband’s good qualities. If he’s attentive toward someone, it’s because he genuinely cares, not because he has improper motives. I have to remind myself that my parents’ marriage is not my marriage.”—Melissa.</em></p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p37" data-pid="37">Do not hastily dismiss your spouse’s feelings. Instead, try to help him or her determine the cause.

Such understanding is especially important if a spouse has been betrayed in the past and struggles with feelings of insecurity.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38">Take an honest look at yourself too. Is your conduct with members of the opposite sex appropriate, whether in person or online? Or do you tend to be flirtatious? What would your spouse say? Be determined not to give him or her any reason to doubt your loyalty and love.</p>
