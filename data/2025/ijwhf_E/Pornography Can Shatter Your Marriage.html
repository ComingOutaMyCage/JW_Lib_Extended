<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>Pornography can shatter a marriage. It promotes resentment and fosters mistrust on the part of the innocent mate.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>A wife whose husband looks at pornography may experience the following feelings:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>Betrayal.</strong> A wife named Sarah says, “It’s as if my husband had committed adultery again and again.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Inadequacy.</strong> One wife says that her husband’s pornography habit left her feeling “ugly and ashamed.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Mistrust.</strong> “I am suspicious of my husband’s every move,” says a wife named Helen.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>Anxiety.</strong> A wife named Catherine admits, “Worrying about my husband’s habit consumed my life.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> The Bible tells a husband to love his wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:25-49:5:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25</a>) Is he doing that if he subjects her to the effects listed above?</p>
<h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The practice of viewing pornography is not easy to quit. “My husband gave up cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol,” says a wife named Stacey, “but he still struggles with pornography.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>If you are in that situation, the following suggestions can help you to quit the habit once and for all.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  <strong>Understand why pornography is bad.</strong> Pornography promotes selfish gratification, which undermines the love, trust, and loyalty that are necessary for a happy marriage. It also shows disrespect for the Creator of marriage, Jehovah God.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Let marriage be honorable.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  <strong>Take responsibility for your actions.</strong> Do not say, ‘I wouldn’t need pornography if my wife were more affectionate.’ Shifting the blame to your wife is unfair, and it merely gives you a convenient excuse to relapse when she disappoints you.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by <strong>his own</strong> desire.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:14</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  <strong>Be open and honest with your spouse.</strong> A husband named Kevin says: “I check in with my wife daily. Did I give a second glance to something provocative, or did I avoid it? This constant communication removes all secrecy.”</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “We wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>  <strong>Remain vigilant.</strong> A relapse can occur even after years of supposedly conquering the habit. Kevin, quoted earlier, says: “I resisted pornography for ten years and convinced myself that my problem was over. But the addiction was lying dormant, waiting for the right circumstances to rear its ugly head.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Let the one who thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:12-46:10:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>  <strong>When you are tempted, wait.</strong> While you may not be able to prevent the craving, you <strong>can</strong> choose whether or not you will act on it. The desire will pass—perhaps even faster if you learn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:2014245/">redirect your thinking</a> to other activities.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not with greedy, uncontrolled sexual passion.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:4-52:4:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:4, 5</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>  <strong>Avoid circumstances that might trigger a relapse.</strong> “Once you’re in a vulnerable situation,” says the book <em>Willpower’s Not Enough,</em> “you’ve lit a match. All it takes is a little fuel . . . to light the fire.”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “May nothing wicked dominate me.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:133-19:119:133" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 119:133</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>  <strong>Do not lose hope.</strong> It can take a long time—even years—to restore your mate’s trust. But experience shows that it is possible.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Love is patient.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>.</p>

<div id="footnote2" data-fnid="2" class="fn-ref"><p id="p36" data-pid="36"><a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> Some married couples claim that viewing pornography together can enhance their relationship.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40">Can you help your husband regain your trust? Perhaps​ you can—especially if he is making a genuine effort to quit.
