<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>What you can explain.</strong> There is wonderful variety in the physical features and cultural customs of humans throughout the world. This diversity has led some people to treat other people badly based on how they look or act.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>However, the Bible teaches that all humans share a common ancestry. In other words, we are all related to one another.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><strong>Tip:</strong> Help your teenager to understand that acts of discrimination and even genocide often start with feelings of racial superiority.

<h2 id="p27" data-pid="27"><strong>How to set the example</strong></h2>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>Children learn by example, so it is important for you as a parent to consider your speech and actions. For instance:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  Do you joke about people of other races or belittle them? “Your children are watching and listening to you and naturally model their behavior after yours,” says the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>  Do you enjoy being with people from other areas of the world? Pediatrician Alanna Nzoma says: “If you want your kids to . . . create [good] relationships with people from different backgrounds, they should see you doing this.”</p>

<blockquote><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em>“Over the years, our family hosted guests from all parts of the world.

<h2 id="p33" data-pid="33"><strong>If your child is a victim of prejudice</strong></h2>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Despite much talk about equality, racism is rampant. This means that your child might be treated unkindly, especially if he or she is considered to be part of a minority group. If that happens . . .</p>

</div>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><strong>Get the facts.</strong> Was the offense intentional, or was it just a lapse in good judgment? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>) Does the offender need to be called to account, or can the incident be overlooked?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>Clearly, balance is needed. The Bible offers wise advice: “Do not be quick to take offense.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>) Racism should not be minimized, but not every perceived insult constitutes a hate crime or racial hatred.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>Of course, each situation is different, so find out what actually happened before you decide whether to take any action.</p>
<div class="blockTxt"><p id="p38" data-pid="38"><em>“When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts, it is foolish and humiliating.”</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:13</a>.</p>
</div>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>After getting the facts, ask yourself:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p40" data-pid="40"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span>  ‘Will my child benefit by assuming the worst about people and feeling victimized by every perceived insult?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p41" data-pid="41"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span>  ‘Could my child benefit by following the Biblical advice: “Do not take to heart every word that people say”?’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:21-21:7:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:21</a>.</p>

</ul>

</div>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>What if the offense seems intentional?</strong> Help your child realize that things can get better or worse depending on how he or she responds. Sometimes a person who taunts, bullies, or insults another person is looking for a reaction. In such cases, the best response may be <strong>no</strong> response.</p>
<div class="blockTxt"><p id="p44" data-pid="44"><em>“Where there is no wood, the fire goes out.”</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:20-20:26:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:20</a>.</p>
</div>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>On the other hand, if it is safe for your child to do so, he or she might be able to talk to the offender. Perhaps your child could say (in a nonconfrontational way), “I really didn’t think that what you said (or did) was very kind.”</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>What if you want to report the incident?</strong> If your child’s welfare is threatened or for some other reason you feel that the situation should not be overlooked, feel free to talk to school officials or even to the police if needed.</p>
