<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>A smartphone is like a power tool—it can be helpful or harmful, depending on how it is used. How can you teach your children to show good judgment with this powerful device? For example, how much screen time is too much?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  <strong>The smartphone exposes the user to danger.</strong> As shown in the article “Children and Smartphones—Part 1: Should My Child Have a Smartphone?” the smartphone provides access to everything the Internet has to offer, both good and bad.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“It’s easy to forget that a smartphone can expose our children to all sorts of dangerous people and ideas.”—Brenda.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>  Children need guidance.</strong> Young people were born into the culture of technology, whereas many adults are relative newcomers to it. However, this doesn’t mean that parents are technologically incompetent and that kids are better qualified to decide how and when to use their smartphones.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Granted, your children might be more adept than you are at navigating a smartphone, but do not confuse ability with maturity. Even tech-savvy children need parental guidance when it comes to the responsible use of a smartphone.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>“Giving your child a smartphone without training is like giving him the keys to a car, sitting him in the driver’s seat, starting the engine, and saying ‘Please be careful’ without first giving him driving lessons.”—Seth.</em></p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>  Learn the features of your child’s phone.</strong> Become familiar with the tools that can help your child use the phone responsibly. For example:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>What parental controls does the phone have to limit usage?</em></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>Do you know that phone settings that block inappropriate content are not foolproof?</em></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The more you know about your child’s smartphone, the better prepared you will be to help him use it responsibly.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “With knowledge a man increases his power.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:5-20:24:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:5</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>  Set boundaries.</strong> Decide what you will and will not allow. For example:</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><em>Will you allow your child to bring the phone to the dinner table or to use it while visiting with family or friends?</em></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><em>Should your children have their phone in the bedroom overnight?</em></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span><em>What apps will you allow?</em></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span><em>How much screen time is too much?</em></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><em>Will you set a time limit on daily usage?</em></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>Make your rules known, and be prepared to enforce disciplinary measures if the rules are broken.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Do not hold back discipline from a youth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:13-20:23:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:13</a>, footnote.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>  Monitor.</strong> Know your child’s password, and check the contents of his or her phone as needed, including text messages, apps, pictures, and sites visited.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><em>“We told our daughter that we might make periodic unannounced checks on her phone. Her phone privileges were subject to change if she was irresponsible with it.”—Lorraine.</em></p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span>As a parent, you have every right to know how your child’s smartphone is being used.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “A child is known by his actions, whether his behavior is pure and right.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:11-20:20:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:11</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong>  Teach values.</strong> Help your child <em>want</em> to do what is right. Why is that important? Because a determined child may try to work around a parent’s best efforts at monitoring.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>Therefore, train your child to have virtuous qualities such as honesty, self-control, and a sense of responsibility for his or her actions. A child who has moral values is more likely to use a phone wisely.</p>
