<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Alcohol abuse and marriage—a destructive mix</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>Alcohol abuse can lead to all sorts of health problems, including heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver, and cancer. But alcohol abuse is more than a health issue; it is also a marriage issue that raises the risk of domestic violence, financial problems, unfaithfulness, and divorce.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible says that when alcohol is abused, “it bites like a serpent, and it secretes poison like a viper.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:32-20:23:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:32</a>) How do you know if <strong>you</strong> are dependent on alcohol?</p>
<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>Are you dependent on alcohol?</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>The following questions can help you identify the symptoms:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  Do you have trouble controlling your drinking?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  Are you often thinking about when you will drink next?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  Do you drink despite the problems that it causes in your life—including in your marriage?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  Do you experience withdrawal symptoms when you try to quit?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  Is your drinking a cause for arguments with your spouse?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>  Is your tolerance for alcohol greater than it used to be?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>  Do you sneak drinks or hide alcohol at home or at work?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span>If you answer yes to one or more of those questions, you could have become dependent on alcohol. You might have alcohol use disorder, also known as alcoholism.</p>
<h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>Beware of denial</strong></h2>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>Has your spouse expressed concern about your drinking? If so, you may have tried to minimize or justify your behavior. You might have blamed others, including your spouse, by saying things such as:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  “If you treated me better, I wouldn’t have to drink.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  “If you had my boss, you’d need to drink too.”</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>  “I know plenty of people who drink more than I do.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>If you make statements like those, could you be putting your desire to drink above your desire to have a happy marriage? Which should be more important?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “The married man is anxious for . . . how he may gain the approval of his wife.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:33-46:7:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p29" data-pid="29"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>  Take your spouse’s concerns seriously.</strong> Even if your spouse is oversensitive to the issue, why not make adjustments? If you cannot do so—if you insist on drinking despite the anxiety that it causes your spouse—that in itself may indicate that alcohol has become a problem.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:24-46:10:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>  Get informed.</strong> To win a battle, a soldier needs to know the tactics of his enemy. You face a similar challenge—to conquer your enemy, you need to learn about the nature of alcoholism and how it ensnares people. You will also need to learn effective strategies to help you break any dependency on alcohol and to help you avoid relapse.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Keep abstaining from fleshly desires, which wage war against you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:11-60:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:11</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong>  Get help.</strong> There are a number of health-care resources that focus on alcohol use disorder, including recovery programs, treatment centers, and hospitals. You can also reach out to a mature friend who can help you identify any underlying issues that contribute to your dependency on alcohol. Then call on this person when you feel an urge to return to your former habit.</p>
