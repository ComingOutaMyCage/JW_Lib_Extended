<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Considering the risks involved, many parents do not allow their children to use social media. However, if you do allow your teenager to use social media, how can you help him or her both to avoid the negative effects and to learn to be a good digital citizen?</p>

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>Your teenager’s priorities</strong></h2>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> In view of the addictive nature of social media, your teenager might need your help to control the amount of time he or she spends on it.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Make sure of the more important things.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Does use of social media interfere with your teenager’s sleep, schoolwork, or family life? Researchers say that teenagers need about nine hours of sleep per night, but those who spend several hours a day on social media are likely to be getting less than seven hours of sleep.</p>

</div>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Discuss priorities with your teenager, and talk about the wisdom of limiting the amount of time spent on social media. Set reasonable rules, such as no devices allowed in the bedroom at night. Your goal is to help your teen cultivate self-control—a quality that will serve him or her well in adulthood.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:25-46:9:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>.</p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>Your teenager’s emotional health</strong></h2>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> Looking at the digitally enhanced selfies and “highlight reels” of friends’ activities can leave a young person feeling left out, anxious, and depressed.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Rid yourselves of . . . envy.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:1-60:2:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Does social media use cause your teenager to make unhealthy comparisons in regard to personal appearance and body image? Does your teen feel that everyone else’s life is exciting, while his or hers is boring?</p>

</div>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Discuss with your teenager the dangers of comparisons. Be aware that girls may be more affected than boys, as girls tend to place more emphasis on relationship and body-image issues. You can even suggest that your teen take periodic breaks from social media. A young man named Jacob says: “I deleted my social-media app for a time. It helped me adjust my priorities as well as my view of myself and others.”</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>What you should know:</strong> Being on social media has been likened to living in front of a crowd. Misunderstandings and conflicts are bound to arise.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “Put away from yourselves every kind of malicious bitterness, anger, wrath, screaming, and abusive speech . . . Become kind to one another.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31, 32</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Has social media caused your teenager to get caught up in gossip, conflict, or unkind speech?</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>What you can do:</strong> Help your teen to understand the principles of good online manners.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure your teenager is getting sufficient face-to-face interaction with others. A young woman named Ellen says, “Calling people on the phone or visiting with them tells me more about them than looking at a hundred of their social media posts.”</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>Remember that social media is not a necessity and that not all parents allow their teenagers to use it.
