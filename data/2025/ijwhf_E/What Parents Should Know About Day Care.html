<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Some working parents decide to send their preschoolers to a day-care center—a facility that operates similar to a classroom. Would that be good for your child?</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Questions you should ask</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Will day care interfere with parent-child bonding?</strong> It could. During the early years, a child’s brain develops rapidly in ways that affect how he relates to others. Try to be with your child as much as possible during this formative period.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</a>.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong> </strong> Parents considering day care should think about how they will maintain a close bond with their child.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Will day care weaken your influence?</strong> It could. “The more time preschoolers spend with one another, the more they are influenced by their peers,” says the book <em>Hold On to Your Kids.</em></p>
<ul><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong> </strong> Parents considering day care should think about whether they will be able to remain the primary influence in their child’s life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Will day care give your child an academic advantage when he or she starts school?</strong> Some say yes. Others say that day care has little or no impact on a child’s development. In any event, child psychologist Penelope Leach writes: “Try not to let yourselves believe that ‘education’ is the key to getting on in life and that the more a child has of it, and the earlier she begins, the better. If you do, you will underestimate the ‘education’ you have been giving your child since birth.”</p>
<ul><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong> </strong> Parents considering day care should think about whether it is beneficial or even necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Is it possible for you or your spouse to be a stay-at-home parent?</strong> In some cases, both parents work simply to maintain a higher standard of living. Are the benefits worth the cost?</p>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong> </strong> Parents thinking about day care should consider whether they can cut back on expenses so that one parent can be at home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span>The decision to send your child to a day-care center should be made only after you have carefully weighed the pros and cons. After doing so, what if you feel that day care is a good choice for your family?</p>
<h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>The Bible says that “the shrewd one ponders each step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>) With that principle in mind, think carefully before choosing any form of day care.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Learn about your options</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong> </strong> Some parents choose a child-care home—a residential setting with one or perhaps a few caregivers and a small group of children.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong> </strong> Other parents have a relative, a live-in caregiver, or a babysitter look after their child.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>All options have pros and cons. Why not talk to other parents who have used some form of day care? The Bible says: “Wisdom belongs to those who seek advice.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:10-20:13:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>What if you opt for a day-care center? In that case . . .</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span><strong>Learn about the facility</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong> </strong> Is it licensed or regulated in whatever way is required by law? What credentials, references, or reputation does it have?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p25" data-pid="25"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong> </strong> Is the facility clean and safe?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong> </strong> What activities are provided?<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"></span><strong>Learn about the caregivers</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong> </strong> What training do they have? This would include training in early childhood education, first aid, and CPR.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span><strong> </strong> Are you able to do a background check for any criminal records of those who will take care of your child?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span><strong> </strong> Are there frequent changes in staff? Frequent turnover would mean that your child would have to adjust continually to new caregivers.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span><strong> </strong> What is the child-to-caregiver ratio at the facility? A high child-to-adult ratio might mean that your child will receive less attention than needed. Of course, how much attention your child needs would depend on his age and capability.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span><strong> </strong> Are the caregivers willing to communicate with you about your concerns—or theirs?</p>
