<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>To think about:</strong> Do your actions show that you view your marriage as more important than your work or your hobbies? Does your spouse get only the leftovers of your time and attention?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not leave things to chance. Schedule periods of undistracted time to spend with your spouse.</p>
