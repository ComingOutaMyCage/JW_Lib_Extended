<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Differences in interests, habits, and personality traits can be challenging enough for married couples to deal with. But some issues, such as the following, can be even more sensitive:</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Some problems cannot be solved by simple compromise.</strong> For example, what if an in-law gets sick and needs care?

<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Different viewpoints need not doom your marriage.</strong> Some experts say that if you and your spouse are at an impasse on a serious issue, you should do whatever it takes to get your way—even if that means walking away from your marriage. But that “solution” puts too much importance on your feelings and too little importance on your vow before God to stick with your spouse, come what may.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Be determined to honor your marriage vow.</strong> With that foundation, you will be better able to approach the issue as a team rather than as opponents.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span><strong>Count the cost.</strong> For example, suppose one spouse wants to have children but the other does not. There are a number of factors to consider, including:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p21" data-pid="21"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>  The strength of your relationship.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"></span>Can your marriage handle the added stress of raising a child?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  The responsibilities of parenthood.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span>More is involved than providing food, clothing, and shelter.</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"></span><strong>Consider all aspects of the matter.</strong> You may be able to resolve some points of conflict. For example, if the issue is whether to have children, the spouse who is reluctant could ask himself or herself:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"></span>  ‘When I say that I do not want to have children, do I mean <em>not ever</em> or just <em>not now?’</em></p>
</li>
<li><p id="p30" data-pid="30"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>  ‘Am I hesitant because I doubt that I could be a good parent?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p31" data-pid="31"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"></span>  ‘Am I afraid that my spouse will neglect me?’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>On the other hand, the spouse who wants to have children could consider such questions as:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p33" data-pid="33"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"></span>  ‘Are we ready for the responsibilities of parenthood?’</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span>  ‘Are we in a financial position to raise a child?’</p>

</blockquote>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>Recognize the merits of your spouse’s viewpoint.</strong> Two people can look at the same scene and yet have different views of it.

To discuss any situation where viewpoints clash, start with what you have in common.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p37" data-pid="37"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"></span>  What is your shared objective?</p>
