<ul><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>  Marriage can make you very aware of your spouse’s faults.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><em>“Once the novelty of marriage wears off, it’s easy to focus on the less desirable qualities of your spouse. When that negative attitude creeps in, it’s easy to lose your patience.”—Jessena.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>  Impatience can cause you to speak before you think.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><em>“I express what I’m feeling very readily—almost too readily. If I were more patient, I could put things in perspective and move on without needing to say anything.”—Carmen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>The Bible says: “Love is patient and kind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>) It seems only reasonable that two people who love each other would show patience. But this is not always the case. “Like any good quality,” notes John, quoted earlier, “patience decays more easily than it grows. It takes effort to keep it growing.”</p>

<h2 id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>How can you show patience?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>  When a sudden incident tests your patience.</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><strong>Example:</strong> Your spouse says something unkind to you. Your impulse is to say something unkind in return.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><em>Bible principle: “Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense is the mark of a fool.”—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Ecclesiastes 7:9</em></a><em>, footnote.</em></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>How to show patience:</strong> Pause. Before responding, try to attribute your spouse’s remark to something <em>other</em> than a deliberate attack. “Most of us react more to <em>our interpretation</em> of what was said than to what our partner meant and actually did say,” states the book <em>Fighting for Your Marriage.</em></p>

</div>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Even if your spouse was trying to provoke you, your showing patience by restraining yourself from retaliating can ease the tension rather than add to it. “Where there is no wood, the fire goes out,” says the Bible.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:20-20:26:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:20</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>How to show patience:</strong> Try to put the needs of your relationship above your personal needs. Ask yourself, ‘Will making an issue over this help our relationship or hurt it?’ Also, remember that “we all stumble many times.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 3:2</a>) This means that you too have things to work on.</p>
