<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Between 1990 and 2015, the divorce rate for those 50 years of age and older doubled in the United States, and it tripled for those over 65. Researchers have coined the phrase “gray divorce” to describe the growing number of divorces among older people. What is behind “gray divorce”? How can you keep it from affecting <strong>your</strong> marriage?</p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>What causes gray divorce?</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong> </strong> Often, older couples who divorce have simply grown apart gradually. Over time, some husbands and wives develop separate interests and seem to have little in common with each other. Or after the children have left home, a couple may realize that they have been in the roles of dad and mom for so long that they have forgotten how to be husband and wife.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong> </strong> In recent decades, so-called experts have told spouses to focus on their own needs. ‘Does my marriage make me happy?’ ‘Is it making me a better person?’ ‘Does my spouse meet my emotional needs?’ If not, the current thinking goes, you should do what’s best for <strong>you—</strong>get a divorce and start a new life.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  Divorce has lost its stigma. “Not long ago,” writes sociologist Eric Klinenberg, “someone who was dissatisfied with his or her spouse and wanted a divorce had to justify that decision. Today it’s the opposite: If you’re not fulfilled by your marriage, you have to justify staying in it, because of the tremendous cultural pressure to be good to one’s self.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Of course, divorce often just exchanges one set of problems for another. For example, one study revealed that “gray divorce is often financially devastating, especially for women.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>There is something else to consider. “You can set off for a fresh start, but it’s the same old you,” says the book <em>Don’t Divorce.</em> “What have you done to change the communication style that didn’t work with your spouse? What have you done to change how you deal with conflict?”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>  Accept change.</strong> No relationship is static. Your relationship with your spouse may have changed because your children have moved away or because the two of you have developed different interests. Instead of dwelling on the way things were in the past, think of how to improve the way things are now.</p>

<li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  <strong>Keep your friendship alive.</strong> Could you embrace a new interest that your spouse has, or could you invite your spouse to share in one of yours? Could you make room for a <em>new</em> activity that you both enjoy? Your goal should be to spend time together, so that you and your spouse feel more like marriage mates than roommates.</p>

Say “please” and “thank you.” Regularly express affection, and show appreciation for the things that your spouse does for you.</p>
