<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>What you should know</strong></h2>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Children can be exposed to pornography at an early age.</strong> Studies show that the average age when children first see pornography is now 11.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Children can be exposed to pornography without looking for it.</strong> For example, they might come across pornography while doing harmless research on a search engine or while browsing social media. Advertisements for porn might pop up while they are playing online video games. Pornography comes in different formats, the most common being photos and videos. However, explicitly erotic material is readily available in written form and in audio podcasts, all of which can be streamed or downloaded online.</p>

</div>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Another factor to consider is that individuals may send children explicit material electronically, such as through messaging apps. In one study of over 900 youths, nearly 90 percent of girls and nearly 50 percent of boys said they receive nude photos and videos from classmates on a regular basis.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Mainstream pornography is often violent.</strong> The most popular and easily accessible pornography frequently contains some level of violence, often toward women.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><strong>Pornography harms children.</strong> Research shows that children who are exposed to pornography are more likely to do the following:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  fall behind in school</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  experience anxiety, depression, and low self-worth</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>  view sexual aggression as normal behavior</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Children are vulnerable to the harmful effects of pornography, and parents are in the best position to protect them.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Bible principle:</strong> “These words that I am commanding you today must be on your heart, and you must inculcate them in your sons and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"></span><strong>Educate yourself.</strong> Consider when and where your child is more likely to be exposed to porn. For example, does he have unsupervised Internet access during breaks at school?</p>

For example, some messaging apps have a “disappearing” message function that allows an explicit message, image, or video to disappear after a short period of time. And an increasing number of online video games allow players to view pornography and even engage in virtual sexual acts within the game.</p>

Wise parents will educate their child about the dangers of porn <em>before</em> he is exposed to it. How can you do so?</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"></span><strong>Talk regularly.</strong> As hard as it may be to believe, kids actually want to talk to their parents about sexual issues, including pornography. “The overriding message [from kids] is <strong><em>talk early, talk often,”</em></strong> says Dame Rachel de Souza, Children’s Commissioner for England. “Children want an age-appropriate conversation that evolves over time in line with their growing maturity.”</p>

<h2 id="p38" data-pid="38"><strong>If your child has been exposed to pornography</strong></h2>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"></span><strong>Remain calm.</strong> If you discover that your child has viewed, listened to, or read pornography, try to control your reaction. He may already feel upset, shocked, or guilty about what happened. Reacting in anger will only make him feel worse and may make him less likely to approach you in the future.</p>
