<p id="p3" data-pid="3"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Your child does not seem to care about school, and he dodges homework and study. The result? His grades go downhill, along with his attitude. How can you help your child improve his grades?</p>

<h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What you should know</strong></h2>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span><strong>Pressure increases the problem.</strong> Putting pressure on your child causes him anxiety at school <em>and</em> at home! To relieve the stress, he may lie, conceal low grades, fake your signature on his report card, or skip school. The problem will only worsen.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span><strong>Rewards may backfire.</strong> “To motivate our daughter, we tried rewarding good grades,” says a father named Andrew, “but that only caused her to focus on the reward. When she got a bad grade, she was more disappointed about not getting the reward than about the bad grade.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span><strong>Blaming the teachers is unproductive.</strong> Your child may conclude that good results do not require effort. He might also learn to shift the blame for his mistakes and to expect others to solve his problems. In short, your child could miss out on a skill that is vital for adult life​—accepting responsibility for his actions.</p>
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>What you can do</strong></h2>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span><strong>Control your feelings.</strong> If you feel angry, postpone any discussion with your child about grades. “My wife and I have achieved the best results when we are calm and empathetic,” says a father named Brett.</p>
<div class="grpItems indent"><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span><em>Bible principle: “Be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.”​—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>James 1:​19</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</div><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span><strong>Identify the real problem.</strong> Common reasons for bad grades are bullying, changing schools, exam anxiety, family issues, lack of sleep, lack of a schedule, or lack of concentration. Do not assume your child is simply lazy.</p>
<div class="grpItems indent"><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span><em>Bible principle: “The one who shows insight in a matter will find success.”​—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:20-20:16:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 16:20</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</div><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Create an atmosphere conducive to learning.</strong> Make a schedule for homework and study. Have a place where your child can do his homework free from distractions (including television and mobile phones). Break homework sessions into shorter units to help your child concentrate. Hector, a father from Germany, says, “If a test is coming up, we review a little each day instead of waiting till the last minute.”</p>
<div class="grpItems indent"><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><em>Bible principle: “There is an appointed time for everything.”​—</em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Ecclesiastes 3:1</em></a><em>.</em></p>
</div><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span><strong>Encourage learning.</strong> The better your child understands how he benefits from school <em>now,</em> the more he will feel motivated to learn. For example, math can help him budget his pocket money.</p>
