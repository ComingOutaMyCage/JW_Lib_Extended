<p id="p9" data-pid="9"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>From 2009 to 2019, the United States saw a 40 percent increase in the number of high school students with symptoms of depression. The suicide rate also rose during that period.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>How do you know if your child is at risk?</strong></h2>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>Consider the following factors.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Events.</strong> Has your child dealt with a tragedy—a rejection, a breakup, a failure of some kind, or the death of a loved one? If so, could it be affecting her<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> more than you realize?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>  <strong>Behavior.</strong> Has your child withdrawn from friends or family or lost interest in activities that she used to enjoy? Has she given away beloved possessions?</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>  <strong>Statements.</strong> Does your child talk about death or say things such as, “It would be better if I weren’t alive”? Does she talk about not wanting to be a burden to you?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Of course, some statements might be just “wild talk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:3-18:6:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 6:3</a>) But others could be cries for help. So do not dismiss <strong>anything</strong> your child says about wanting to die.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="boxSupplement rule"><aside><div class="boxContent"><p id="p18" data-pid="18"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"></span><strong>Try this:</strong> Talk with your child. You could ask outright, “Have you thought about taking your life?” Saying this will <em>not</em> put the thought in your child’s head.</p>
</div>
</aside></div>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>If your child says she <em>has</em> considered taking her life, you could ask, “Have you thought about when or how you would do it?” Her answer will indicate how urgent the situation is.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>  <strong>Patiently draw out your child.</strong> First, commend her for her honesty. Then you could say: “I want to understand what you have been going through. Tell me what’s been going on lately” or “Can you describe what it’s like for you to feel this way?”</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"></span>Listen patiently to your child’s replies. Resist any urge to trivialize her feelings or to dole out quick “solutions.”</p>

<li><p id="p26" data-pid="26"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>  <strong>Create a safety plan.</strong> Help your child identify and write down the following:</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"></span><strong>Warning signs.</strong> Which circumstances or thinking patterns usually precede suicidal urges?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"></span><strong>Outlets.</strong> Which activities most effectively help her reduce stress and redirect her thinking?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"></span><strong>Resources.</strong> Does your child have a support network—people she can turn to when she needs help? This might include you, another trusted adult, a mental-health professional, or an agency that is trained to help people with suicidal thoughts.</p>
