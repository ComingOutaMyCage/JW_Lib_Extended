<p id="p14" data-pid="14">The individuals quoted in this magazine are among the millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses who have been helped by the Bible to find peace. They have learned how to overcome racial, national, tribal, and personal hatreds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:31-49:4:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:31, 32</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses are politically neutral and refuse to take part in violence.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15">Jehovah’s Witnesses also find support in their loving worldwide brotherhood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) For instance, Oleksandra, quoted earlier, had to flee with her sister to another country because of war. She says: “When we crossed the border, we immediately saw local Witnesses who were there to welcome us. Their support helped us adapt to living in a new country as refugees.”</p>
