<p id="p4" data-pid="4">War and violent conflict can break out in places currently at peace. Even those who are far from a conflict may suffer because the world is more interconnected than ever before. And the harm inflicted lasts long after the fighting ends. Consider some examples:</p>

</div>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>Physical and mental health problems.</strong> The threat of war and the insecurity that it brings can cause people to suffer stress and anxiety. Those who live in conflict zones are not only more likely to suffer physical harm but also to develop mental health problems. Yet, they often have limited access to medical services.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Forced displacement.</strong> As of September 2023, more than 114 million people worldwide had been forced to flee their homes, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A major reason for this crisis is war and violent conflict.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>Economic hardship.</strong> People often experience economic problems triggered by war, such as inflation. They may suffer when government resources are diverted away from services such as health care and education in order to fund military operations. And the cost of rebuilding after the devastation caused by war is enormous.</p>
