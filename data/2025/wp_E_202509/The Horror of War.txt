The Horror of War

Few experiences affect people more deeply than war and violent conflict. Soldiers and civilians around the world know the tragic effects firsthand.


SOLDIERS

“Catastrophic events​—life-changing injuries or death—​happen all around you. There is a constant feeling of uncertainty.”​—Gary, Britain.


“I was hit by bullets in my back and face, and I saw many killed, including children and the elderly. War makes you hard-hearted.”​—Wilmar, Colombia.


“When someone is shot in front of you, the scene doesn’t just go away. The screaming and moaning continue. You don’t forget about that person​—ever.”​—Zafirah, United States.

CIVILIANS

“I felt like I could never be happy again. You fear for your life, but even more than that, you fear for the lives of your family and friends.”​—Oleksandra, Ukraine.


“It is terrifying to stand in line for food from 2:00 a.m. until 11:00 p.m., not knowing if you will be hit by a stray bullet.”​—Daler, Tajikistan.


“War left me without parents. It made me an orphan with no one to comfort or care for me.”​—Marie, Rwanda.


Despite the tragic effects of war, the individuals quoted above have found peace. What is more, they are convinced that all war and violent conflict will soon end. This issue of The Watchtower will use the Bible to explain how that will happen.
