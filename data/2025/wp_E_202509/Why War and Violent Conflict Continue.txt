Why War and Violent Conflict Continue

The Bible reveals the root causes of war and violent conflict and why these tragic events persist.


SIN
God created our first parents, Adam and Eve, in his image. (Genesis 1:27) That meant they would naturally reflect God’s qualities, including peace and love. (1 Corinthians 14:33; 1 John 4:8) However, Adam and Eve disobeyed God and sinned. As a result, all of us have inherited sin and death. (Romans 5:12) Inherited sin inclines us toward violent thoughts and actions.​—Genesis 6:5; Mark 7:21, 22.
HUMAN GOVERNMENT
God did not create us to rule ourselves. The Bible says: “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (Jeremiah 10:23) For that reason, human governments cannot completely eliminate war and violence.
SATAN AND HIS DEMONS
The Bible reveals that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) That “wicked one” is called Satan the Devil, and he has a murderous disposition. (John 8:44) He along with other wicked spirit creatures are the unseen instigators of war and violence.​—Revelation 12:9, 12.

We cannot eliminate the root causes of war and violence, but God can.


Religion and War
Religions often condone, justify, or promote war. Such religions are among the false religious institutions collectively referred to as “Babylon the Great.” (Revelation 18:2) God holds Babylon the Great responsible for the death “of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth.”(Revelation 18:24) To learn more, read the article “What Is Babylon the Great?” on jw.org.
