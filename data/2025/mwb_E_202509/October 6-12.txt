  How can we introduce a simple Bible truth at an appropriate time in a conversation?​—lmd appendix A

Your answer



  Which topics do you find most effective in your territory?

Your answer



  What could you do to become more familiar with the scriptures in appendix A?

Your answer





GOAL:
Try to remember at least one scripture per topic featured in appendix A. Start with those that may be the most appealing in your territory.



The more we use these scriptures in the ministry, the more familiar we become with them. To use them regularly, however, we must first contact people in our territory.
