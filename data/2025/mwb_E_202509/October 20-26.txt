7. Finding Stability in the Face of Tragedy



(15 min.) Discussion.

We face trials and challenges on a daily basis. However, some trials happen so suddenly and are so devastating that they can overwhelm us emotionally, physically, and even spiritually. How can we find stability in the face of tragedy?
No matter what trial we face, Jehovah is always ‘the stability of our times.’ (Isa 33:6) To rely on Jehovah, we need to be balanced and modest. (Pr 11:2) If we experience a tragic event, we may need to take time to care for ourselves or a loved one, to make wise decisions, or to allow ourselves to grieve. (Ec 4:6)
Since Jehovah uses his worshippers to strengthen one another, we must also be willing to accept or ask for help. Remember, your fellow worshippers love you deeply, and it makes them happy to support you.
Read 2 Corinthians 4:7-9. Then ask the audience:
  Why should we do our best to keep up with our basic spiritual routine even when it may be difficult to do so?
