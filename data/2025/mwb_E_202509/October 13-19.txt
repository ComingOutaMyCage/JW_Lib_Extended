8. Build Strong Faith in the Resurrection


(15 min.) Discussion.







Jehovah’s promise of a resurrection is one of our most precious possessions. It teaches us about Jehovah’s qualities​—his power, wisdom, mercy, and especially his love for us personally.​—Joh 3:16.
When we have strong faith in the resurrection, we can see beyond our trials. (2Co 4:16-18) We can also enjoy a measure of peace and comfort when we face persecution, illness, or the death of a loved one. (1Th 4:13) We cannot be truly happy if we do not have faith in the resurrection. (1Co 15:19) Why not make it a goal to strengthen your faith in this wonderful hope?
Read John 11:21-24. Then ask the audience:
