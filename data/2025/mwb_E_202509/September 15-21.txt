7. Help Your Children to Use Electronic Devices Wisely


(8 min.) Discussion.

Have you ever watched a young child navigate his way through apps on a smartphone or tablet? It often seems so easy for children! They may rarely need help to learn how to use a device, but they always need help to learn how to use it wisely. If you are a parent, how can you train your child to use a device wisely?







Play the VIDEO The Best Use of Time. Then ask the audience:
  Why is it good to set limits on our use of electronic devices?

Your answer



  What other things do we need to make time for?

Your answer




When setting rules for your family, rely on Bible principles rather than on what other parents do. (Ga 6:5) For example, ask yourself:
  Has my child demonstrated sufficient self-control and responsibility for his actions to use my device, or even to have his own?​—1Co 9:25

  To what extent should I supervise my child’s activities?​—Pr 18:1

  What apps and websites will I allow my child to use, and which ones will I not allow him to use?​—Eph 5:3-5; Php 4:8, 9

  What is a reasonable limit for daily usage that will allow time for other enjoyable and important activities?​—Ec 3:1
