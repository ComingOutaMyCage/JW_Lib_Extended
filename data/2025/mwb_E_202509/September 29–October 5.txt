LIVING AS CHRISTIANS

7. When Marital Problems Arise, Keep Jehovah in the Picture


(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah has given Christian couples all that they need to enjoy a happy, successful marriage. Still, married couples will experience problems from time to time. (1Co 7:28) If not addressed, those problems can cause heartache and, at times, even seem insurmountable. What if you face such problems in your marriage?
The dramatization What Is True Love? depicted a young couple experiencing serious marital problems. Do you remember the advice the father gave his daughter when she was about to make a decision that did not take Jehovah into consideration?
Play the VIDEO DRAMATIZATION What Is True Love?​—Excerpt. Then ask the audience:
  Why should we rely on Jehovah’s guidance when we experience marital problems?​—Isa 48:17; Mt 19:6

Your answer




If you experience serious problems in your marriage, keep Jehovah involved by maintaining a good spiritual routine. Work hard to resolve your problems using Bible principles, and look for information in our publications that will help you view your situation as Jehovah does. By doing so, you invite Jehovah’s support and blessing.​—Pr 10:22; Isa 41:10.
