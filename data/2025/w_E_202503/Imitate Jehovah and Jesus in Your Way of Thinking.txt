SONG 31 Oh, Walk With God!

Imitate Jehovah and Jesus in Your Way of Thinking


“Since Christ suffered in the flesh, you too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition.”​—1 PET. 4:1.


FOCUS
How the apostle Peter learned from Jesus’ way of thinking and how we can too.


1-2. What is involved in loving Jehovah, and how did Jesus give evidence of that?

Your answer


“YOU must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind.” (Luke 10:27) Jesus acknowledged this as the most important command in the Mosaic Law. Notice that our love for Jehovah involves our heart, which includes our desires, feelings, and emotions. It also involves our whole-souled devotion and our strength​—including our energy. However, loving Jehovah also involves our mind, which includes the way we think about matters. Of course, we can never fully understand all of Jehovah’s thinking. But we can better understand God’s thinking by studying “the mind of Christ” because Jesus perfectly reflects the thinking of his Father.​—1 Cor. 2:16 and study note “we do have the mind of Christ.”
2 Jesus loved Jehovah with his whole mind. He knew God’s will for him and was determined to act in harmony with it, even though doing so would mean suffering for the sake of what was right. Being focused on doing his Father’s will, Jesus allowed nothing to distract him from that goal.
 3. What did the apostle Peter learn from Jesus, and what did Peter encourage fellow Christians to do? (1 Peter 4:1)

Your answer


3 Peter and his fellow apostles were privileged to spend time with Jesus and to learn firsthand how he thought. When Peter wrote his first inspired letter, he encouraged Christians to arm themselves with the same mental disposition as that of Christ.a (Read 1 Peter 4:1.) Peter used a military expression when he wrote: “Arm yourselves.” So if Christians imitate Jesus’ mental disposition, or way of thinking, they will be equipped with a powerful weapon in their war against sinful tendencies and against a world ruled by Satan.​—2 Cor. 10:3-5; Eph. 6:12.
 4. How can this article help us follow Peter’s advice?

Your answer


4 We will examine Jesus’ way of thinking and see how we can imitate it. We will find out how we can (1) imitate Jehovah’s way of thinking, which will help us all to think in agreement, (2) be humble, and (3) be sound in mind by relying on Jehovah in prayer.
IMITATE JEHOVAH’S WAY OF THINKING
 5. How did Peter on one occasion fail to reflect Jehovah’s thinking?

Your answer


5 Consider one occasion when Peter did not reflect Jehovah’s thinking on matters. Jesus had told his apostles that he would have to go to Jerusalem, be handed over to the religious leaders there, endure torture, and then be put to death. (Matt. 16:21) Peter may have found it hard to accept that Jehovah would allow Jesus​—the hope of Israel and the promised Messiah—​to be put to death. (Matt. 16:16) So Peter took Jesus aside and said: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this happen to you at all.” (Matt. 16:22) Because Peter did not reflect Jehovah’s thinking on the matter, he was not thinking in agreement with Jesus.
 6. In what way did Jesus show that his thinking was in line with Jehovah’s?

Your answer


6 Jesus’ thinking was fully in line with that of his heavenly Father. Jesus said to Peter: “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.” (Matt. 16:23) Peter may have had good intentions, but Jesus rejected Peter’s advice. There is a lesson for us. Leading a self-sparing life was not Jehovah’s will for Jesus. On that occasion, Peter learned a valuable lesson about making God’s thoughts his thoughts.
 7. How did Peter later show that he was sensitive to Jehovah’s thinking? (See picture.)

Your answer


7 Eventually, Peter showed that he wanted to be attuned to Jehovah’s way of thinking. The time had arrived for uncircumcised Gentiles to become part of God’s people. Peter was assigned to preach to the Gentile Cornelius, who would be among the first of this new group of worshippers. Jews had very little to do with Gentiles, so it is not surprising that Peter needed help to prepare for his assignment. When Peter discerned God’s will in this matter, he adjusted his viewpoint. As a result, when he was sent for, he went “without objection.” (Acts 10:28, 29) He preached to Cornelius and his household, and they got baptized.​—Acts 10:21-23, 34, 35, 44-48.

 8. How can we show that our thinking is in line with Jehovah’s thinking? (1 Peter 3:8 and footnote)

Your answer


8 Years later, Peter encouraged fellow Christians to “think in agreement.” (Read 1 Peter 3:8 and footnote.) As Jehovah’s people, we can think in agreement by reflecting Jehovah’s thinking as it is expressed in his Word. For example, Jesus urged his followers to put the Kingdom first in their life. (Matt. 6:33) With that in mind, a publisher in your congregation might decide to undertake some form of full-time service. Rather than suggest that he be kind to himself, we should speak positively about that worthy endeavor and offer our support.
BE HUMBLE
9-10. How did Jesus show extraordinary humility?

Your answer


9 On the night before he was put to death, Jesus taught Peter and the other apostles an important lesson in humility. Earlier, Jesus had sent Peter and John to get things ready for the last meal that Jesus would share with them as a human. The preparations likely included making sure that a basin and towels were available so that the guests could have their feet washed before the meal. But who would care for this humble task when the time came?
10 Without hesitation, Jesus showed extraordinary humility. Much to the astonishment of his apostles, he did something that a servant would normally do. Jesus took off his outer garments, wrapped a towel around his waist, put water into the basin, and started washing their feet. (John 13:4, 5) It may have taken some time to wash the feet of all 12 apostles​—including Judas, who was going to betray him. Yet, Jesus humbly completed the task. Then Jesus patiently explained: “Do you understand what I have done to you? You address me as ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you are correct, for I am such. Therefore, if I, the Lord and Teacher, washed your feet, you also should wash the feet of one another.”​—John 13:12-14.
True humility involves . . . our innermost thoughts

11. How did Peter show that he had learned to be humble? (1 Peter 5:5) (See also picture.)

Your answer


11 Peter learned from Jesus’ humility. After Jesus returned to heaven, Peter performed a miracle by healing a man who was lame from birth. (Acts 1:8, 9; 3:2, 6-8) Naturally, this amazing event drew a crowd of people. (Acts 3:11) Would Peter bask in the glory of the moment, given that he had come from a background where prominence and position were greatly emphasized? No, Peter humbly directed praise away from himself and gave the rightful credit to Jehovah and Jesus, saying: “Through [Jesus’] name, and by our faith in his name, this man whom you see and know has been made strong.” (Acts 3:12-16) The words Peter used in a letter to the Christians regarding the need to cultivate humility may remind us of the occasion when Jesus wrapped a towel around his waist and washed the feet of the apostles.​—Read 1 Peter 5:5.




After Peter performed a miracle, he humbly gave credit to Jehovah and Jesus. We too can show humility by doing good without expecting to be recognized or rewarded (See paragraphs 11-12)




12. How can we, like Peter, continue cultivating humility?

Your answer


12 We can follow Peter’s example in cultivating humility. Remember that true humility involves more than just saying the right words. The term Peter used for humility involves our innermost thoughts​—“lowliness of mind.” We perform tasks for others because we love Jehovah and we love people, not because we love to be admired. If we happily serve Jehovah and our brothers in any way we can, regardless of whether our efforts are noticed, we give evidence of being humble.​—Matt. 6:1-4.
BE “SOUND IN MIND”
13. Explain what is involved in being “sound in mind.”

Your answer


13 Being “sound in mind” involves what? (1 Pet. 4:7) A Christian who is sound in mind does his best to make good decisions that reflect Jehovah’s thinking. Such a Christian knows that nothing in life is more important than his relationship with Jehovah. He has a balanced view of himself, knowing that he does not have all the answers. And he demonstrates his reliance on God by approaching Jehovah often in humble prayer.b
14. How did Peter on one occasion fail to rely on Jehovah?

Your answer


14 On the last night before his death, Jesus warned his disciples: “All of you will be stumbled in connection with me on this night.” Peter responded confidently: “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you, I will never be stumbled!” That night Jesus admonished some of his disciples: “Keep on the watch and pray continually.” (Matt. 26:31, 33, 41) If Peter had followed that advice earlier, he might have had the courage to acknowledge his relationship with Jesus. Instead, Peter, much to his regret, disowned his Master.​—Matt. 26:69-75.
15. How did Jesus keep a sound mind during his final night of life as a human?

Your answer


15 Jesus relied fully on Jehovah. Although Jesus was perfect, he prayed repeatedly. That gave him the courage to act in line with Jehovah’s will for him. (Matt. 26:39, 42, 44; John 18:4, 5) Observing Jesus’ prayerful approach must have made a lifelong impression on Peter.
16. How did Peter show that he had cultivated soundness of mind? (1 Peter 4:7)

Your answer


16 In time, Peter came to rely more on Jehovah in prayer. The resurrected Jesus assured Peter and the other apostles that they would receive holy spirit so that they could fulfill their commission to preach. However, Jesus asked them to wait in Jerusalem until that happened. (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4, 5) What did Peter do while waiting? Peter and his fellow Christians “were persisting in prayer.” (Acts 1:13, 14) Later, in his first letter, Peter encouraged his fellow Christians to be sound in mind and to rely on Jehovah in prayer. (Read 1 Peter 4:7.) Peter learned to rely on Jehovah and became a pillar in the congregation.​—Gal. 2:9.
17. Regardless of any natural abilities we may have, what do we need to keep doing? (See also picture.)

Your answer


17 To be sound in mind, we must approach Jehovah often in prayer. We realize that we need to keep praying to Jehovah regardless of any natural abilities we may have. Therefore, especially when we are faced with important decisions, we pray to Jehovah for guidance, trusting that he knows what is best for us.




Peter learned to rely on Jehovah in prayer. We too can be sound in mind by praying for Jehovah’s help, especially when we face important decisions (See paragraph 17)c




18. How can we become more attuned to Jehovah’s way of thinking?

Your answer


18 How thankful we are that Jehovah has designed us in a way that we can reflect his qualities. (Gen. 1:26) Of course, we cannot imitate Jehovah perfectly. (Isa. 55:9) However, like Peter, we can become more attuned to Jehovah’s way of thinking. May we do so by continuing to imitate God’s way of thinking, to be humble, and to be sound in mind.
