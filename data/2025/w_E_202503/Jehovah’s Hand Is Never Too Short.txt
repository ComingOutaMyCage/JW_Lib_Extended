SONG 4 “Jehovah Is My Shepherd”

Jehovah’s Hand Is Never Too Short


“Is the hand of Jehovah too short?”​—NUM. 11:23.


FOCUS
To trust in Jehovah to provide for our material needs and to build on the trust that we already have.


 1. How did Moses show trust in Jehovah when he led the Israelites out of Egypt?

Your answer


AMONG those mentioned in the book of Hebrews as examples of faith, Moses is noteworthy. (Heb. 3:2-5; 11:23-25) He showed faith when he led the Israelites out of Egypt. He refused to be intimidated by Pharaoh and his army. Trusting in Jehovah, he led the people through the Red Sea and later into the wilderness. (Heb. 11:27-29) Most of the Israelites lost confidence in Jehovah’s ability to care for them, but Moses continued to trust in his God. Moses’ faith was not misplaced, for God miraculously provided food and water to sustain the people in the barren wilderness.a​—Ex. 15:22-25; Ps. 78:23-25.
 2. Why did God ask Moses: “Is the hand of Jehovah too short”? (Numbers 11:21-23)

Your answer


2 Despite Moses’ strong faith, however, about a year after Israel’s miraculous deliverance, he questioned Jehovah’s ability to give meat to His people. Moses could not imagine how Jehovah could provide enough meat to satisfy the millions who were camping in the desolate wilderness. In answer, Jehovah asked Moses: “Is the hand of Jehovah too short?” (Read Numbers 11:21-23.) Here, the expression “the hand of Jehovah” refers to God’s holy spirit, or his power in action. In effect, Jehovah was asking Moses, ‘Do you really think that I cannot do what I say I will?’
 3. Why should the experience of Moses and the Israelites interest us?

Your answer


3 Have you ever wondered if Jehovah will care for your material needs or those of your family? Whether you have or not, let us examine the experience of Moses and the Israelites, who lacked confidence in God’s ability to provide for them. The Scriptural principles involved will help us to build our confidence that Jehovah’s hand is never too short.
LEARN FROM MOSES AND THE ISRAELITES
 4. What may have led many to question Jehovah’s ability to provide for them materially?

Your answer


4 Consider the context. The nation of Israel and “a vast mixed company” of non-Israelites were in the great wilderness for some time as they traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land. (Ex. 12:38; Deut. 8:15) The mixed crowd grew tired of eating manna and so did many of the Israelites, who joined in making the complaint. (Num. 11:4-6) The people began to long for food that had been available in Egypt. Moses, feeling pressure from the people, seemed to think that he personally had to provide for them.​—Num. 11:13, 14.
5-6. What can we learn from how the mixed crowd influenced many Israelites?

Your answer


5 The Israelites were apparently affected by the lack of appreciation shown by the mixed crowd. We too could be influenced by the ungrateful spirit of others and become dissatisfied with what Jehovah provides. That could happen if we looked back longingly at what we once had or if we became jealous of what others have. However, we will be happier if we cultivate contentment, regardless of our circumstances.
6 The Israelites should have remembered that God had assured them that when they reached their new home, they would enjoy abundant material things. That promise was to be fulfilled in the Promised Land, not while they were traveling in the wilderness. Similarly, instead of focusing on what we may not have in this system of things, we do well to reflect on what Jehovah has promised to give us in the new world. We can also meditate on scriptures that can help us build our trust in Jehovah.
 7. Why can we be confident that Jehovah’s hand is not too short?

Your answer


7 Still, you might wonder why God asked Moses: “Is the hand of Jehovah too short?” Jehovah may have been helping Moses to think not only about the strength of His mighty hand but also about its reach. God could provide meat in abundance for the Israelites despite their being in the remote wilderness. With “a mighty hand and an outstretched arm,” God showed his power. (Ps. 136:11, 12) So when we are under trial, we should not doubt that Jehovah’s hand will reach us personally.​—Ps. 138:6, 7.
 8. How can we avoid making the same mistake that many of those in the wilderness made? (See also picture.)

Your answer


8 Jehovah soon provided meat; the people had an abundant supply of quail. The Israelites, however, did not thank God for this miracle. Rather, many were overcome with greed. Working around the clock, they collected a vast quantity of quail. Jehovah was furious with those “who showed selfish craving,” and he punished them. (Num. 11:31-34) We can learn from that example. We need to be careful not to fall prey to greed. Whether we are rich or poor, we should make it a priority to store up “treasures in heaven” by building a close friendship with Jehovah and Jesus. (Matt. 6:19, 20; Luke 16:9) When we do, we can be certain that Jehovah will provide for us.




In the wilderness, what spirit did many show, and what can we learn from that event? (See paragraph 8)




 9. Of what can we be sure as to God’s support?

Your answer


9 Jehovah extends his hand to help his people today. However, this does not mean that we will never experience material loss or that we will never be hungry.b But Jehovah will never abandon us. He will sustain us in our various trials. We may illustrate that truth by considering two situations in which we can show our trust that Jehovah will extend his hand to provide for our material needs: (1) when dealing with financial problems and (2) when planning for our future material needs.
DEALING WITH FINANCIAL PROBLEMS
10. What financial problems might we face?

Your answer


10 As the present system of things draws closer to its end, we can expect economic conditions to worsen. Political turmoil, armed conflicts, natural disasters, or new pandemics might lead to unexpected expenses or to the loss of our job, our possessions, or our home. We may have to find new work in our current location or consider moving our family to another area in order to provide for them. What can help us to make decisions that show our trust in Jehovah’s hand?
11. What can help you to deal with financial problems? (Luke 12:29-31)

Your answer


11 A primary and effective step is to take your concerns to Jehovah. (Prov. 16:3) Ask him for the wisdom you need to make good decisions and for a calm heart to avoid “being in anxious suspense” about your situation. (Read Luke 12:29-31.) Petition him to help you cultivate contentment with life’s necessities. (1 Tim. 6:7, 8) Do research in our publications on how to deal successfully with financial problems. Many have benefited from material available on jw.org that deals with economic problems.
12. What questions can help a Christian to make the best decision for his family?

Your answer


12 Some have been tempted to accept work that requires them to move away from their family, but that has often proved to be an unwise decision. Before taking up a new job, consider not only the possible financial advantages but also the spiritual cost. (Luke 14:28) Ask yourself: ‘How might my marriage be affected if I were away from my mate? What impact would this move have on my Christian association and on my ministry?’ If you have children, you also need to ask yourself this important question: ‘How will I raise my children “in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah” if I am not with them?’ (Eph. 6:4) Be guided by God’s thinking, not by that of family or friends who do not respect Scriptural principles.c Tony, who lives in western Asia, received several tempting offers to work abroad. However, after praying about the matter and discussing it with his wife, he decided to turn down the offers and instead work to reduce family expenses. Looking back, Tony says: “I’ve had the privilege of helping several people come to know Jehovah, and our children are enthusiastic about the truth. Our family has learned that as long as we live by the words of Matthew 6:33, Jehovah is going to take care of us.”
PLANNING FOR OUR FUTURE MATERIAL NEEDS
13. What reasonable steps can we take now to help us deal with our material needs when we grow older?

Your answer


13 Our trust in Jehovah’s hand could also be tested as we consider what our situation might be like when we grow older. The Bible encourages us to work hard so that we can care for our future material needs. (Prov. 6:6-11) It is reasonable, as our means allow, to set something aside for the future. Money does provide a measure of protection. (Eccl. 7:12) However, we should avoid making the quest for material things the focus of our life.
14. Why should we consider Hebrews 13:5 when planning for our future financial needs?

Your answer


14 Jesus illustrated the foolishness of storing up money without being “rich toward God.” (Luke 12:16-21) No one knows what tomorrow will bring. (Prov. 23:4, 5; Jas. 4:13-15) We face a particular challenge as followers of Christ. Jesus said that we must be ready to “give up” all our belongings to be his disciples. (Luke 14:33, ftn.) First-century Christians in Judea accepted such a loss with joy. (Heb. 10:34) In modern times, many brothers have had to sacrifice their financial security because of refusing to give allegiance to a political system. (Rev. 13:16, 17) What has helped them to do that? They have absolute confidence in Jehovah’s promise: “I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.” (Read Hebrews 13:5.) We do our best to plan for our future needs, and if unexpected events befall us, we trust in Jehovah’s support.
15. What balanced view should Christian parents have of their children? (See also picture.)

Your answer


15 In some cultures, couples primarily have a family so that the children can provide financial support to the parents when they grow old. In a sense, these couples view their children as a “retirement plan.” The Bible says that parents should care for the needs of their children. (2 Cor. 12:14) Of course, parents may need to receive some practical help as they grow old, and many children are happy to arrange for that. (1 Tim. 5:4) But Christian parents recognize that their greatest joy comes, not from raising children with a view to getting financial support from them, but from helping their children to become servants of Jehovah.​—3 John 4.




Devoted Christian couples wisely take Bible principles into consideration when making decisions about their future (See paragraph 15)d




16. How can parents prepare their children to support themselves financially? (Ephesians 4:28)

Your answer


16 By your example, teach your children to trust in Jehovah as you help them prepare to support themselves. From the time they are young, show them the value of hard work. (Prov. 29:21; read Ephesians 4:28.) As they grow, help them to do their best at school. Christian parents do well to research and apply Bible principles to help their children decide how to use education wisely. This will equip their children to support themselves and to have a full share in the Christian ministry.
17. Of what can we be certain?

Your answer


17 Jehovah’s loyal servants can count on his ability and his desire to satisfy their material needs. As we approach the end of this system of things, we can expect our confidence in Jehovah to be tested. No matter what happens, though, let us be determined to trust that Jehovah will use his power to provide for us materially. We can be certain that his mighty hand and his outstretched arm will never be too short to reach us.
