SONG 57 Preaching to All Sorts of People

Imitate Jesus’ Zeal for Preaching


“The Lord . . . sent them out by twos ahead of him into every city and place where he himself was to go.”​—LUKE 10:1.


FOCUS
Four ways in which you can imitate Jesus’ zeal in your ministry.


 1. What is one quality that sets Jehovah’s people apart from the world?

Your answer


ONE thing that sets Jehovah’s servants apart from imitation Christians is their zeala for the ministry. (Titus 2:14) At times, though, you may find it hard to feel enthusiastic about preaching. Perhaps you can identify with one hardworking elder who admitted, “Sometimes, my desire to preach is just not there.”
 2. What can sometimes make it hard to maintain zeal for the ministry?

Your answer


2 We may be more excited about engaging in other forms of sacred service than we are about sharing in the public preaching work. Why? We may see immediate results and feel a sense of accomplishment when we build and maintain theocratic buildings, assist with disaster relief, or encourage our brothers. We enjoy the atmosphere of peace and love that we experience when working with our brothers, and we know that what we do for them is appreciated. On the other hand, we may have been preaching for years in the same territory with little positive response. Or we may meet people who reject the message. We also know that as the end draws near, our message may become more unpopular. (Matt. 10:22) What can help us to maintain or even increase our zeal for the preaching work?
 3. How does Luke 13:6-9 illustrate Jesus’ zeal?

Your answer


3 We can learn something about having zeal in our preaching work by considering Jesus’ example. During his ministry, he never let up in his zeal. In fact, as time went on, he increased his activity. (Read Luke 13:6-9.) Like the vinedresser who had spent three years trying to cultivate a fig tree that did not yield any fruit, Jesus spent about three years preaching to the Jews, most of whom did not respond favorably. However, just as the vinedresser refused to give up hope on the fig tree, Jesus did not give up on people or slow down in his ministry. On the contrary, he intensified his efforts to reach their heart.
 4. What four aspects of Jesus’ example will we consider?

Your answer


4 In this article, we will discuss how Jesus showed zeal, especially during the final six months of his ministry. (See “After these things” study note on Luke 10:1.) Learning from what he taught and imitating what he did will help us to remain zealous today. Let us consider Jesus’ example in four areas: (1) He focused on Jehovah’s will, (2) he paid attention to Bible prophecy, (3) he relied on Jehovah for support, and (4) he remained positive that some would listen to him.
HE FOCUSED ON JEHOVAH’S WILL
 5. How did Jesus show that he was focused on doing God’s will?

Your answer


5 Jesus zealously preached “the good news of the Kingdom” because he knew it was the work God wanted him to do. (Luke 4:43) Jesus made the ministry his primary focus in life. Even late into his ministry, he traveled “from city to city and from village to village,” teaching others. (Luke 13:22) He also trained additional disciples to work with him as preachers.​—Luke 10:1.
 6. How does the preaching work relate to other assignments we might have? (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Today, too, preaching the good news is the primary work that Jehovah and Jesus want us to do. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) There is a direct connection between the preaching work and other theocratic assignments. For example, we build theocratic facilities or serve at Bethel to support the needs in the field. We provide disaster relief not only to render aid to our brothers and sisters but also to help them resume their spiritual routine, which includes preaching. When we recognize the importance of the preaching work and remember that it is the main work that Jehovah wants us to do, we will be motivated to have a regular share in the ministry. János, an elder in Hungary, says, “I remind myself that no theocratic activity can replace the preaching work; it is our primary assignment.”




Today, preaching the good news is the primary work that Jehovah and Jesus want us to do (See paragraph 6)




 7. Why does Jehovah want us to keep on preaching? (1 Timothy 2:3, 4)

Your answer


7 We can strengthen our zeal for the ministry by viewing people as Jehovah does. He wants as many as possible to hear the good news and to respond to it. (Read 1 Timothy 2:3, 4.) To that end, he trains us to be more effective in sharing this lifesaving message. For example, the brochure Love People​—Make Disciples provides practical suggestions that can help us to start conversations with the goal of making disciples. Even if people do not respond now, they may have an opportunity to do so before the end of the great tribulation. What we say to them now may well be what moves them to respond in the future. But that can only happen if we keep on preaching.
HE PAID ATTENTION TO BIBLE PROPHECY
 8. How did knowing Bible prophecy influence the way Jesus used his time?

Your answer


8 Jesus understood how Bible prophecies would be fulfilled. He knew that his ministry would last just three and a half years. (Dan. 9:26, 27) He also knew what was prophesied concerning when and how he would die. (Luke 18:31-34) Jesus let what he knew influence how he used his time. As a result, he preached with zeal in order to finish the work he had been given to do.
 9. Why do Bible prophecies motivate us to preach with zeal?

Your answer


9 Our understanding of Bible prophecy can move us to preach with zeal. We know that the time left for this system is short. We recognize that current events and the attitude of people today reflect what the Bible foretold would mark the last days. We perceive how the rivalry between the Anglo-American World Power and Russia and its allies fulfills the prophecy about the king of the south and the king of the north “in the time of the end.” (Dan. 11:40) We also understand that the Anglo-American World Power is represented by the feet of the image described at Daniel 2:43-45. We are convinced that as the prophecy indicates, soon​—very soon—​God’s Kingdom will destroy human governments. All these prophecies reveal where we are in the stream of time and spur us on to preach with a sense of urgency.
10. In what other ways can Bible prophecies stimulate our zeal?

Your answer


10 Bible prophecies also provide us with a message that we are eager to share. “Jehovah’s heartwarming promises of a better future motivate me to share the truth with others,” says Carrie, a sister serving in the Dominican Republic. She adds: “When I see what people are dealing with today, I realize that these promises are, not just for me, but for them too.” Bible prophecies encourage us not to hold back because we know that Jehovah is behind our preaching work. Leila, who lives in Hungary, says: “Isaiah 11:6-9 motivates me to share the good news even with those who do not look like they will accept it. I know that anyone can change with Jehovah’s help.” And Christopher, a brother from Zambia, says: “As Mark 13:10 foretold, the good news is spreading worldwide, and I feel honored to help in fulfilling this prophecy.” What Bible prophecies motivate you to keep preaching?
HE RELIED ON JEHOVAH FOR SUPPORT
11. Why did Jesus need to rely on Jehovah for help to keep zealously preaching? (Luke 12:49, 53)

Your answer


11 Jesus relied on Jehovah for support to keep zealously preaching. Although Jesus was tactful, he knew that the good news of the Kingdom would cause heated controversy and bring on strong opposition. (Read Luke 12:49, 53.) As a result of Jesus’ preaching, the religious leaders repeatedly tried to kill him. (John 8:59; 10:31, 39) But Jesus kept preaching because he knew that Jehovah was with him. He said: “I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me. . . . He did not abandon me to myself, because I always do the things pleasing to him.”​—John 8:16, 29.
12. How did Jesus prepare his disciples to keep preaching in the face of opposition?

Your answer


12 Jesus reminded his disciples that they could rely on Jehovah for support. He repeatedly assured them that Jehovah would help them even when they faced persecution. (Matt. 10:18-20; Luke 12:11, 12) Accordingly, he urged them to be cautious. (Matt. 10:16; Luke 10:3) He instructed them not to force their message on those who did not want to listen. (Luke 10:10, 11) And he told them to flee if they were persecuted. (Matt. 10:23) Although Jesus was zealous and trusted in Jehovah, he did not needlessly expose himself to danger.​—John 11:53, 54.
13. Why can you be certain that Jehovah will help you?

Your answer


13 We need Jehovah’s help to keep zealously preaching in the face of opposition today. (Rev. 12:17) Why can you be certain that Jehovah will support you? Consider Jesus’ prayer recorded in John chapter 17. Jesus asked Jehovah to watch over the apostles, and Jehovah answered that request. The book of Acts reports how he helped the apostles to preach zealously despite persecution. In his prayer, Jesus also asked Jehovah to watch over those who would put faith in the apostles’ preaching. That includes you. Jehovah has not stopped answering Jesus’ prayer; He will help you just as He helped the apostles.​—John 17:11, 15, 20.
14. How do we know that we will be able to keep preaching with zeal? (See also picture.)

Your answer


14 Even if it turns out to be more difficult to preach the good news with zeal as the end draws close, we will receive all the support we need. (Luke 21:12-15) Like Jesus and his disciples, we let people decide whether to listen or not, and we avoid needless conflict. Even when our work is restricted, our brothers have been able to keep declaring the good news because they rely on Jehovah, not on their own strength. Just as in the first century Jehovah gave power to his servants, today he gives us power so that “the preaching might be fully accomplished” to his satisfaction. (2 Tim. 4:17) You can be certain that if you rely on Jehovah, you will be able to keep preaching with zeal.




Even when our work is restricted, zealous publishers find discreet ways to share their faith (See paragraph 14)b




HE REMAINED POSITIVE
15. What shows that Jesus had a positive view of the ministry?

Your answer


15 Jesus maintained a positive attitude about the preaching work. That helped him to stay enthusiastic about his ministry. For example, late in 30 C.E., Jesus saw that many were ready to respond to his preaching activity, and he likened them to a ripe field ready to be harvested. (John 4:35) About a year later, he told his disciples: “The harvest is great.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) And later he again emphasized: “The harvest is great . . . Beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Luke 10:2) Jesus never lost sight of the potential for people to respond to the good news, and he rejoiced when they did.​—Luke 10:21.
16. How did Jesus’ illustrations convey a positive view of the ministry? (Luke 13:18-21) (See also picture.)

Your answer


16 Jesus taught his disciples to keep a positive view of their message, which would encourage them to maintain their zeal. For example, consider two of his illustrations. (Read Luke 13:18-21.) Jesus used a mustard grain to teach that the Kingdom message would expand in an amazing way and have unstoppable growth. And he used leaven to illustrate how the Kingdom message would spread widely and cause changes that might not be immediately apparent. Consequently, Jesus helped his disciples to see that the message they preached would indeed have success.




Like Jesus, we remain positive that some will respond to the preaching work (See paragraph 16)




17. What reasons do we have to remain positive about the ministry?

Your answer


17 We are moved to keep zealously preaching by considering what is being accomplished worldwide today. Each year, millions of interested ones attend the Memorial and study the Bible with us. Hundreds of thousands get baptized and join us in the preaching work. We do not know how many may yet respond to our preaching work, but we do know that Jehovah is gathering a great crowd who will survive the coming great tribulation. (Rev. 7:9, 14) The Master of the harvest continues to see potential in the field, so we have good reason to keep preaching.
18. What do we want others to observe about us?

Your answer


18 Jesus’ disciples have always been identified by their zealous preaching. When people witnessed the outspokenness of the apostles, “they began to realize that they had been with Jesus.” (Acts 4:13) As people observe us in the ministry, may they see that we too have been influenced by Jesus’ zealous example.
