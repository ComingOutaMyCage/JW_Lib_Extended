In the Bible, “walking” sometimes refers to the way a person chooses to live his life. When a person walks just by sight, he makes decisions based solely on what he can see, hear, and feel with his physical senses. On the other hand, when a person walks by faith, he makes decisions based on his trust in Jehovah God. His actions show that he is convinced that God will reward him, that he will benefit from following Jehovah’s advice found in His Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:66-19:119:66" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 119:66;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:6</a>.</p>

Basically, it comes down to this: What factors guide our decisions? Are we guided only by the things we can see? Or are we guided by our trust in and advice from Jehovah? Let us consider how we can continue walking by faith in three important areas: when choosing employment, when choosing a marriage mate, and when receiving theocratic direction. For each, we will discuss factors that we should consider in order to make good decisions.</p>

They may allow an employee to care for his day-to-day expenses and to put something aside for the future. With other jobs, the pay may be more limited, allowing the worker to provide only the essentials for his family.

He was also pressured to cover up dishonest activities. Trésor wanted to quit, but he worried about being unemployed. What helped him?

So I resigned.” He concludes: “Many employers think that for a well-paid job, a person will sacrifice anything, including family life and spiritual activities. I am happy that I preserved my relationship with Jehovah and with my family. A year later, Jehovah helped me find a stable job that allows me to live modestly and have more time for Christian <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>activities.

Her work brought her into repeated contact with a non-Witness man who began to show interest in her. Rosa was attracted to him. She says: “He seemed like a very good man. He volunteered in his community and had a healthy lifestyle. I liked how he treated me. He had what I wanted in a husband except he was not a Witness.” She continues: “It was difficult to say no to him because it was something that I wanted emotionally. At that time, I felt somewhat alone and I wanted to get married, but I hadn’t been able to find someone in the truth.” Yet, Rosa did not focus only on what she could see. She contemplated how this decision would affect her friendship with Jehovah. Thus, she ended all contact with the man and kept busy in theocratic activities. Shortly thereafter, she was invited to attend the School for Kingdom Evangelizers, and she now serves as a special pioneer.

In Peru, although the Spanish language is widely spoken, many householders speak indigenous languages. One of these is Quechua.

But we must keep walking by faith in all areas of our life, such as when choosing entertainment or recreation and when making decisions about education or child-rearing. Whatever decisions we have to make, we should be guided not only by what we can see but also by our relationship with Jehovah, his advice, and his promise to take care of us. If we do, we will be able to “walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:5-33:4:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mic. 4:5</a>.</p>
