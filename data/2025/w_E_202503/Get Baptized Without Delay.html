Before the Samaritans could get baptized, they had to gain a more complete knowledge of God’s Word.

After her mother got baptized, Anna began to study the Bible at age 9 with her father’s approval. However, this caused problems with her extended family, who all lived together with Anna’s family. The relatives viewed it as a disgrace for someone to leave the religion of the forefathers. When Anna was 12 years old, she asked her father for approval to get baptized. He wanted to know if it was her personal decision or if she was being pressured by someone. She responded, “I love Jehovah.” Her father agreed to her baptism. Afterward, Anna faced various forms of ridicule and mistreatment. One of her relatives told her, “You would be better off living an immoral lifestyle and smoking than being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” How did Anna cope? She said, “Jehovah helped me to be strong, and my mother and father supported me very much.” Anna keeps a record of the specific times when she has felt Jehovah’s hand in her life.

Many who lived there pursued lifestyles that God does not approve. Clearly, such a climate posed a real challenge for anyone who would accept the good news. Yet, when the apostle Paul came to that city and preached the good news about the Christ, “many of the Corinthians who heard began to believe and be baptized.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:7-44:18:11" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Acts 18:7-11</a>) Then the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to Paul in a vision and said: “I have many people in this city.” So Paul continued preaching there for a year and a half.</p>

She said: “During my teens, my power was prayer. Jehovah knew that I wanted to do the right thing, and he was always helping me and guiding me.” Monika got baptized at age 16. Are there practices you need to abandon in order to serve Jehovah acceptably? Continue asking him for the power to make changes.

That is true no matter what obstacles to baptism you are facing. Jesus said to a group of his first-century disciples: “If you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:20-40:17:20" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Matt. 17:20</a>) Those present to hear this had been with Jesus for just a few years, so their faith was still growing. But Jesus assured them that if they developed sufficient faith, Jehovah would help them to move mountainlike obstacles. And Jehovah will help you to do the same!</p>
