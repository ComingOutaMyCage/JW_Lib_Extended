Notice that our love for Jehovah involves our heart, which includes our desires, feelings, and emotions. It also involves our whole-souled devotion and our strength​—including our energy. However, loving Jehovah also involves our <strong><em>mind,</em></strong> which includes the way we think about matters. Of course, we can never fully understand all of Jehovah’s thinking. But we can better understand God’s thinking by studying “the mind of Christ” because Jesus perfectly reflects the thinking of his Father.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:16-46:2:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:16</a> and study note “<a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://c/E:1001070150/2:16">we do have the mind of Christ</a>.”</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Consider one occasion when Peter did not reflect Jehovah’s thinking on matters. Jesus had told his apostles that he would have to go to Jerusalem, be handed over to the religious leaders there, endure torture, and then be put to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:21-40:16:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21</a>) Peter may have found it hard to accept that Jehovah would allow Jesus​—the hope of Israel and the promised Messiah—​to be put to death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:16-40:16:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 16:16</a>) So Peter took Jesus aside and said: “Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this happen to you at all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:22-40:16:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 16:22</a>) Because Peter did not reflect Jehovah’s thinking on the matter, he was not thinking in agreement with Jesus.</p>

The time had arrived for uncircumcised Gentiles to become part of God’s people. Peter was assigned to preach to the Gentile Cornelius, who would be among the first of this new group of worshippers. Jews had very little to do with Gentiles, so it is not surprising that Peter needed help to prepare for his assignment. When Peter discerned God’s will in this matter, he adjusted his viewpoint.
