Why? We may see immediate results and feel a sense of accomplishment when we build and maintain theocratic buildings, assist with disaster relief, or encourage our brothers. We enjoy the atmosphere of peace and love that we experience when working with our brothers, and we know that what we do for them is appreciated. On the other hand, we may have been preaching for years in the same territory with little positive response. Or we may meet people who reject the message. We also know that as the end draws near, our message may become more unpopular.

During his ministry, he never let up in his zeal. In fact, as time went on, he increased his activity. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:6-42:13:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 13:6-9</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Like the vinedresser who had spent three years trying to cultivate a fig tree that did not yield any fruit, Jesus spent about three years preaching to the Jews, most of whom did not respond favorably. However, just as the vinedresser refused to give up hope on the fig tree, Jesus did not give up on people or slow down in his ministry. On the contrary, he intensified his efforts to reach their heart.</p>

Learning from what he taught and imitating what he did will help us to remain zealous today. Let us consider Jesus’ example in four areas: (1) He focused on Jehovah’s will, (2) he paid attention to Bible prophecy, (3) he relied on Jehovah for support, and (4) he remained positive that some would listen to him.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Jesus zealously preached “the good news of the Kingdom” because he knew it was the work God wanted him to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) Jesus made the ministry his primary focus in life. Even late into his ministry, he traveled “from city to city and from village to village,” teaching others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:22-42:13:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 13:22</a>) He also trained additional disciples to work with him as preachers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:1-42:10:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 10:1</a>.</p>

For example, we build theocratic facilities or serve at Bethel to support the needs in the field. We provide disaster relief not only to render aid to our brothers and sisters but also to help them resume their spiritual routine, which includes preaching. When we recognize the importance of the preaching work and remember that it is the main work that Jehovah wants us to do, we will be motivated to have a regular share in the ministry. János, an elder in Hungary, says, “I remind myself that no theocratic activity can replace the preaching work; it is our primary assignment.”</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[52]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> We can strengthen our zeal for the ministry by viewing people as Jehovah does.

For example, the brochure <em>Love People​—Make Disciples</em> provides practical suggestions that can help us to start conversations with the goal of making disciples. Even if people do not respond now, they may have an opportunity to do so before the end of the great tribulation. What we say to them now may well be what moves them to respond in the future. But that can only happen if we keep on preaching.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:26-27:9:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 9:26, 27</a>) He also knew what was prophesied concerning when and how he would die. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:31-42:18:34" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 18:31-34</a>) Jesus let what he knew influence how he used his time.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[56]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Our understanding of Bible prophecy can move us to preach with zeal. We know that the time left for this system is short. We recognize that current events and the attitude of people today reflect what the Bible foretold would mark the last days. We perceive how the rivalry between the Anglo-American World Power and Russia and its allies fulfills the prophecy about the king of the south and the king of the north “in the time of the end.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:40-27:11:40" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 11:40</a>) We also understand that the Anglo-American World Power is represented by the feet of the image described at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:43-27:2:45" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 2:43-45</a>. We are convinced that as the prophecy indicates, soon​—very soon—​God’s Kingdom will destroy human governments. All these prophecies reveal where we are in the stream of time and spur us on to preach with a sense of urgency.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[58]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Bible prophecies also provide us with a message that we are eager to share. “Jehovah’s heartwarming promises <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>of a better future motivate me to share the truth with others,” says Carrie, a sister serving in the Dominican Republic. She adds: “When I see what people are dealing with today, I realize that these promises are, not just for me, but for them too.” Bible prophecies encourage us not to hold back because we know that Jehovah is behind our preaching work. Leila, who lives in Hungary, says: “<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9</a> motivates me to share the good news even with those who do not look like they will accept it. I know that anyone can change with Jehovah’s help.” And Christopher, a brother from Zambia, says: “As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a> foretold, the good news is spreading worldwide, and I feel honored to help in fulfilling this prophecy.” What Bible prophecies motivate you to keep preaching?</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[68]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Jesus maintained a positive attitude about the preaching work. That helped him to stay enthusiastic about his ministry. For example, late in 30 C.E., Jesus saw that many were ready to respond to his preaching activity, and he likened <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>them to a ripe field ready to be harvested. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:35-43:4:35" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 4:35</a>) About a year later, he told his disciples: “The harvest is great.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:37-40:9:38" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 9:37, 38</a>) And later he again emphasized: “The harvest is great . . . Beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:2-42:10:2" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 10:2</a>) Jesus never lost sight of the potential for people to respond to the good news, and he rejoiced when they did.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:21-42:10:21" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 10:21</a>.</p>

For example, consider two of his illustrations. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:18-42:13:21" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 13:18-21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jesus used a mustard grain to teach that the Kingdom message would expand in an amazing way and have unstoppable growth. And he used leaven to illustrate how the Kingdom message would spread widely and cause changes that might not be immediately apparent. Consequently, Jesus helped his disciples to see that the message they preached would indeed have success.</p>
