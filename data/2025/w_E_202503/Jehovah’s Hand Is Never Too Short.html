<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Consider the context. The nation of Israel and “a vast mixed company” of non-Israelites were in the great wilderness for some time as they traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:38-2:12:38" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 12:38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:15-5:8:15" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 8:15</a>) The mixed crowd grew tired of eating manna and so did many of the Israelites, who joined in making the complaint. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:4-4:11:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Num. 11:4-6</a>) The people began to long for food that had been available in Egypt. Moses, feeling pressure from the people, seemed to think that he personally had to provide for them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:13-4:11:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Num. 11:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The Israelites were apparently affected by the lack of appreciation shown by the mixed crowd. We too could be influenced by the ungrateful spirit of others and become dissatisfied with what Jehovah provides. That could happen if we looked back longingly at what we once had or if we became jealous of what others have. However, we will be happier if we cultivate contentment, regardless of our circumstances.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> The Israelites should have remembered that God had assured them that when they reached their new home, they would enjoy abundant material things. That promise was to be fulfilled in the Promised Land, not while they were traveling in the wilderness. Similarly, instead of focusing on what we may not have in this system of things, we do well to reflect on what Jehovah has promised to give us in the new world. We can also meditate on scriptures that can help us build our trust in Jehovah.</p>

God could provide meat in abundance for the Israelites despite their being in the remote wilderness. With “a mighty hand and <strong><em>an outstretched arm,”</em></strong> God showed his power.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:31-4:11:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Num. 11:31-34</a>) We can learn from that example. We need to be careful not to fall prey to greed. Whether we are rich or poor, we should make it a priority to store up “treasures in heaven” by building a close friendship with Jehovah and Jesus.

We can be certain that his mighty hand and his outstretched arm will never be too short to reach us.</p>
