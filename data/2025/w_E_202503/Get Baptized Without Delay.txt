SONG 51 To God We Are Dedicated!

Get Baptized Without Delay


“Why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized.”​—ACTS 22:16.


FOCUS
Find the strength you need to progress to baptism by considering the examples of the Samaritans, Saul of Tarsus, Cornelius, and the Corinthians.


 1. What are some good reasons to get baptized?

Your answer


DO YOU love Jehovah God, the one who has given you every good gift, even life itself? Do you want to show your love for him? The best way to do so is to dedicate yourself to him and then symbolize your dedication by water baptism. These steps make you part of Jehovah’s family. As a result, your Father and Friend will guide you and care for you because you will belong to him. (Ps. 73:24; Isa. 43:1, 2) Dedication and baptism also give you the prospect of enjoying endless life.​—1 Pet. 3:21.
 2. What will we consider in this article?

Your answer


2 Is something holding you back from getting baptized? If so, you are not alone. Millions before you have had to make changes in their conduct and in their way of thinking in order to qualify for baptism. They are now serving Jehovah with joy and zeal. What can you learn from some who got baptized in the first century? Let us consider obstacles they faced and see what we can learn from their example.
THE SAMARITANS GOT BAPTIZED
 3. What obstacles to baptism may some Samaritans have faced?

Your answer


3 The Samaritans in Jesus’ day belonged to a religious sect that was centered in the vicinity of ancient Shechem and Samaria, north of Judea. Before the Samaritans could get baptized, they had to gain a more complete knowledge of God’s Word. The Samaritans accepted as inspired only the first five books of the Bible​—Genesis through Deuteronomy—​and possibly the book of Joshua. The Samaritans did, however, expect the Messiah to come, based on God’s promise recorded at Deuteronomy 18:18, 19. (John 4:25) In order to get baptized, they had to accept Jesus as the promised Messiah. “Many of the Samaritans” did just that. (John 4:39) Others may have had to overcome the deep-seated prejudice that existed between Samaritans and Jews.​—Luke 9:52-54.
 4. According to Acts 8:5, 6, 14, how did some Samaritans respond to Philip’s preaching?

Your answer


4 What helped the Samaritans to get baptized? When Philip the evangelizer preached “the Christ to them,” some Samaritans “accepted the word of God.” (Read Acts 8:5, 6, 14.) Philip had a Jewish background, but they did not object. Perhaps they recalled verses from the Pentateuch indicating that God is not partial. (Deut. 10:17-19) In any event, they paid “attention to what Philip said” about the Christ, and they recognized the clear evidence that God was backing Philip. He was also performing many signs, which included curing the sick and expelling demons.​—Acts 8:7.
 5. What lessons can you learn from the Samaritans?

Your answer


5 Those Samaritans could have allowed prejudice or a lack of knowledge to prevent them from progressing. But they did not let that happen. The Samaritans did not delay getting baptized after they were convinced that Philip had taught them the truth. The Bible account explains: “When they believed Philip, who was declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were getting baptized.” (Acts 8:12) Are you convinced that God’s Word is the truth and that Jehovah’s Witnesses overcome prejudice and endeavor to show one another genuine love​—the identifying mark of true Christians? (John 13:35) Then take decisive action, confident that Jehovah will bless you.
 6. How can you benefit from Ruben’s example?

Your answer


6 Ruben, from Germany, grew up in a family of Witnesses. However, as a youth, he had doubts about Jehovah’s existence. How did he overcome his doubts? Realizing that he lacked knowledge, he decided to do something about it. He said: “In my personal study, I needed to face my doubts. I had to study the topic of evolution several times.” He read the book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? That publication had a tremendous effect on Ruben. He thought to himself: ‘Wow! Jehovah is real.’ And during a visit to world headquarters, Ruben deepened his appreciation for the miracle of our united international brotherhood. When he returned to Germany, Ruben got baptized at age 17. If you have doubts about what you have learned, face them by doing research in our publications. Doubts can be overcome with “accurate knowledge.” (Eph. 4:13, 14) And as you hear reports about the love and unity among Jehovah’s people in other parts of the world and see evidence of it in your own congregation, your appreciation for our worldwide brotherhood will grow.
SAUL OF TARSUS GOT BAPTIZED
 7. What thinking did Saul have to correct?

Your answer


7 Consider the example of Saul of Tarsus. He was progressing well in Judaism and had an impressive Jewish background. (Gal. 1:13, 14; Phil. 3:5) At a time when many Jews viewed Christians as apostates, Saul furiously persecuted them. He wrongly thought that he was doing God’s will. (Acts 8:3; 9:1, 2; 26:9-11) In order to accept Jesus and get baptized as a Christian, Saul himself would have to be willing to become a target of persecution.
 8. (a) What helped Saul to get baptized? (b) According to Acts 22:12-16, how did Ananias help Saul? (See also picture.)

Your answers


8 What helped Saul to get baptized? When the glorified Lord Jesus appeared to him, Saul was blinded. (Acts 9:3-9) For three days, he fasted and no doubt meditated on what he had just experienced. Yes, Saul became convinced that Jesus was the Messiah and that his followers practiced the true religion. Saul must have been struck with remorse for his share in Stephen’s death! (Acts 22:20) At the end of the three days, a disciple named Ananias kindly approached Saul, healed his blindness, and encouraged him to get baptized without delay. (Read Acts 22:12-16.) Saul humbly accepted the help and embraced a new way of life.​—Acts 9:17, 18.




Will you accept encouragement to get baptized, just as Saul did? (See paragraph 8)




 9. What lessons can you learn from Saul?

Your answer


9 There are lessons that we can learn from Saul. He could have allowed pride or fear of man to prevent him from getting baptized. But he did not allow that to happen. Saul humbly changed his life course when he accepted the truth about the Christ. (Acts 26:14, 19) Saul was willing to become a Christian even though he knew that he would be persecuted. (Acts 9:15, 16; 20:22, 23) After his baptism, he continued relying on Jehovah to help him endure various trials. (2 Cor. 4:7-10) Your getting baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses may lead to tests of faith or trials, but you will have help. You can be confident of the unfailing support of God and of Christ.​—Phil. 4:13.
10. How can you benefit from Anna’s example?

Your answer


10 Anna grew up in a Kurdish family in Eastern Europe. After her mother got baptized, Anna began to study the Bible at age 9 with her father’s approval. However, this caused problems with her extended family, who all lived together with Anna’s family. The relatives viewed it as a disgrace for someone to leave the religion of the forefathers. When Anna was 12 years old, she asked her father for approval to get baptized. He wanted to know if it was her personal decision or if she was being pressured by someone. She responded, “I love Jehovah.” Her father agreed to her baptism. Afterward, Anna faced various forms of ridicule and mistreatment. One of her relatives told her, “You would be better off living an immoral lifestyle and smoking than being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” How did Anna cope? She said, “Jehovah helped me to be strong, and my mother and father supported me very much.” Anna keeps a record of the specific times when she has felt Jehovah’s hand in her life. She refers to it from time to time so that she does not forget how Jehovah has helped her. If you fear opposition, remember that Jehovah will help you too.​—Heb. 13:6.
CORNELIUS GOT BAPTIZED
11. What circumstances did Cornelius face?

Your answer


11 The Bible also provides the example of Cornelius. He was “a centurion,” that is, a commander of about 100 soldiers in the Roman army. (Acts 10:1, ftn.) As such, he may have had significant social and military status. He “made many gifts of mercy to the people.” (Acts 10:2) Jehovah sent the apostle Peter to declare the good news to him. Did Cornelius’ position cause him to delay getting baptized?
12. What helped Cornelius to get baptized?

Your answer


12 What helped Cornelius to get baptized? We read that he “feared God together with all his household.” And Cornelius made supplication to God continually. (Acts 10:2) When Peter declared the good news to Cornelius, he and his family accepted Christ and promptly got baptized. (Acts 10:47, 48) Cornelius was no doubt willing to make whatever adjustments were required of him so that he could worship Jehovah together with his family.​—Josh. 24:15; Acts 10:24, 33.
13. What lessons can you learn from Cornelius?

Your answer


13 Like Saul, Cornelius could have allowed his position to prevent him from becoming a Christian. But he did not allow that to happen. Does accepting the truth require that you make significant changes in your life? If so, Jehovah will be your Helper. He will bless your determination to serve him in harmony with Bible principles.
14. How can you benefit from Tsuyoshi’s example?

Your answer


14 Tsuyoshi, from Japan, had to make a change in his employment in order to qualify for baptism. He was the assistant to the headmaster of the Ikenobo school of flower arrangement. When the headmaster was unable to attend funerals, Tsuyoshi often represented him in Buddhist rituals. However, when Tsuyoshi learned the truth about death, this practice became an obstacle to baptism. He made a personal decision not to share in Buddhist rites. (2 Cor. 6:15, 16) Tsuyoshi spoke to the headmaster about the subject. The result? Tsuyoshi was able to keep his job without having to participate in the rituals. He got baptized about a year after he began studying the Bible.a If you need to adjust your employment in order to please God, be assured that he will provide what you and your family need.​—Ps. 127:2; Matt. 6:33.
THE CORINTHIANS GOT BAPTIZED
15. What obstacles to baptism did the Corinthians face?

Your answer


15 Ancient Corinth was known for its materialism and lack of moral restraint. Many who lived there pursued lifestyles that God does not approve. Clearly, such a climate posed a real challenge for anyone who would accept the good news. Yet, when the apostle Paul came to that city and preached the good news about the Christ, “many of the Corinthians who heard began to believe and be baptized.” (Acts 18:7-11) Then the Lord Jesus Christ appeared to Paul in a vision and said: “I have many people in this city.” So Paul continued preaching there for a year and a half.
16. What helped some in Corinth to overcome obstacles to baptism? (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5)

Your answer


16 What helped the Corinthians to get baptized? (Read 2 Corinthians 10:4, 5.) God’s Word and his powerful holy spirit helped them to make drastic changes in their life. (Heb. 4:12) Those in Corinth who accepted the good news about Christ were able to abandon such habits and practices as drunkenness, thievery, and homosexuality.​—1 Cor. 6:9-11.b
17. What can you learn from the Corinthians?

Your answer


17 Note that although some in Corinth had deeply entrenched habits to overcome, they did not conclude that it would be too difficult for them to become Christians. They put forth diligent effort to get on the cramped road leading to everlasting life. (Matt. 7:13, 14) Are you struggling to overcome a bad habit or a wrong practice in order to get baptized? Never give up the fight! Beg Jehovah for his holy spirit to help you to resist craving what is bad.
18. How can you benefit from Monika’s example?

Your answer


18 Monika, from the country of Georgia, worked hard to abandon unclean speech and improper entertainment in order to progress to baptism. She said: “During my teens, my power was prayer. Jehovah knew that I wanted to do the right thing, and he was always helping me and guiding me.” Monika got baptized at age 16. Are there practices you need to abandon in order to serve Jehovah acceptably? Continue asking him for the power to make changes. Jehovah generously provides his holy spirit.​—John 3:34.
YOUR FAITH CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS
19. What can help you overcome mountainlike obstacles? (See also picture.)

Your answer


19 Be assured that Jehovah loves you and wants you to be part of his family. That is true no matter what obstacles to baptism you are facing. Jesus said to a group of his first-century disciples: “If you have faith the size of a mustard grain, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” (Matt. 17:20) Those present to hear this had been with Jesus for just a few years, so their faith was still growing. But Jesus assured them that if they developed sufficient faith, Jehovah would help them to move mountainlike obstacles. And Jehovah will help you to do the same!




Be assured that Jehovah loves you and wants you to be part of his family (See paragraph 19)c




20. How have the examples of first-century and modern-day Christians mentioned in this article motivated you?

Your answer
