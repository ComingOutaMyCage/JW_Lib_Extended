7. You Can Thrive in Your Ministry Despite Being Shy


(15 min.) Discussion.

Would you describe yourself as someone who is shy? Do you generally prefer to go unnoticed? Do you get a knot in your stomach at the thought of talking to others? At times, being shy can hold us back from doing things that we would like to do. However, many who have struggled with shyness have been able to reach out and even thrive in their ministry. What can we learn from their example?
