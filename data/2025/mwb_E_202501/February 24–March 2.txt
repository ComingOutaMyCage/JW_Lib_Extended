(15 min.) Discussion.

Young ones, do you like the idea of searching for a hidden treasure? If so, the Bible invites you to hunt for the most valuable treasure in the universe​—the knowledge of God! (Pr 2:4, 5) You can find this treasure by making time to read the Bible regularly and by digging into the accounts that you read. Doing so can be enjoyable and rewarding!
