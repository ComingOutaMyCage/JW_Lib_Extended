7. Be Prepared for Situations That Require Medical or Surgical Care


(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah promises to be “a help that is readily found in times of distress.” (Ps 46:1) Situations that require medical or surgical care can be distressing. However, Jehovah has provided everything we need to be prepared for such events. For example, his organization has provided the durable power of attorney (DPA), the Identity Card,a and other medical information documentsb as well as the Hospital Liaison Committees (HLC). These provisions help us to obey God’s law regarding blood.​—Ac 15:28, 29.

  Why is it best to contact the HLC as soon as possible in any situation that requires a hospital stay, a surgery, or a therapy, such as cancer treatment, even if it seems that the situation might not involve the blood issue?

Your answer
