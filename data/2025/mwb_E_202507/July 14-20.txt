7. Be Patient, but Not Permissive


(15 min.) Discussion.

Raising children requires much patience. Parents must give their children regular attention and unhurried time. (De 6:6, 7) In order to know what is in their children’s hearts, parents must draw them out and then really listen to what they say. (Pr 20:5) Parents may also have to repeat their instruction many times before their children understand and apply it.
Patient parents, however, are not permissive. Jehovah has given them the authority to set boundaries and then to give needed discipline when their children disobey.​—Pr 6:20; 23:13.
Read Ephesians 4:31. Then ask the audience:
  Why should parents not discipline their children in anger?
