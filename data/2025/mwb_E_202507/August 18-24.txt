7. “A Brother Who Is Born for Times of Distress”


(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah has provided a worldwide Christian brotherhood wherein we can find loving friends. Although we may be friendly with many in the congregation, how many of them are our close friends? Strong friendships are built on understanding, trust, heart-to-heart communication, shared experiences, and unselfish actions. Therefore, building and maintaining friendships takes time and effort.
Read Proverbs 17:17. Then ask the audience:
  Why is it wise to build close friendships now before the great tribulation begins?

Your answer




Read 2 Corinthians 6:12, 13. Then ask the audience:
  How can applying these verses help us to make friends?

Your answer











Play the VIDEO DRAMATIZATION “There Is an Appointed Time for Everything”​—Building Friendships Takes Time. Then ask the audience:
  What did you learn about friendships from this dramatization?

Your answer




You can begin planting the seed of friendship with a smile or a friendly greeting and then water it by showing personal interest. Be patient and let it grow as you spend time together. The result may be a friendship that lasts for an eternity.
