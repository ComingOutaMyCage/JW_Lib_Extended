TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. Be a Wise Person, Not a Ridiculer


(10 min.)

A ridiculer does not accept loving counsel but instead resents the counselor (Pr 9:7, 8a; w22.02 9 ¶4)
A wise person appreciates the counsel and the counselor (Pr 9:8b, 9; w22.02 12 ¶12-14; w01 5/15 30 ¶1-2)
The wise person will benefit, but the ridiculer will suffer (Pr 9:12; w01 5/15 30 ¶5)
