7. Don’t Let Your Tongue Be a Peace Wrecker


(15 min.) Discussion.

Because we are imperfect, we will stumble in our speech. (Jas 3:8) However, if we are mindful of common pitfalls, this will help us to avoid saying things that we will later regret. Here are some types of speech that can wreck the peace of the congregation:
  Inappropriate boasting. This speech is self-praise and can stir up competition and envy.​—Pr 27:2

  Dishonest speech. This speech is not limited to telling outright lies but includes speech that is intentionally misleading. Even a little dishonesty can destroy trust and harm our reputation.​—Ec 10:1

  Harmful gossip. This speech is idle talk about people and their lives that distorts the facts or reveals private matters. (1Ti 5:13) It can lead to quarreling and divisions

  Angry speech. This speech is an uncontrolled venting of our feelings against someone who upsets us. (Eph 4:26) It can cause hurt.​—Pr 29:22









Play the VIDEO “Put Away” Peace Wreckers​—Excerpt. Then ask the audience:
  What did you learn about how easily our speech can disrupt the peace of the congregation?
