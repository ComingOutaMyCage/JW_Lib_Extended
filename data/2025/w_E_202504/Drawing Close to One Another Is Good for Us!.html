(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>) That includes being kind even toward those who do not share our beliefs.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:21-43:14:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 14:21</a>) He wants us to imitate him.

On that basis alone, they may conclude that they have found the truth. Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Consider the experience of Chaithra, a university student who was studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses. She accepted an invitation to attend a regional convention. After attending the first day in person, she told her Bible teacher: “I have never been hugged by my parents. But at your convention, I received 52 hugs in just one day! I felt Jehovah’s love through this <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>spiritual family. I want to be part of that family.” Chaithra continued to progress and got baptized in 2024.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Drawing closer to our brothers and sisters can serve as a protection.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32</a>) There is no need to wait for your brother or sister to draw closer to you. You can “take the lead” in doing so.
