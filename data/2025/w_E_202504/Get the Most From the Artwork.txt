Get the Most From the Artwork




Our publications are filled with artwork that teaches important points. How can you get the most from these visual aids?
  Preview the artwork before reading the article. The images may pique your curiosity and motivate you to read the article. Just as with any appetizing dish, the eyes “taste” first. So ask yourself, ‘What do I see?’​—Amos 7:7, 8.

  As you read the article, think about why the artwork was chosen. Read the captions or picture descriptions if provided. Consider how the artwork relates to the subject being discussed and to your own life.

  After reading, use the artwork to review the key points of the article. Try to visualize the artwork from memory and the points each image taught.

  Why not review the artwork in this magazine and see if you can recall what it teaches?
