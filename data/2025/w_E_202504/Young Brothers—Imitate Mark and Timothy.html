<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>YOUNG brothers, do you want to do more in Jehovah’s service and be more helpful to those in your congregation? No doubt you do. How heartwarming it is to see so many young men who are willing to serve others! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) You may, however, face challenges. Do you hesitate to expand your ministry because of fear of the unknown? Have you ever held back from accepting an assignment because you lacked confidence? If so, you are not the first to feel this way.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Mark and Timothy faced similar challenges. But they did not allow fear of the unknown or their lack of experience to stop them from serving others. Possibly, Mark was living with his mother in a comfortable home when he was invited to travel with the apostle Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary tour. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:12-44:12:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 12:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:25-44:12:25" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 25</a>) Mark left that familiar environment to expand his ministry. First, he moved to Antioch. Then, he accompanied Paul and Barnabas to other faraway places. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:1-44:13:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 13:1-5</a>) Similarly, Timothy was likely living with his parents when he was invited by Paul to join him in the preaching work. Being young and inexperienced, Timothy could have allowed a lack of confidence to hold him back. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:16:10-46:16:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:10, 11 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:12-54:4:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:12</a>.) However, he <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>accepted Paul’s invitation and enjoyed many blessings as a result.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:3-44:16:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 16:3-5</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:37-44:15:38" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 15:37, 38</a>) But that did not discourage Mark from serving his brothers and sisters.</p>

After spending some time with Paul in Rome, Mark joined the apostle Peter in Babylon. They developed such a close relationship that Peter called him “Mark, my son.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:13-60:5:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:13</a>) As they worked together, Peter likely related to his young friend many interesting details <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>about Jesus’ life and ministry that Mark later recorded in his Gospel account.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span id="footnotesource1" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

How can you imitate Mark? If you have ever missed out on a privilege of service, be patient with yourself and keep looking for other ways to serve Jehovah and the congregation. Take as an example Seung-Woo, who now serves as an elder. When he was younger, he would compare himself with other young brothers. Some of them received privileges before he did. Seung-Woo felt overlooked and eventually opened up about this to mature brothers. One elder suggested that he do what he could to serve others even if his good deeds sometimes went unnoticed. That advice moved Seung-Woo to make himself available to assist the elderly and those who needed transportation to the meetings. Looking back, he says: “I came to understand what it means to serve others more fully. I discovered the joy that comes from giving practical help to others.”</p>

When he was a young adult, Woo Jae found it difficult to engage older brothers and sisters in conversation. So he simply greeted them at the Kingdom Hall and walked away. An elder suggested that Woo Jae start conversations by telling his fellow believers what he appreciated about them. The elder also urged him to think about what the other person might be interested in. Woo Jae applied this advice in his interactions with others. An elder today, Woo Jae says: “I now find it easier to have meaningful conversations with people of different ages. I feel good knowing that I have a better understanding of other people’s concerns. This has been very useful to me in helping my fellow believers.”</p>

Could you help such ones with their electronic devices or arrange to work with them in the preaching work? By taking the initiative to help others, you will set a fine example for all.</p>

You may also realize that certain activities, though not wrong in themselves, may leave you little time for spiritual pursuits. For example, think of how much time you spend participating in sports, browsing the Internet, or playing video games. Could you use some of that time for theocratic activities? Perhaps you can offer to help maintain the local Kingdom Hall or to support the local cart witnessing program. If you participate in such activities, you will likely make new friends who will help you to set and reach spiritual goals.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) To serve his fellow believers, Mark traveled to different parts of the world. He also wrote a dynamic account of Jesus’ life and ministry. Timothy helped Paul to establish congregations and to build up the brothers and sisters. Obviously, Jehovah was pleased with the self-sacrificing spirit shown by Mark and Timothy.</p>

These inspired letters also reveal that Jehovah loves you young men very much. He wants you to succeed. So take to heart Paul’s fatherly advice, and develop your desire to serve others more fully. If you do, you will enjoy an enriching life now and you will “get a firm hold on the real life” to come.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:18-54:6:19" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:18, 19</a>.</p>
