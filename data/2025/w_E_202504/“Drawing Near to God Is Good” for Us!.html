It seems that at his lowest point, he recognized a need to draw closer to God, as indicated by his words: “But now I am continually with you [Jehovah]; you have taken hold of my right hand. You guide me with your advice, and afterward you will lead me to glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:23-19:73:24" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 73:23, 24</a>) We too should look to Jehovah as a stabilizing rock when we feel weak or discouraged.
