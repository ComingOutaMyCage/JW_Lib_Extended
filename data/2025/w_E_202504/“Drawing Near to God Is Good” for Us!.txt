“Drawing Near to God Is Good” for Us!


“As for me, drawing near to God is good for me.”​—PS. 73:28.


FOCUS
How we can draw closer to Jehovah and the benefits that come from doing so.


1-2. (a) What effort is required to cultivate a close friendship with someone? (b) What will we discuss in this article?

Your answers


DO YOU have a close friend? How did you cultivate your friendship with him? You probably spent time with him, learned about his challenges, and got acquainted with his likes and dislikes. You discovered that he has outstanding qualities that you would like to imitate. You came to love your friend.
2 Developing a close friendship with someone requires time and effort. The same can be said of cultivating a close, personal relationship with Jehovah God. This article will discuss how we can draw closer to our God and the benefits that come from doing so. First, consider why it is good to draw close to our best Friend, Jehovah.
 3. Why should we meditate on the benefits that come from drawing close to Jehovah? Illustrate.

Your answer


3 No doubt you agree that drawing close to Jehovah is good. But meditating on exactly how good it is can motivate us to continue drawing closer to him. (Ps. 63:6-8) For example, we know that following a balanced diet, engaging in physical activity, getting sufficient rest, and drinking enough water are all good for us. Still, many do not give much thought to these things, and they neglect their health. Yet, the more often we think about how healthy habits benefit us, the more likely we will be to maintain them. Similarly, we may know that drawing near to Jehovah is good for us, but meditating on the benefits of doing so can motivate us to continue drawing closer to our Friend.​—Ps. 119:27-30.
 4. As indicated at Psalm 73:28, what feelings did the psalmist express?

Your answer


4 Read Psalm 73:28. The writer of Psalm 73 was a Levite appointed to serve as a musician at Jehovah’s temple. He had likely worshipped Jehovah faithfully for some time. Yet, he still felt a need to remind himself and others that “drawing near to God” was good for him and them. What are some of the benefits of doing so?
“DRAWING NEAR TO GOD” BRINGS HAPPINESS
 5. (a) Why does drawing closer to Jehovah bring us happiness? (b) Based on Proverbs 2:6-16, give specific examples of how Jehovah’s wisdom can benefit and protect you personally.

Your answers


5 The closer we draw to Jehovah, the happier we will be. (Ps. 65:4) This is true for many reasons. For one thing, we benefit from applying the practical wisdom found in his Word, the Bible. Such wisdom protects us from bad influences and from making serious mistakes. (Read Proverbs 2:6-16.) Appropriately, the Bible states: “Happy is the man who finds wisdom and the man who acquires discernment.”​—Prov. 3:13.
 6. What caused the psalmist to lose his joy?

Your answer


6 Of course, even Jehovah’s friends go through periods of sadness. The writer of Psalm 73 lost his joy when he gave in to negative thinking. He became annoyed and envious because, in his mind, bad people who did not care about God or His standards had it easy. He wrongly assumed that violent and haughty people were always richer and healthier and were even immune from suffering. (Ps. 73:3-7, 12) The psalmist was so troubled that at one point he wondered if his efforts to serve Jehovah were worth it. In his sadness he exclaimed: “Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence.”​—Ps. 73:13.
 7. How can we recover from bouts of sadness that can threaten our happiness? (See also picture.)

Your answer


7 The psalmist did not allow sadness to paralyze him. He took action. He “entered the grand sanctuary of God,” where Jehovah corrected his thinking. (Ps. 73:17-19) When we are sad, Jehovah, our best Friend, knows about it. If we pray to him for guidance and accept the help he provides through his Word and the congregation, we will receive the inner strength to endure sadness. Even when we feel overwhelmed with anxieties, Jehovah will comfort and soothe us.​—Ps. 94:19.a




The Levite who wrote Psalm 73 stands in “the grand sanctuary of God” (See paragraph 7)




“DRAWING NEAR TO GOD” GIVES US PURPOSE AND HOPE
 8. In what other important ways is drawing near to God good for us?

Your answer


8 Drawing near to God is good for us in two other important ways. First, it gives us a fulfilling purpose in life. Second, it gives us a solid hope for the future. (Jer. 29:11) Let us examine these benefits more closely.
 9. How does drawing close to Jehovah give meaning to our life?

Your answer


9 Drawing close to Jehovah gives our life purpose. Many today who deny God’s existence think that life has no meaning and that eventually the human race will cease to exist. However, from our study of God’s Word, we have become convinced that God “is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” (Heb. 11:6) Even today, we live happier lives because we are doing what we were designed to do​—serve our heavenly Father, Jehovah.​—Deut. 10:12, 13.
10. What is revealed at Psalm 37:29 regarding the future of those who hope in Jehovah?

Your answer


10 For many, their hope is limited to this life​—going to work, raising a family, and saving for retirement. God is not in the picture. On the other hand, Jehovah’s servants place their hope on him. (Ps. 25:3-5; 1 Tim. 6:17) We trust the God to whom we have drawn near, and we trust what he has promised us. Our future includes the prospect of worshipping him forever in Paradise.​—Read Psalm 37:29.
11. How does drawing near to God affect us, and how does it affect him?

Your answer


11 Drawing near to God is good for us in many other ways. For instance, Jehovah promises to forgive the sins of repentant ones who are close to him. (Isa. 1:18) As a result, we do not have to carry the weight of a guilty conscience because of past sins. (Ps. 32:1-5) And we have the pleasure of making Jehovah happy. (Prov. 23:15) Surely you can think of other blessings that result from a close friendship with God. How, though, can you keep drawing near to God?
HOW TO KEEP “DRAWING NEAR TO GOD”
12. What have you done to draw closer to God?

Your answer


12 If you are a baptized Christian, you have to a great extent already drawn close to Jehovah. You have learned many truths about Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, repented of your past sins, exercised strong faith in God, and endeavored to act in harmony with his will. To draw closer to God, however, we must continue doing these things.​—Col. 2:6.
13. What three things can help us to continue drawing closer to Jehovah?

Your answer


13 What will help us to keep drawing closer to Jehovah? (1) We must continue reading and studying the Bible. As we do so, our goal should be more than merely learning basic facts about God. Rather, we should try to perceive what God’s will is for us and to be governed by the principles that he has set out in his Word. (Eph. 5:15-17) (2) We must strengthen our faith by meditating on the abundant evidence of his love for us. (3) We must continue to hate the things that offend Jehovah and to avoid friendship with people who practice such things.​—Ps. 1:1; 101:3.
14. In harmony with what is stated at 1 Corinthians 10:31, what are some of the things we can do in our daily lives to please Jehovah? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


14 Read 1 Corinthians 10:31. It is vital that we actively pursue the things that please Jehovah. This goes beyond what we do in the ministry and at congregation meetings. Good actions that please Jehovah include what we do in our daily life. For instance, when we are honest in all things and share what we have with others, we make Jehovah happy. (2 Cor. 8:21; 9:7) He also wants us to show high regard for the gift of life. We draw closer to the Giver of life by maintaining balanced habits in eating and drinking and by caring for our health in other reasonable ways. Every effort we make to please Jehovah, even in seemingly small things, will endear us to him.​—Luke 16:10.




Driving safely, caring for ourselves by exercising and eating healthy food, and being hospitable are some ways we can please Jehovah (See paragraph 14)




15. How does Jehovah expect us to treat others?

Your answer


15 Jehovah is kind to both the righteous and the unrighteous. (Matt. 5:45) He expects us to show similar consideration for others. For example, we are “to speak injuriously of no one, not to be quarrelsome, . . . displaying all mildness toward all men.” (Titus 3:2) With this in mind, we do not look down on others simply because they do not share our beliefs. (2 Tim. 2:23-25) We draw closer to Jehovah by always being kind and considerate in our dealings with all.
WE CAN DRAW “NEAR TO GOD” EVEN WHEN WE STUMBLE
16. How did the writer of Psalm 73 begin to feel after some time?

Your answer


16 But what if after some time, you begin to feel that you are unworthy of Jehovah’s love? As discussed, something similar happened to the writer of Psalm 73. He lamented: “My feet had almost strayed; my steps had nearly slipped.” (Ps. 73:2) By his own admission, he had become “sour” and “unreasoning” “like a senseless beast” before Jehovah. (Ps. 73:21, 22) Did he conclude that because of his error, he was a lost cause, unworthy of Jehovah’s love?
17. (a) Even at his lowest point, what did the psalmist seem to do? (b) What lesson can we learn from his experience? (See also pictures.)

Your answers


17 If the psalmist felt rejected by Jehovah, the feeling must have been only momentary. It seems that at his lowest point, he recognized a need to draw closer to God, as indicated by his words: “But now I am continually with you [Jehovah]; you have taken hold of my right hand. You guide me with your advice, and afterward you will lead me to glory.” (Ps. 73:23, 24) We too should look to Jehovah as a stabilizing rock when we feel weak or discouraged. (Ps. 73:26; 94:18) Even if our feet do stray temporarily, we can return to Jehovah with the assurance that he is “ready to forgive.” (Ps. 86:5) Especially when we are at our lowest point, we should draw closer to our God.​—Ps. 103:13, 14.




When we feel spiritually weak, we should draw closer to Jehovah by getting more involved in our worship of him (See paragraph 17)




“DRAWING NEAR TO GOD” FOREVER
18. Why is there no limit to drawing closer to Jehovah?

Your answer


18 There is no limit to how closely we can draw to Jehovah and how well we can get to know him. The Bible says that Jehovah’s ways, his wisdom, and his knowledge are “beyond tracing out.”​—Rom. 11:33.
19. What assurance do the Psalms give us?

Your answer


19 Psalm 79:13 states: “We, your people and the flock of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; and we will declare your praise from generation to generation.” As you keep drawing near to God, you too can feel assured of receiving eternal blessings and confidently say: “God is the rock of my heart and my portion forever.”​—Ps. 73:26.
