Some years ago, they decided to move to where there was a greater need for Kingdom publishers. “We trusted that Jehovah would bless our efforts,” Nathan says. However, after arriving in their new assignment, they faced unexpected health problems and financial hardships. The couple eventually had to return home, where they still continued to struggle financially. “I wondered why God hadn’t blessed us the way we thought he would,” Nathan recalls. “I even began to wonder if I had done something wrong.” In time, however, Nathan and Priscilla came to realize that God had not abandoned them in their time of need. “During those difficult times, the Bible became like a wise friend offering us encouragement and guidance,” Nathan relates. “Focusing on how Jehovah helped us to endure that hardship instead of focusing on the trial itself prepared us to face future challenges with faith.”</p>

Consider the example of Helga, who lives in Hungary. For decades, she dealt <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>with a variety of challenges that left her feeling desperate and worthless. But looking back, she can see how Jehovah comforted her through the congregation. She writes: “Jehovah has always helped me when he saw that my strength was meager because of secular work, caring for my sick child, and other trials. There has not been a day during the last 30 years that he has not kept his promise to comfort me. He often strengthens me through kind, thoughtful, and appreciative comments from others. I have often received a message, a card, or a word of commendation right when I needed it most.”</p>

How can we do so? We can listen to them patiently, speak with them consolingly, and help them in practical ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:27-20:3:27" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Prov. 3:27</a>) We endeavor to comfort all who suffer, including those not yet serving God. When our neighbors experience grief, illness, or anxiety, we visit them, listen to them, and share with them encouraging passages from the Bible. When we imitate Jehovah, “the God of all comfort,” we may not only help fellow believers to endure trials but also soften the hearts of unbelievers toward pure worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 5:16</a>.</p>
