The apostle Paul wrote: “For yet ‘a very little while,’ and ‘the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:37-58:10:37" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb. 10:37</a>) How does this affect us? For one thing, the time left for people to choose to serve <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>Jehovah is reduced. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:29-46:7:29" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:29</a>) And if we have already made the choice to serve God, we know that although we will have to endure trials, it will be only for “a very little while.”</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 16:24</a>) So if we have been serving Jehovah for years, may we be resolved not to give up. We have to work hard to keep living up to our decision to serve him.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[72]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Some feel that serving Jehovah involves too much sacrifice. If you are young, do you feel that you may be losing out on something if you serve Jehovah? One young brother named Gene says: “I felt that being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses was restrictive. It seemed that many of the kids I grew up with enjoyed things like partying, dating, or playing violent video games, while I had to spend my time at meetings and in the ministry.” How did this thinking affect Gene? “I started living a double life,” he says, “and for a while I had fun. But it didn’t bring me any lasting happiness. I began to think about the Bible truths I had chosen to ignore and decided to serve Jehovah wholeheartedly. Ever since then, it seems that Jehovah has responded to every one of my prayers.”</p>
