The Best Way to Respond to Injustice


“He kept hoping for justice, but look! there was injustice.”​—ISA. 5:7.


FOCUS
How Jesus’ example helps us respond to injustice in a way that pleases Jehovah.


1-2. How do many people react to injustice, and what might we wonder about?

Your answer


WE LIVE in an unjust world. People are treated unfairly for many reasons, such as their economic status, gender, ethnicity, or race. They suffer the effects of environmental problems caused or worsened by greedy executives and corrupt officials. These and other injustices affect us all, either directly or indirectly.
2 It is not surprising that many are angry about the injustice they see in the world today. We all want to live in a world where we feel safe and are treated fairly. Some get involved in social reform efforts. They sign petitions, join protests, and support political leaders who promise to fight injustice. However, as Christians, we are taught to be “no part of the world” and to wait on God’s Kingdom to eliminate all injustice. (John 17:16) Still, we cannot help but be dismayed​—even angry—​when we see someone being treated unfairly. We may wonder: ‘How should I respond? Is there anything I can do about injustice right now?’ To answer these questions, let us begin by considering how Jehovah and Jesus feel about injustice.
JEHOVAH AND JESUS HATE INJUSTICE
 3. Why is it understandable for us to feel angry about injustice? (Isaiah 5:7)

Your answer


3 The Bible gives us the reason why it is understandable for us to be disturbed by injustice. It explains that Jehovah created us in his image and that he “loves righteousness and justice.” (Ps. 33:5; Gen. 1:26) He never acts unjustly, and he does not want anyone else to act that way! (Deut. 32:3, 4; Mic. 6:8; Zech. 7:9) For example, during the time of the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah heard “a cry of distress” from many Israelites who were being mistreated by their countrymen. (Read Isaiah 5:7.) Jehovah took action by punishing those who repeatedly ignored his Law and treated others unfairly.​—Isa. 5:5, 13.
 4. What does an event found in the Gospels reveal about how Jesus views injustice? (See also picture.)

Your answer


4 Like Jehovah, Jesus loves justice and hates injustice. On one occasion during his earthly ministry, he saw a man with a disability​—a withered hand. Jesus was moved to help him, but the coldhearted religious leaders felt very differently. They were more concerned with enforcing their rigid interpretation of the Sabbath law than with helping the disadvantaged man. How did Jesus feel about their reaction? He was “thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts.”​—Mark 3:1-6.




Jewish religious leaders did not have empathy for those in need, but Jesus did (See paragraph 4)




 5. What must we remember about the anger we may feel regarding an injustice?

Your answer


5 Given that both Jehovah and Jesus are angered by injustice, it is not wrong for us to feel that way too. (Eph. 4:26 and study note “Be wrathful”) Yet, we must remember that any anger we feel​—even if it is justified—​will not fix injustice. In fact, prolonged or uncontrolled anger may harm us emotionally and physically. (Ps. 37:1, 8; Jas. 1:20) So how should we deal with injustice? We can learn from Jesus’ example.
HOW JESUS DEALT WITH INJUSTICE
 6. What injustices were common when Jesus was on earth? (See also picture.)

Your answer


6 Jesus saw great injustice when he was on earth. He witnessed how the common people were oppressed by the religious leaders. (Matt. 23:2-4) He was aware of how harshly the Roman authorities treated the people. Many Jews longed for independence from Rome. Some, such as the Zealots, were willing to fight for it. Yet, Jesus did not initiate or support movements for social change. When he learned that people were planning to make him king, Jesus separated himself from them.​—John 6:15.




Jesus separated himself from the people when they wanted to involve him in political issues of the time (See paragraph 6)




7-8. Why did Jesus not try to eliminate injustice when he was on earth? (John 18:36)

Your answer


7 When he was on earth, Jesus did not try to work with the political systems of the day in order to eliminate injustice. Why not? He knew that humans have neither the right nor the ability to govern themselves. (Ps. 146:3; Jer. 10:23) They are also incapable of addressing the root causes of injustice. The world is ruled by Satan the Devil, a murderous spirit creature who uses his authority to incite injustice. (John 8:44; Eph. 2:2) And imperfection makes it impossible for even the most well-meaning humans to act fairly at all times.​—Eccl. 7:20.
8 Jesus knew that only God’s Kingdom will fully address the root causes of injustice. For that reason, he spent his time and energy on “preaching and declaring the good news of the Kingdom of God.” (Luke 8:1) He assured “those hungering and thirsting for righteousness” that the end of corruption and injustice would come. (Matt. 5:6 and study note; Luke 18:7, 8) However, this will be achieved, not through social reform, but through the rulership of God’s heavenly government, which is “no part of this world.”​—Read John 18:36.
IMITATE JESUS WHEN DEALING WITH INJUSTICE
 9. What convinces you that only God’s Kingdom will eliminate all injustice?

Your answer


9 Today we see even more injustice than Jesus saw when he was on earth. But the source of injustice in these “last days” continues to be Satan and the imperfect people under his influence. (2 Tim. 3:1-5, 13; Rev. 12:12) Like Jesus, we know that only God’s Kingdom will eliminate the root causes of injustice. Because we fully support that Kingdom, we refuse to get involved with this world’s marches, protests, and other efforts to curb injustice. Consider the experience of a sister named Stacy.a Before she learned the truth, Stacy regularly joined in efforts to promote social reform. But she began to have doubts about what she was doing. She says: “When I was at protests, I would question whether I was on the correct side. Now that I support God’s Kingdom, I know that I’m on the right side. I know that Jehovah will fight for every victim of oppression better than I ever could.”​—Ps. 72:1, 4.
10. In what way are social reform movements out of harmony with Jesus’ counsel found at Matthew 5:43-48? (See also picture.)

Your answer


10 The social reform movements of this world are often marked by an independent and bitter spirit that is at odds with Jesus’ example and teachings. (Eph. 4:31) A brother named Jeffrey observes: “I know that seemingly peaceful protests can in a matter of seconds turn into violence and looting.” However, Jesus teaches us to treat all people with love, even those who disagree with us or persecute us. (Read Matthew 5:43-48.) As Christians, we do our best to avoid anything that is out of harmony with the pattern that Jesus set for us.




It takes determination to remain neutral with regard to the political and social issues of our time (See paragraph 10)




11. What can test our determination not to support social reform movements?

Your answer


11 Although we know that God’s Kingdom will permanently solve injustice, we could find it hard to imitate Jesus when we are treated unfairly. Consider what happened to Janiya, who experienced discrimination. She admits: “I was furious. I also felt hurt and wanted the injustice to be avenged. Then I thought about supporting a movement protesting racism and discrimination. I felt that doing so was a safe way to express my anger.” In time, however, Janiya realized that she needed to make changes. “I was allowing others to sway my thinking,” she says, “to influence me to place my trust in man instead of in Jehovah. I decided to cut off all association with the movement.” We must be careful not to allow any righteous anger we feel to cause us to compromise our neutral stand regarding this world’s political and social issues.​—John 15:19.
12. Why is it wise to be selective regarding the information we take in?

Your answer


12 What can help us to control our feelings of anger over an injustice? Many have found it helpful to be selective in what they read, listen to, and watch. Some forms of social media are full of posts that sensationalize injustices and that promote social reform movements. Often, news agencies report information in a biased way. Even if we hear a report about a valid injustice, will dwelling on it really help us? If we spend a lot of time consuming such information, we may become needlessly frustrated or discouraged. (Prov. 24:10) Even worse, we could lose sight of the ultimate solution to all injustice​—God’s Kingdom.
13. How can a good routine of Bible reading help us to maintain the right attitude about injustice?

Your answer


13 A good routine of Bible reading and meditation can help us to deal with injustice. A sister named Alia was deeply disturbed by the way people in her community were being mistreated. It seemed that those responsible for the mistreatment were not being held accountable. She says: “I had to sit down and ask myself, ‘Do I actually believe that Jehovah will fix these problems?’ It was during that time that I read Job 34:22-29. Those verses reminded me that no one can hide from Jehovah. Only he has a perfect sense of justice, and only he will fully correct matters.” Still, as we wait for God’s Kingdom to bring true justice, we need to deal with injustice now. How?
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT INJUSTICE NOW
14. What can we do to avoid contributing to this world’s injustices? (Colossians 3:10, 11)

Your answer


14 We may not be able to control the unjust actions of others, but we can control our own actions. As previously discussed, we imitate Jesus by showing love. Such love can move us to treat others​—even perpetrators of injustice—​with respect. (Matt. 7:12; Rom. 12:17) Jehovah is pleased when we treat everyone kindly and fairly.​—Read Colossians 3:10, 11.
15. What effect does our sharing Bible truth have on present injustice?

Your answer


15 The most important way we can respond to injustice is by sharing Bible truths with others. Why do we say that? Because “the knowledge of Jehovah” can transform a person who was formerly aggressive and violent into a kind, peace-loving individual. (Isa. 11:6, 7, 9) Before learning the truth, a man named Jemal joined a rebel group to fight a political regime that he felt was oppressive. He says: “You can’t change people by force. I was not changed by force, but I was changed by Bible truth that I was learning.” What Jemal learned motivated him to stop fighting. The more people there are who are transformed by Bible truth, the fewer people there will be who add to present injustice.
16. Why are you motivated to share the Kingdom hope?

Your answer


16 Like Jesus, we are eager to tell people that God’s Kingdom offers the only permanent solution to injustice. That hope can encourage those who have been mistreated. (Jer. 29:11) Stacy, quoted earlier, explains: “Learning the truth has helped me to cope with the injustices that I have seen and experienced. Jehovah uses the Bible’s message to provide comfort.” To share the Bible’s comforting message about the solution to injustice, you need to be well-prepared. The more convinced you become of the truthfulness of the Scriptural thoughts considered in this article, the better equipped you will be to discuss this topic with tact if it comes up at school or at work.b
17. How does Jehovah help us to cope with present injustice?

Your answer


17 We know that we will face injustice as long as Satan remains “the ruler of this world.” But we are neither helpless nor hopeless as we await his being “cast out.” (John 12:31) Through the Scriptures, Jehovah reveals not only why there is so much injustice but also how he feels about the distress that it causes us. (Ps. 34:17-19) By means of his Son, Jehovah teaches us how we should respond to present injustice and how his Kingdom will soon eliminate injustice once and for all. (2 Pet. 3:13) May we continue to preach the good news of that Kingdom with zeal, eagerly looking forward to the time when the earth will be filled with “justice and righteousness.”​—Isa. 9:7.
