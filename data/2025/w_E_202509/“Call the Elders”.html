<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> The disciple James introduces the subject of God’s arrangement for spiritual assistance by asking: “Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the elders of the congregation.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>James 5:14-16,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:19-59:5:20" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>19, 20</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The context shows that James is speaking of spiritual sickness. For instance, the sick one is told to call, not a doctor, but the elders. And spiritual sickness is implied because the healing can involve the forgiveness of sins. In some respects, the steps needed to treat spiritual sickness are similar to those needed for physical ailments. When we are physically sick, we visit a doctor, explain our symptoms, and follow his directions. Likewise, when we are spiritually ailing, we should approach an elder, describe our situation, and act on the Scriptural counsel we receive.</p>

How wise it is, though, for us to receive help <strong><em>before</em></strong> we cause serious damage to our friendship with God! We must be honest with ourselves. The Scriptures warn that we can deceive ourselves about our spiritual condition. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:22-59:1:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jas. 1:22</a>) Some early Christians in Sardis made this mistake, and Jesus warned them about their spiritual state. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:1-66:3:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 3:1, 2</a>) One way we can check our spiritual health is by comparing our enthusiasm for our worship now with how we felt in previous times. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:4-66:2:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 2:4, 5</a>) We could ask ourselves: ‘Has <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>my joy for Bible reading and meditation diminished? Has my meeting preparation and attendance become haphazard? Has my zeal for the ministry cooled?

If we are unable to remedy the weakness on our own or if it has already led us to violate God’s standards, we should ask the elders for help.</p>

You can choose to speak to an elder who will listen to your concerns, offer practical counsel, and assure you that you can please Jehovah by refusing to act on wrong desires.

Of course, if you are still unable to solve your problem, you could ask an elder for assistance.

Just as a skillful doctor endeavors to set a broken bone with as little pain as possible, the elders focus on healing our spiritual illness without adding to our pain. They are also instructed to “keep an eye on [themselves].” As they help us to straighten our path, elders recognize that they too are imperfect and prone to false steps.

They have been trained to keep our confidential matters private, to base their counsel on the Bible rather than on their own opinions, and to follow through in helping us carry our burdens. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:13-20:11:13" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Prov. 11:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:2-48:6:2" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:2</a>) Their personalities and experience vary, but we can feel free to approach any elder to discuss a problem. Of course, we would not go from one elder to another, asking for advice, hoping to find one who will tell <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>us what we want to hear. If we were to do that, we would be like those who would rather have “their ears tickled” than learn the “wholesome teaching” of God’s Word. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:3-55:4:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:3</a>) When we approach an elder about a problem, he may ask us if we have talked with other elders about it and what counsel they gave. And modesty may move him to ask another elder for advice.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:10-20:13:10" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Prov. 13:10</a>.</p>

We have a personal responsibility to live a life of godly devotion. We must answer to God for our own words and actions. With his support, we can meet the challenge of keeping our integrity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Rom. 14:12</a>) So rather than dictate a course of action to us, the elders direct attention to God’s thinking as found in his Word. By following their Bible-based counsel, we can train our own “powers of discernment” to make wise decisions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:11-43:10:11" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 10:11</a>) And by means of the elders in the Christian congregation, Jehovah has fulfilled his promise: “I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they will feed you with knowledge and insight.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:3:15-24:3:15" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Jer. 3:15</a>) When we are spiritually weak or sick, we should not hesitate to call the elders for their help.
