For instance, one Thursday a young woman in Canada approached a literature cart and picked up a copy of the <em>Enjoy Life Forever!</em> brochure. The sister at the cart explained that the brochure came with a free Bible study. The young woman was interested and shared her contact information. Later that day, the young woman texted the sister about the study. When the sister offered to come on the weekend, the young woman asked: “How about tomorrow? I’m free.” They had the study that Friday. The young woman attended her first meeting that very weekend and continued to make rapid progress.</p>

They noted that what works better is using such expressions as “conversation,” “discussion,” and “get to know the Bible.” You could introduce the idea of continuing the conversation by saying, “It’s surprising how life’s important questions are answered in the Bible” or “The Bible is not just a religious book; it helps us in practical ways.” You could add: “It doesn’t take a lot of time; 10 to 15 minutes is enough to learn something valuable.” That could be said without using the terms “appointment” or “every week,” which could imply a commitment.</p>
