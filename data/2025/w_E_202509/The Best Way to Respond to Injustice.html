However, as Christians, we are taught to be “no part of the world” and to wait on God’s Kingdom to eliminate all injustice.

He says: “You can’t change people by force. I was not changed by force, but <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>I was changed by Bible truth that I was learning.” What Jemal learned motivated him to stop fighting. The more people there are who are transformed by Bible truth, the fewer people there will be who add to present injustice.</p>

That hope can encourage those who have been mistreated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:29:11-24:29:11" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jer. 29:11</a>) Stacy, quoted earlier, explains: “Learning the truth has helped me to cope with the injustices that I have seen and experienced. Jehovah uses the Bible’s message to provide comfort.” To share the Bible’s comforting message about the solution to injustice, you need to be well-prepared. The more convinced you become of the truthfulness of the Scriptural thoughts considered in this article, the better equipped you will be to discuss this topic with tact if it comes up at school or at work.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span id="footnotesource2" class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:17-19:34:19" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 34:17-19</a>) By means of his Son, Jehovah teaches us how we should respond to present injustice and how his Kingdom will soon eliminate injustice once and for all.
