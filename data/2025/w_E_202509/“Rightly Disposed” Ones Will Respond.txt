SONG 54 “This Is the Way”

“Rightly Disposed” Ones Will Respond


“All those who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers.”​—ACTS 13:48.


FOCUS
When to offer Bible studies and invite people to our meetings.


 1. How do people differ in the way they respond to the good news? (Acts 13:47, 48; 16:14, 15)

Your answer


MANY people in the first century accepted the truth as soon as they heard the Christian message. (Read Acts 13:47, 48; 16:14, 15.) Likewise today, some rejoice when they hear the good news for the first time. Even those who initially show no interest in the Kingdom message may later open their heart wide to accept it. What should we do when we find “rightly disposed” people in our ministry?
 2. In what way is our disciple-making work like that of a gardener?

Your answer


2 Consider an illustration. Our disciple-making work can be compared to that of a gardener. If the fruit of one plant is ripe, the gardener probably harvests it even though he might still be tilling the soil or planting somewhere else in his garden. Similarly, when we find someone who is ready to accept our message, we want to help him to become a disciple of Christ as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we continue to cultivate the interest of others who need more time to see the value of what they are hearing. (John 4:35, 36) Discernment will help us choose the approach that is best for our listeners. Let us now consider what we can do during our first conversation to help people who are ready to respond. We will also consider how we can help such ones to continue progressing.
WHEN PEOPLE ARE READY TO RESPOND
 3. What approach might we use when we find interested ones in our ministry? (1 Corinthians 9:26)

Your answer


3 When we find interested people in our ministry, we want to help them to get started on the road to life right away. In such cases, we should not hold back from offering a Bible study and inviting them to our meetings during the very first conversation.​—Read 1 Corinthians 9:26.
 4. Relate an experience of someone who was ready for a Bible study immediately.

Your answer


4 Offering a study. Some we speak with are ready for a Bible study immediately. For instance, one Thursday a young woman in Canada approached a literature cart and picked up a copy of the Enjoy Life Forever! brochure. The sister at the cart explained that the brochure came with a free Bible study. The young woman was interested and shared her contact information. Later that day, the young woman texted the sister about the study. When the sister offered to come on the weekend, the young woman asked: “How about tomorrow? I’m free.” They had the study that Friday. The young woman attended her first meeting that very weekend and continued to make rapid progress.
 5. How can we show discernment when offering a Bible study? (See also pictures.)

Your answer


5 Of course, we do not expect all who listen to our message to be as eager as that young woman was. The interest of some may need further cultivation. We may first need to start a conversation on a topic that interests the person. Still, if we maintain a positive attitude and keep showing personal interest in the individual, in a short time, we may be able to start a study. What can we say when offering the study? That question was posed to a number of brothers and sisters who are effective at starting Bible studies.




How might we make a study more appealing to these individuals? (See paragraph 5)a




 6. How might we offer to continue the discussion with an interested person?

Your answer


6 The publishers and the pioneers who were asked about starting studies explained that in some lands it is best to avoid such terms as “study,” “Bible course,” or “teach you” when describing the study. They noted that what works better is using such expressions as “conversation,” “discussion,” and “get to know the Bible.” You could introduce the idea of continuing the conversation by saying, “It’s surprising how life’s important questions are answered in the Bible” or “The Bible is not just a religious book; it helps us in practical ways.” You could add: “It doesn’t take a lot of time; 10 to 15 minutes is enough to learn something valuable.” That could be said without using the terms “appointment” or “every week,” which could imply a commitment.
 7. When have some first recognized Bible truth? (1 Corinthians 14:23-25)

Your answer


7 Invite them to a meeting. It seems that in the apostle Paul’s time, some first recognized Bible truth when they attended a Christian meeting. (Read 1 Corinthians 14:23-25.) The same is often true today. Most new ones progress more quickly once they begin attending our meetings. When should you invite them? The Enjoy Life Forever! book includes an invitation in lesson 10, but you do not need to wait until you have reached that part of the book. From the very first conversation, you could invite your listener to the weekend meeting, perhaps mentioning the title of the public talk or a point from that week’s Watchtower Study.
 8. What aspects of our meetings can we focus on when inviting someone to attend? (Isaiah 54:13)

Your answer


8 When inviting an interested person, explain how our meetings are different from the religious services he may be used to. When a Bible student attended her first Watchtower Study, she asked her teacher, “Does the conductor know everyone’s name?” The sister explained that we all try to know the names of those in our congregation, just as we know the names of our family members. The student found this to be quite different from her experience in church. Similarly, the purpose of our meetings is new for many. (Read Isaiah 54:13.) We meet to worship Jehovah, to learn from him, and to encourage one another. (Heb. 2:12; 10:24, 25) As a result, our meetings are orderly and practical, not ritualistic. (1 Cor. 14:40) The auditorium is well-lit because we come to the Kingdom Hall to learn. And we never promote one political party over another because we are politically neutral; nor do we engage in shouting matches or disputes. It may be helpful beforehand to show the student the video What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? That way he will know what to expect.
9-10. When inviting someone to attend a meeting, what can we do to assure him that we will not pressure him to join or to participate? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 Some hesitate to attend a meeting because they are afraid that they will be asked to “join a church.” Assure the person that we enjoy having visitors and that we do not pressure them to join or to participate. Families are welcome, including those with young children. At our meetings, children do not receive separate instruction. Instead, parents and children sit together and learn together. In this way, parents know whom their children are with and what they are being taught. (Deut. 31:12) We do not take up collections or pass out donation envelopes. Instead, we follow Jesus’ command: “You received free, give free.” (Matt. 10:8) You might also mention to the individual that he does not need expensive clothing to attend. God looks at the heart, not at a person’s appearance.​—1 Sam. 16:7.
10 If the person attends, do what you can to make him feel welcome. Introduce him to the elders and to other publishers. If he feels at home, he will be more likely to want to return. During the meeting, if he does not have a Bible, share yours with him and show him how we follow the reasoning of the speaker or of the study.




The sooner a person attends a meeting, the sooner he or she will benefit (See paragraphs 9-10)




WHEN A BIBLE STUDY IS STARTED
11. How can you show that you respect your listener’s time and schedule?

Your answer


11 What points should we keep in mind about the home Bible study itself? Respect the householder’s time and schedule. For example, if you make an appointment, be on time, regardless of the way people in your area view punctuality. In addition, you may find it best to keep the first session reasonably short. Some experienced publishers suggest finishing early, even if the person wants to hear more. And do not talk too much. Let the householder express himself.​—Prov. 10:19.
12. What should be our goal from the start of a home Bible study?

Your answer


12 From the very start, your goal should be to help your listener to come to know Jehovah and Jesus and to develop love for them. You do this by directing attention to God’s Word instead of to yourself and your Bible knowledge. (Acts 10:25, 26) The apostle Paul often focused his teaching on Jesus Christ, the one whom Jehovah sent to help us to know and love Him. (1 Cor. 2:1, 2) Paul also made it clear how important it is to help new disciples to develop fine qualities, which can be compared to gold, silver, and precious stones. (1 Cor. 3:11-15) Such valuable qualities include faith, wisdom, discernment, and the fear of Jehovah. (Ps. 19:9, 10; Prov. 3:13-15; 1 Pet. 1:7) Imitate Paul’s method of teaching by helping your students to develop a strong faith and a personal relationship with their loving heavenly Father.​—2 Cor. 1:24.
13. How can we show patience and understanding as we help interested ones? (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5) (See also picture.)

Your answer


13 Follow Jesus’ way of teaching by showing patience and understanding. Avoid asking questions that make the person uncomfortable. If necessary, move past points that he struggles with and return to these later. Rather than try to force him to accept a teaching before he is ready, allow time for the truth to take root in his heart. (John 16:12; Col. 2:6, 7) The Bible compares the false teachings we are trying to overcome to a fortress. (Read 2 Corinthians 10:4, 5; see study note on “overturning strongly entrenched things.”) Instead of pulling down your student’s fortress on top of him, help him make Jehovah his Refuge.​—Ps. 91:9.




Allow time for the truth to take root in your student’s heart (See paragraph 13)




WHEN NEW ONES ATTEND MEETINGS
14. How should we treat new ones who attend our meetings?

Your answer


14 Jehovah expects us to be impartial in our treatment of new ones, regardless of their culture, social status, or ethnic background. (Jas. 2:1-4, 9) So how can we show love to those who visit our meetings?
15-16. How can we help new ones to feel welcome at our meetings?

Your answer


15 Some individuals may simply come to our meetings out of curiosity or may have been urged to attend by someone living in another area. So we should not hesitate to approach such ones who come to our meeting place. Welcome them without overwhelming them. Invite them to sit with you. Share your Bible and study materials, or provide them with their own copies. In addition, consider their feelings. One man who visited a Kingdom Hall told the brother who welcomed him that he was nervous about being in casual clothes. The brother made him feel at ease and explained that Jehovah’s Witnesses are just normal people. The man, who eventually progressed to baptism, never forgot the brother’s response. A word of caution, though: When you speak with visitors before or after the meeting, show personal interest without prying into their personal matters.​—1 Pet. 4:15.
16 We can also make our visitors feel welcome by being respectful in our conversations, comments, and meeting parts when referring to non-Witnesses or their beliefs. Avoid expressions that could stumble them or be viewed as an insult. (Titus 2:8; 3:2) For instance, we would never disparage the beliefs of those who do not share our faith. (2 Cor. 6:3) In this regard, brothers giving public talks take special care. They also show that they keep in mind non-Witnesses in the audience by explaining words or concepts that the public would not understand.
17. What is our goal when we find “rightly disposed” ones in our ministry?

Your answer


17 Our disciple-making work becomes more urgent with each passing day, and we continue to find people who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) When we do, we should not hesitate to offer them a Bible study or invite them to our meetings. By doing so, we can help them take their first steps on “the road leading off into life.”​—Matt. 7:14.
