In some languages, the words “respect” and “honor” are related. How? “Respect” refers primarily to how we <strong><em>view</em></strong> a person. When we respect others, we view them as worthy of our attention and consideration, perhaps because of their qualities, their achievements, or their position. “Honor,” though, refers to how we <strong><em>treat</em></strong> a person. When we honor others, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>we treat them in ways that make them feel valued, appreciated, and dignified.

The apostle Peter reminded Christians that their fine conduct might move some to “glorify God.” For that reason, he admonished them to make a defense of their faith “with a mild temper and deep respect.” <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 2:12;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> <strong>3:15</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Whether standing trial for their faith or defending their beliefs while in conversation with a neighbor, <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>Christians were to treat unbelievers just as they would if they were in the presence of God. After all, Jehovah is watching and listening to what we say and how we say it. What a powerful reason to treat those outside the congregation with respect!</p>

We have seen that when we show respect for our family, we honor our family Head, Jehovah. Likewise, when we show respect for our spiritual brothers and sisters, we honor our heavenly Father. And when we show respect for those outside the congregation, we create the best possible circumstances for them to glorify, or honor, our great God. Even if we never receive respect in return from some humans, it will be worthwhile to cultivate and show respect for them. Why? Because Jehovah will bless us. He promises: “Those honoring me I will honor.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:30-9:2:30" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:30</a>.</p>
