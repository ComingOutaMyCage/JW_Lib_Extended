<div class="bodyTxt">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Jesus has always been obedient to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:29-43:8:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:29</a>) Why, then, does the Bible say: “He <strong><em>learned obedience</em></strong> from the things he suffered”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:8-58:5:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 5:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">While on earth, Jesus faced circumstances that did not exist in heaven. He was raised by devoted but imperfect parents. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:51-42:2:51" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 2:51</a>) He suffered at the hands of corrupt religious leaders and unjust secular rulers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:59-40:26:59" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 26:59;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:15:15-41:15:15" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 15:15</a>) Furthermore, “he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death,” an agonizing death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:8-50:2:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 2:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">These experiences taught Jesus obedience in a way that he had never learned in heaven. He thus could become the perfect King and High Priest, one who could sympathize with us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:15-58:4:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:9-58:5:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5:9</a>) Jesus became more valuable to Jehovah after learning obedience from the things he suffered. We too can become more precious to Jehovah and useful for any assignment he might give us when we remain obedient under challenging circumstances.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:4-59:1:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jas. 1:4</a>.</p>
