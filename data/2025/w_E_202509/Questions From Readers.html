<h2 class="du-color--gray-800" id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>The writer of</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:18-20:30:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 30:18, 19</strong></a> <strong>said that “the way of a man with a young woman” was ‘beyond comprehension.’ In what sense is that true?</strong></h2>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3">Many have puzzled over these words, including some scholars. The complete passage in the <em>New World Translation</em> reads: “There are three things that are beyond my comprehension [or, “too wonderful,” ftn.], and four that I do not understand: The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship in the open sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:18-20:30:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 30:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4">Previously, we understood the phrase “the way of a man with a young woman” as having a negative sense. Why? The context mentions negative things that never say “enough.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:15-20:30:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 30:15, 16</a>) And <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:20-20:30:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">verse 20</a> speaks of “an adulterous woman” who claims to have done nothing wrong. Hence, we reasoned that like a soaring eagle, a snake on a rock, or an ancient ship in the open sea, the man may leave no trace of his activity. Based on that reasoning, we understood that the expression “the way of a man with a young woman” referred to something bad​—a cunning young man who might seduce a naive young woman without her realizing what was happening.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5">However, there is good reason to view the passage in a positive light. The writer was simply marveling at the things mentioned.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6">The original Hebrew supports the view that this verse means something positive. According to the <em>Theological Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> the Hebrew word translated “beyond my comprehension” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:18-20:30:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:18</a> “indicates an event that a person . . . finds extraordinary, impossible, even wonderful.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7">Professor Crawford H. Toy of Harvard University in the United States also concluded that this Bible passage does not here describe something negative. He stated: “The point is rather the wonderfulness of the things named.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8">So it seems reasonable to state that the words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:18-20:30:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:18, 19</a> are describing things that are truly wonderful, even beyond our comprehension. Like the Bible writer, we are awed by how an eagle can soar, how a legless serpent can glide over a rock, how a heavy ship can travel across the sea, and how a young man and a young woman can fall in love and have a happy life together.</p>
