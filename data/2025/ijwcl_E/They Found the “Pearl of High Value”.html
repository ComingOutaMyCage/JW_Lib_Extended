<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>Jesus taught that God’s Kingdom will solve all of mankind’s problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:44-40:13:46" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 13:44-46</a>, he gave the following two illustrations to show the value of the truth about God’s Kingdom:</p>

<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>  A man was working in a field and unexpectedly found a hidden treasure.</p>

<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  A traveling merchant seeking fine pearls found one pearl of high value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>Both men gladly sold all that they possessed in order to obtain the treasure they had found. These men represent people who value the Kingdom so much that they make great sacrifices in order to gain its blessings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:29-42:18:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 18:29, 30</a>) In this video, see the story of two people who are like the men in Jesus’ illustrations.</p>
