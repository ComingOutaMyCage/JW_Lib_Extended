TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. Jehovah Had a Right to Expect More


(10 min.)

Jehovah carefully “planted” his “vineyard” with reasonable expectations (Isa 5:1, 2, 7; ip-1 73-74 ¶3-5; 76 ¶8-9)
Jehovah’s vineyard produced only wild grapes (Isa 5:4; w06 6/15 18 ¶1)
Jehovah promised to make the vineyard a wasteland (Isa 5:5, 6; w06 6/15 18 ¶2)







ASK YOURSELF: ‘How does this account motivate me to avoid disappointing Jehovah?’
