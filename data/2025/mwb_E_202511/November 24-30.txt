TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD


1. Hope for Those “Weighed Down With Error”


(10 min.)

[Play the VIDEO Introduction to Isaiah.]
God’s people were “weighed down with error” (Isa 1:4-6; ip-1 14 ¶8)
Jehovah was willing to forgive them completely if they repented (Isa 1:18; ip-1 28-29 ¶15-17)







FOR MEDITATION: How can Jehovah’s invitation to the nation of Israel reassure us if we worry that our sins are too serious to be forgiven?
