7. Do You “Judge With Righteous Judgment”?

(15 min.) Discussion.







Every day we make judgments about people, sometimes subconsciously. Our tendency may be to draw conclusions based on what we see. However, our Exemplar, Jesus, judges differently. (Isa 11:3, 4) Jesus is able to see a person’s heart and to discern his thinking, reasoning, and motives. We do not have this ability. However, we can try our best to imitate Jesus. He said: “Stop judging by the outward appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.”​—Joh 7:24.
Our zeal and effectiveness in the ministry could be hindered if we judge others by what we see. For example, do we hesitate to preach in neighborhoods where people belong to a certain ethnicity or religion? What about neighborhoods that are affluent or that are poor? Do we assume that a person will not be interested based on his appearance? It is God’s will that “all sorts of people should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”​—1Ti 2:4.
