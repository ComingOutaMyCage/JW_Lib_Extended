8. Flee From Sexual Immorality


(15 min.) Discussion.

In the Song of Solomon, the shepherd invited the Shulammite girl on a romantic walk. (Ca 2:10-14) Although his motives were likely innocent, the girl’s wise brothers gave her work to prevent her from accepting his invitation. (Ca 2:15) They understood that being alone in a romantic setting with the one she loved could lead to temptations.
The Bible admonishes Christians to “flee from sexual immorality.” (1Co 6:18) We should avoid any actions that could lead to wrongdoing. The inspired writer of Song of Solomon also wrote: “The shrewd one sees the danger and conceals himself, but the inexperienced keep right on going and suffer the consequences.”​—Pr 22:3.
