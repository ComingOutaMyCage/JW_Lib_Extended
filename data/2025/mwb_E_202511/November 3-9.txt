(15 min.) Discussion by an elder.

When we give generously of our time and resources, blessings result. Of course, the appreciative recipient views our gift as a blessing. However, the generous giver is also blessed. (Pr 22:9) Not only does he experience joy from imitating the Creator but he also gains Jehovah’s approval.​—Pr 19:17; Jas 1:17.
