7. House-to-House Preaching​—Our Trademark


(15 min.) Discussion.

Jehovah’s Witnesses are known for their house-to-house preaching in imitation of Jesus and first-century Christians.​—Lu 10:5; Ac 5:42.
Of course, the house-to-house ministry had to be suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we focused on spreading the good news through informal conversations, letter writing, and telephone witnessing. We are glad to have had the opportunity to become more familiar with these excellent methods of preaching! Still, preaching from house to house remains our primary way of spreading the good news. Are you in a position to participate in the house-to-house work regularly?
