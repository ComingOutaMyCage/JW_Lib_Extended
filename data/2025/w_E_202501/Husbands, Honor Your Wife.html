As a result, they are not happy. A recent report from the World Health Organization indicates that many husbands physically, verbally, or emotionally abuse their wife.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> What can cause some husbands to be abusive? They may have been raised by a violent father, so they think that abusive behavior is normal. Others are influenced by the culture around them, which may promote the wrong idea that “a real man” must use force to show his wife who is the boss. Other men were not taught to control their emotions, including their anger. Some men have developed a warped view of women and sex because of regularly viewing pornography. Additionally, reports indicate that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified these problems. Of course, none of these factors justify a husband’s abusive behavior.</p>

Yet, Paul’s words imply that some in the congregation were still being influenced by the customs and thinking of the world. That is why he exhorted them to change their thinking and behavior. That counsel certainly applies to Christian husbands today.
