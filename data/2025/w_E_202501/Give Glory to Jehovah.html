For example, some go to great lengths on social media to draw attention to themselves and to their accomplishments. However, relatively few today give glory to Jehovah God. In this article, we will discuss what it means to give Jehovah glory and what should motivate us to do so. We will also learn how we can give God the glory he rightly deserves and how he himself will glorify his name in the near future.</p>

In the Bible, the word “glory” can refer to anything that makes someone impressive. Jehovah made an outstanding display of his glory shortly after the nation of Israel was delivered from slavery in Egypt. Picture the scene: Millions of Israelites assemble at the base of Mount Sinai to meet their God. A dark cloud engulfs the mountain. Suddenly, a tremendous earthquake​—apparently coupled with volcanic activity—​shakes the ground beneath their feet while lightning, thunder, and the deafening sound of a horn fill the air.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:12-23:26:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 26:12</a>) King David was an outstanding example of one who gave glory to Jehovah. In a prayer that he offered in the presence of the congregation of Israel, David said to God: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours.” After David concluded his prayer, “all the congregation praised Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:11-13:29:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:20-13:29:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:18-41:5:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 5:18-20</a>) Jesus also brought glory to Jehovah by the way he spoke about his Father and the way he treated others. On one occasion, Jesus was teaching in a synagogue. Among those listening was a woman who had been possessed by a demon for 18 years. The demon had caused her body to be bent double so that she was unable to straighten up. How distressing! Moved by compassion, Jesus approached the woman and addressed her tenderly, saying: “Woman, you are released from your weakness.” He then laid his hands on her, and instantly she stood up straight and “began to glorify God,” her health and dignity fully restored!

She courageously defended Jehovah’s reputation at the company where she works. As a new employee, Angelena was invited to a meeting where those who had recently joined the company were given the opportunity to tell their colleagues something about their background. Angelena prepared a slide show that reflected the joy she has as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. However, just before it was her turn to speak, a fellow worker introduced himself as someone who had been raised as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He began to mock our beliefs. Angelena says: “My heart was pounding. But I thought to myself: ‘Am I going to allow someone to lie about Jehovah? Or am I going to stand up for Him?’”</p>

She then addressed him kindly, saying: “My background is similar to yours. I too was raised as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I continue to be one to this day.” The tension was palpable; yet, Angelena maintained her composure as she shared heartwarming images from spiritual events she had attended and as she tactfully defended her beliefs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) What was the result? By the time Angelena concluded her presentation, the man’s attitude had softened. He even acknowledged that he had fond memories of growing up as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Angelena says: “Jehovah deserves to be defended. It is an honor to speak up for his name.” We too have the honor of praising Jehovah and glorifying him even when others dishonor him.</p>
