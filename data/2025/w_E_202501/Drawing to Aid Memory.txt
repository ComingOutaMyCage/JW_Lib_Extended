Drawing to Aid Memory




Perhaps, like many of us, you find it hard to remember what you study. Yet, have you noticed how Jesus’ illustrations come readily to mind? You can visualize them in your mind’s eye, and that helps you to remember them. Likewise, you can remember more of what you study by creating visual images. How might you do that? By drawing pictures as you learn.
People who draw pictures of new things learned often remember them better. They find that this method works not only with individual words but also with abstract ideas and concepts. Their pictures are not works of art​—just simple, brief sketches. And evidence shows that older people can especially benefit from this technique.
The next time you study, you may want to try drawing some pictures of what you have learned. You might be surprised at how much you remember!
