Satan claims that no servant of God will remain loyal to Him when it is hard to do so. To refute that charge, Jehovah allowed Jesus to suffer before he died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 2:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:21</a>) As Jehovah looked on, Jesus was mocked by religious opposers, whipped raw by soldiers, and nailed to a stake. Then Jehovah watched as his dear Son was left to suffer a painful death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:28-40:27:31" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 27:28-31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:39-40:27:39" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 39</a>) Jehovah had the power to stop the process at any given point. For example, when opposers said: “Let [God] now rescue him if He wants him,” Jehovah could have done just that. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:42-40:27:43" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 27:42, 43</a>) However, if God had stepped in, no ransom would have been paid and we would have been left without hope. So Jehovah permitted his Son to endure suffering until he drew his last breath.</p>

We are made in his image, created with the ability to feel, so it stands to reason that Jehovah has feelings.

The truth is that there is no end to what we can learn about these and other topics. So, what can you do? Take full advantage of the wealth of information that can be found in our publications. When you find a passage that you do not fully understand, do research. Then throughout the day, meditate on what you have discovered and what it tells you about Jehovah, his Son, and their love for you.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 119:97</strong></a> <strong>and footnote.</strong></p>

For example, imitate Jehovah’s justice by treating others impartially. Imitate Jesus’ love for his Father and for others by being willing to suffer for Jehovah’s name and by expending yourself in behalf of your fellow Christians. Also, imitate Jesus by witnessing to others so that they too have the opportunity to accept Jehovah’s priceless gift.</p>
