 1. Many today focus on what?

Your answer


HAVE you noticed that many today seem self-absorbed? For example, some go to great lengths on social media to draw attention to themselves and to their accomplishments. However, relatively few today give glory to Jehovah God. In this article, we will discuss what it means to give Jehovah glory and what should motivate us to do so. We will also learn how we can give God the glory he rightly deserves and how he himself will glorify his name in the near future.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO GIVE JEHOVAH GLORY?
 2. How did Jehovah reveal his glory at Mount Sinai? (See also picture.)

Your answer


2 What is glory? In the Bible, the word “glory” can refer to anything that makes someone impressive. Jehovah made an outstanding display of his glory shortly after the nation of Israel was delivered from slavery in Egypt. Picture the scene: Millions of Israelites assemble at the base of Mount Sinai to meet their God. A dark cloud engulfs the mountain. Suddenly, a tremendous earthquake​—apparently coupled with volcanic activity—​shakes the ground beneath their feet while lightning, thunder, and the deafening sound of a horn fill the air. (Ex. 19:16-18; 24:17; Ps. 68:8) Imagine how impressed those Israelites were when Jehovah revealed this powerful display of his glory.




At Mount Sinai, Jehovah powerfully displayed his glory to the Israelites (See paragraph 2)




 3. What does it mean to give Jehovah glory?

Your answer


3 But what about humans? Can we actually bring glory to Jehovah? Yes, we can. One way we give Jehovah glory is by telling others about his awesome power and his heartwarming qualities. We also glorify God when we give him credit for things we accomplish in his strength. (Isa. 26:12) King David was an outstanding example of one who gave glory to Jehovah. In a prayer that he offered in the presence of the congregation of Israel, David said to God: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on the earth is yours.” After David concluded his prayer, “all the congregation praised Jehovah.”​—1 Chron. 29:11, 20.
 4. How did Jesus give glory to Jehovah?

Your answer


4 When Jesus was on earth, he glorified his Father by acknowledging Him as the Source of his miracles. (Mark 5:18-20) Jesus also brought glory to Jehovah by the way he spoke about his Father and the way he treated others. On one occasion, Jesus was teaching in a synagogue. Among those listening was a woman who had been possessed by a demon for 18 years. The demon had caused her body to be bent double so that she was unable to straighten up. How distressing! Moved by compassion, Jesus approached the woman and addressed her tenderly, saying: “Woman, you are released from your weakness.” He then laid his hands on her, and instantly she stood up straight and “began to glorify God,” her health and dignity fully restored! (Luke 13:10-13) That woman had good reason to give Jehovah glory, and so do we.
WHAT MOTIVATES US TO GIVE JEHOVAH GLORY?
 5. What reasons do we have to respect Jehovah?

Your answer


5 We glorify Jehovah because we deeply respect him. We have many reasons to respect him. Jehovah is almighty; he has limitless power. (Ps. 96:4-7) His profound wisdom is clearly evident in the things he has made. He is the Source of our life and the Sustainer of it. (Rev. 4:11) He is loyal. (Rev. 15:4) Everything he does succeeds, and he always keeps his promises. (Josh. 23:14) No wonder the prophet Jeremiah said regarding Jehovah: “Among all the wise ones of the nations and among all their kingdoms, there is no one at all like you”! (Jer. 10:6, 7) Certainly, we have good reasons to respect our heavenly Father. But Jehovah does more than earn our respect​—he wins our love.
 6. Why do we love Jehovah?

Your answer


6 We glorify Jehovah because we dearly love him. Consider several qualities of Jehovah that make us love him. He is merciful and compassionate. (Ps. 103:13; Isa. 49:15) He is empathetic; when we feel hurt, he feels hurt. (Zech. 2:8) He makes it easy for us to draw close to him as a Friend. (Ps. 25:14; Acts 17:27) And he is humble; “he stoops down to look on heaven and earth, raising the lowly from the dust.” (Ps. 113:6, 7) How could anyone not want to glorify our great God?​—Ps. 86:12.
 7. What special opportunity do we have?

Your answer


7 We glorify Jehovah because we want others to know him. Many do not know the truth about Jehovah. Why? Because Satan has blinded their minds by spreading terrible lies about Him. (2 Cor. 4:4) Satan has convinced people that Jehovah is vengeful, uncaring, and the cause of much of the world’s suffering. But we know the truth about our God! We have the opportunity to set the record straight and thus bring him glory. (Isa. 43:10) Psalm 96 focuses on giving glory to Jehovah. As we discuss some of the inspired words in this psalm, think about ways in which you might give Jehovah the glory he so rightly deserves.
HOW CAN WE GIVE JEHOVAH THE GLORY HE DESERVES?
 8. What is one way we can glorify Jehovah? (Psalm 96:1-3)

Your answer


8 Read Psalm 96:1-3. We can glorify Jehovah by what we say about him. In these verses, Jehovah’s people are invited to “sing to Jehovah,” to “praise his name,” to “proclaim the good news of his salvation,” and to “declare his glory among the nations.” All these are ways in which we can glorify our heavenly Father. Faithful Jews and first-century Christians did not hesitate to tell others about all the good things Jehovah had done for them and to defend his reputation. (Dan. 3:16-18; Acts 4:29) How can we do the same?
9-10. What do you learn from Angelena’s experience? (See also picture.)

Your answer


9 Consider the experience of Angelena,a a sister who lives in the United States. She courageously defended Jehovah’s reputation at the company where she works. As a new employee, Angelena was invited to a meeting where those who had recently joined the company were given the opportunity to tell their colleagues something about their background. Angelena prepared a slide show that reflected the joy she has as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. However, just before it was her turn to speak, a fellow worker introduced himself as someone who had been raised as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He began to mock our beliefs. Angelena says: “My heart was pounding. But I thought to myself: ‘Am I going to allow someone to lie about Jehovah? Or am I going to stand up for Him?’”
10 When her colleague concluded, Angelena said a quick, silent prayer. She then addressed him kindly, saying: “My background is similar to yours. I too was raised as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I continue to be one to this day.” The tension was palpable; yet, Angelena maintained her composure as she shared heartwarming images from spiritual events she had attended and as she tactfully defended her beliefs. (1 Pet. 3:15) What was the result? By the time Angelena concluded her presentation, the man’s attitude had softened. He even acknowledged that he had fond memories of growing up as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Angelena says: “Jehovah deserves to be defended. It is an honor to speak up for his name.” We too have the honor of praising Jehovah and glorifying him even when others dishonor him.




We can glorify Jehovah by means of our speech (See paragraphs 9-10)b




11. How have true worshippers throughout history followed the principle found at Psalm 96:8?

Your answer


11 Read Psalm 96:8. We can glorify Jehovah with our valuable things. True worshippers have always honored Jehovah in that way. (Prov. 3:9) For example, the Israelites contributed toward building and maintaining the temple. (2 Ki. 12:4, 5; 1 Chron. 29:3-9) Caring disciples of Christ ministered to him and his apostles “from their belongings.” (Luke 8:1-3) First-century Christians also contributed relief aid for their spiritual brothers and sisters. (Acts 11:27-29) Today we too can glorify Jehovah by means of our voluntary donations.
12. How can our donations bring glory to Jehovah? (See also picture.)

Your answer


12 Consider just one experience that shows how our donations bring glory to Jehovah. A 2020 report described the effects of a prolonged drought in Zimbabwe. Millions were left on the brink of starvation, including a sister named Prisca. Despite the drought, Prisca continued her routine of preaching each Wednesday and Friday, even during plowing season. Her neighbors ridiculed her for going in the ministry instead of working in her fields, saying, “You are going to starve.” Prisca would confidently reply, “Jehovah has never failed his servants.” Not long after that, she benefited from relief supplies from our organization. Those relief supplies were made available thanks to our donations. Prisca’s neighbors were impressed, and they told her, “God has never failed you, so we want to learn more about him.” Seven of her neighbors began attending congregation meetings.




We can glorify Jehovah by means of our valuable things (See paragraph 12)c




13. How can our conduct bring glory to Jehovah? (Psalm 96:9)

Your answer


13 Read Psalm 96:9. We can glorify Jehovah by our conduct. The priests who served at Jehovah’s temple needed to be physically clean. (Ex. 40:30-32) Yet, even more important than physical cleanliness is clean conduct. (Ps. 24:3, 4; 1 Pet. 1:15, 16) We need to work hard to strip off “the old personality”​—unclean attitudes and practices—​and to clothe ourselves with “the new personality”​—a way of thinking and acting that reflects Jehovah’s glorious qualities. (Col. 3:9, 10) With Jehovah’s help, even the most immoral and violent individuals can change and put on the new personality.
14. What do you learn from Jack’s experience? (See also picture.)

Your answer


14 Consider the experience of Jack, a violent and dangerous man who was nicknamed The Demon. Because of his crimes, Jack was sentenced to death. However, while waiting for the sentence to be carried out, Jack agreed to a Bible study with a brother who visited the prison where Jack was incarcerated. Despite his background, Jack stripped off his old personality and in time qualified for baptism. Jack changed so much that on the day he was to be executed, some of the prison guards had tears in their eyes as they said goodbye. A sergeant who worked at the prison said: “Jack was once the worst inmate in this place. Now he’s one of the best.” The week following Jack’s execution, the brothers who returned to conduct the weekly meeting at the prison met an inmate who was attending the meeting for the first time. What moved him to attend? He was impressed with Jack’s changed conduct and wanted to know what he needed to do to worship Jehovah. Clearly, our conduct can bring glory to our heavenly Father!​—1 Pet. 2:12.




We can glorify Jehovah by means of our conduct (See paragraph 14)d




HOW WILL JEHOVAH GLORIFY HIS NAME IN THE NEAR FUTURE?
15. How will Jehovah completely glorify his name in the near future? (Psalm 96:10-13)

Your answer


15 Read Psalm 96:10-13. These final verses of Psalm 96 describe Jehovah as a righteous Judge and King. How will Jehovah glorify his name in the near future? By means of his judgments. Soon he will execute Babylon the Great for bringing reproach on his holy name. (Rev. 17:5, 16; 19:1, 2) Some who witness the destruction of Babylon the Great might join us in true worship. Finally, at Armageddon, Jehovah will destroy Satan’s entire system, eliminating all those who oppose him and blaspheme his name but saving all those who love and obey him and who are proud to give him glory. (Mark 8:38; 2 Thess. 1:6-10) After the final test that follows Christ’s Thousand Year Reign, Jehovah will have completely sanctified his name. (Rev. 20:7-10) At that time, “the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.”​—Hab. 2:14.
16. What are you determined to do? (See also picture.)

Your answer


16 How thrilling it will be when everyone alive will be giving Jehovah the glory due his name! But until that day arrives, we can do our part by glorifying our God at every opportunity. To emphasize this important issue, the Governing Body has chosen Psalm 96:8 as our yeartext for 2025: “Give Jehovah the glory due his name.”





Eventually, everyone alive will give Jehovah the glory due his name! (See paragraph 16)
