<p><span class="font9">Thales Up to Date</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">tive (vitreous), negative (resinous),and organic (animal); but this knowledge was of slow development up until about 1872. In nothing is the slow growth of man’s knowledge better illustrated than in the discovery, after thousands of years, that lightning and electricity are one and the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Franklin’s experiment with the kite led many experimenters into the electrical field; but not much progress could be made, because a steady current of electricity was unknown. A Leyden jar is either charged or not charged. One discharge, and it is unloaded. Franklin vras one of those most engrossed with the new science. He gave his friends shocks, and even killed a hen. The frictional machine and the Leyden jar (condenser) were the only pieces of electrical apparatus with which the eighteenth century was acquainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About 1725 Stephen Gray astonished himself and his friends by transmitting electricity (or the ‘electric spark’, as he called it) about 880 feet. As late as 1882 Edison was able to pump it only two miles; but the invention by William Stanly of the alternating-current transformer, and the brilliant mind of Charles P. Steinmetz, had given us by 1922 a commercial span of 250 miles, with a pressure behind the current of 220,000 volts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneers of the Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Galvani detected electric current about 1786. Volta, whose death occurred March 5, 1827, developed the first practical electrochemical cell. He is looked up to as the magician who tamed the electric spark. By discovering the principle whereby electricity could be continuously drawn in a current from a cell or battery Volta enriched the ■world with a new source of energy. The volt, named after Volta, has been adopted as the practical unit of electromotive force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1800 Sir Humphry Davy, the Edison of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">rp ha</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">t,n</span><span class="font5">s, of Miletus, a Greek philosopher, who who lived 640-548 B. C., was the first to record the fact that amber, when rubbed, has the power to attract light bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Thales were now to walk down Broadway some night and be told that the millions of electric lights which transform the Great White Way into fairyland are the outcome of his experiments it would surely open his eyes. And if he were to step into a radio shop and hear Judge Rutherford stoutly proclaiming that the kingdom of heaven is here and functioning it would open his ears too, and, we trust, his heart. And he would be interested to know that the radio is but one of the many thousands of applications of electricity to the service of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thales probably never got any farther with his experiments than the rubbing of the amber. The Greek &quot;word for “amber” is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">elektron,</span><span class="font5"> from which is derived our word “electricity”. Later, others discovered that the same phenomena noted by Thales are discernible when a piece of ■wax is rubbed against a coat sleeve, and when a warm glass tube, closed at one end, is rubbed with silk. A warm piece of browm paper, placed on a warm board, and well rubbed with a rubber eraser, -will cling to the board or to the wall until its electricity is dissipated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the latter part of the sixteenth century Dr. William Gilbert, a physician of Queen Elizabeth’s time, made a number of experiments with substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc. He noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet attracted only iron. Gilbert is called the founder of electrical science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Various Kinds of Electricity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today there is a very general knowledge of the fact that there are different forms of electricity, static (frictional, common), dynamic (voltaic), thermal, atmospheric, magnetic, posi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">his day, and inventor of the miners’ safety ■lamp which bears his- name, discovered the principle of the arc light, and nine years later exhibited the light itself before the Royal Institution of London, his carbon points being charcoal .from the willow, and his source of current a voltaic pile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great objection to the use of the are system of lighting is that the light is too intense for indoor purposes, and cannot be subdivided readily. Various inventors endeavored to subdivide the light. The greatest improvement was by an American, J. W. Starr, who employed carbon plates inside a glass vessel containing a vacuum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In March, 1829, Joseph Henry, of Albany, found that if a wire carrying electricity is fastened to or wound around a piece of soft iron, t Jie iron instantly becomes a magnet, the strength of which depends upon the amount of electricity and the length of the wire, and if the circuit is broken the iron instantly ceases to be magnetic. The whole science and business of telegraphy depends on this fact. The henry, as the practical unit of inductance, is named after this little known experimenter and discoverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the volt, the practical unit of electromotive force, is named after the Italian Volta, so the ohm, as the practical unit of resistance, is named after the euunciator of Ohm’s law, and the ampere, as the practical unit of current strength, is named after the French scientist of that name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1831 the great English scientist .'Faraday discovered that if a wire is moved in a magnetic field so as to cut across the lines of force a current will be generated in the wire. It is upon this principle that all dynamo-electric machines depend for their action, and it was this discovery that opened up the field of what might be called the commercial generation of current electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Facts and Theories Electrical</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The electric theory of matter has it that all matter in its final analysis is electrical in its nature, and the trend of all scientific investigation is now in that direction. Moreover, the earth itself is a huge dynamo, the sun is another, and the whirling of the worlds in their orbits partakes of the nature of an armature revolving in an electric generator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the apparent effects of electric and chemical activities of the sun is displayed in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">those great vortices called &quot;sun spots”. It is -• apparent that these are in some way connected with the electric storms and violent changes of magnetism that occur on the earth. It .goes r without saying that the electric storms on the sun far transcend anything that could ever be........■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">experienced on the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Electricity is a form of energy, like the energy of motion, heat, light or chemistry. All forms ' of energy are convertible into one another and can be measured by the same measure. As heat -™ is the simplest form, the British thermal unit (B. T. IL), that is, the amount of heat required............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to raise one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit has become the usual measure of energy, but the joule, or watt-second (one watt equals one volt times one ampere), is rapidly taking its..........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Conversion of Energy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any eonverson of energy into another form of energy is bound to result in some loss, and is usually discernible in heat. When heat, which is an irregular motion of the molecules without definite speed or direction, is converted into a regular motion, this loss by conversion is especially great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the transformation of the mechanical oner-.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">gy of waterfalls into electric energy, the water power is first converted into rotary motion by the water wheel, and then into electrical energy ■ by the electric generator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the transformation of the chemical energy ......</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of coal into electric energy, combustion first turns the chemical, energy into heat energy. This in turn is converted in the steam engine into '' mechanical energy, and when this in turn is finally converted into electric energy less than two percent of the energy of the coal goes out to the consumer over the wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the electric battery chemical energy can be converted directly into electrical energy to a limited extent, but the cost of the chemical on-ergy of metals is so high that this form is used only for bells, signaling purposes, and the like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The leading minds in the electrical world. are............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">doing much thinking and experhnenting with...............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a view to a direct conversion of coal into elec- ■■■•••• trical energy without the wasteful intervention of the steam engine. They are also working toward a direct conversion of electrical energy into light. No clue to the first of these problems lias yet presented itself, but the second problem is more hopeful of solution. If solved it will ili|||||||| electric lighting many times cheaper than any other form of illumination, and, with the Power Trust a thing of the past, will displace all other illnminants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Srep by step interrelations have been discovered between electricity, magnetism, light and gravity. The universe is now conceived of as lifting one of wave phenomena. Shorten the wave length of heat and we have light; shorten 1 he wave length of light and we have electricity; increase the wave length of electricity, that is, retard its movement, and we have heat or light, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The earth is immersed in whirls of magnetism and electricity, both of which powerfully affect man. The entire earth is charged with magnetic electricity. This charge is continuously escaping into the air, yet it is never permanently diminished, noris the charge in the air increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Metals, carbon and salt solutions are conductors of electricity, but there is no perfect conductor. Air, glass, rubber, paper and oil are insulators, but there is no perfect insulator. For purposes of electric transmission, conductors .are usually surrounded by insulators thick enough to withstand the electric pressure or voltage employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Atmospheric Electricity ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were on the point of making this subtitle sg;;„; . «F<sub>reo</sub> Electricity”, but not wanting to be responsible for the impression in anybody’s mind that </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Ah</span><span class="font5">! the Power Trust is really giving something . away, without a string to it, we thought better</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of it. Atmospheric electricity comes from a power plant not controlled by the Trust. Supposedly, it comes from the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">v.f There is always free electricity in the atmosphere. It may be detected by a pointed metal rod projecting into the air several feet and connected at its lower end to a gold leaf electroscope. When the rod is thus projected the leaves diverge. Kites and balloons have also been used to detect it. The intensity of the free electricity is greater in winter than in summer, and great- . cr in the middle of the day than at morning or night. In fine weather the potential increases with the altitude at the rate of about 30 volts per foot. In clear* weather the air is charged with positive electricity. In cloudy or rainy weather the conditions may change with the greatest rapidity from positive to negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Free electricity is ascribed variously to friction of the air upon the ground, to gradual oxidation of plant and animal life, to evaporation, to induction from the sun, and to differences of temperature. The huge lightning flashes are due to the condensation of watery vapor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each drop, as it moves through the air, accumulates free electricity on its surface. As the drops grow larger there is a decrease in the total surface of the drops which combined to form them, with the result that the electric potential rises until it overcomes the resisting power of the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lightning is still the most powerful electricity in the world. Artificial lightning of 5,000,000 volts has been produced. The voltage of the usual lightning flash is about 100,000,000 with 100,000 amperes. This represents a thousand billion horsepower and an energy of 4,000 watt hours and is all over in a few millionths of a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over an open field on a clear day the electrical condition of the atmosphere is such as to tend to move a positively charged body downward. This down-thrust is sufficient -when applied to the whole earth’s surface to reduce the negative charge of the earth, to one-half its initial value in ten minutes. The explanation of the maintenance of the earth’s negative charge under these conditions is one of the unsolved riddles of science.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hydroelectric Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cost of electric power derived from falling water does not differ much from that derived from coal by the steam engine, because of the greater investment required in developing a water power and transmitting the electric power to the place of consumption. Where coal is cheap the steam power may be more economical, but where water poorer can be developed cheaply, or where coal is expensive, ■water power is more economical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The extensive utilization of water power is not limited to natural waterfalls. Some of the most important developments are in locations where a fall of forty to four hundred feet extends over ten to fifty miles, and larger and more powerful dams are being constructed for this purpose constantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been proposed to dam the Niagara river at the foot of the gorge, thereby making another source of power equal to that of the present falls, and it is not at all unlikely that the dam will he built. The construction of such a dam would be a most interesting and expensive engineering project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We think of India, Palestine, Russia, Italy and Mexico as relatively backward countries, but water power development in all these countries is proceeding at a rate to cause us shortly to revise our opinions. Power means industry; industry means intelligence and progress, and looks toward liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jhelum river, in Kashmir’, India, has a fall of 2,480 feet in eighty miles, with a minimum flow of 30,000 gallons per second. A beginning has been made to develop the 1,000,000 electric horsepower here represented. It. is proposed to utilize this power by turning the limestone of the region into nitrate of lime, combining it until the nitrogen of the air. In time this product may find its way in large quantities to America and other countries, to replenish the failing powers of lands now less productive than formerly. How strange it would be to have rich and prosperous America looking to-ward poverty-stricken India as a source of wealth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Palestine, Russia, Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On October 1 (significant day), 1930, the Ru-tenberg power project at Naharaim, in the Jordan valley, Palestine, was completed, and 250 of the employees took leave of their work to go and found a new colony near by. It was then expected that by the first of the year 1931 all -the necessary machinery would be in place and the entire land of Palestine would thereby be provided with electrical energy for Lighting, heating and power purposes. The government will regulate the charges, and cheap power will be the result, unless the Power Trust manages to get hold of it. Jerusalem itself has had electric light and power for some years, as a result of a concession held by a British company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Russia had almost no electrical development at the time of the World War. Today there are .more than a thousand central stations serving as many villages, and $100,000,000 is being expended annually for electrical expansion. Every kind of fuel is being utilized, peat, oil waste, lignite and anthracite waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Russia’s most ambitious electrical project is the hydroelectric development of the Dnieper river in the Ukraine. The Dnieper station is to have a capacity of 800,000 horsepower and will be the largest in Europe. Three-fourths of the equipment was bought in America, and American engineers planned and built the dam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Italy is turning all its snows and glaciers and lakes and waterfalls into electricity. More than 7,000 of the 9,000 communities of the country are now supplied with electrical energy. Sixty percent of the power thus obtained is used for motor power, 15 percent for light and heat, 14 percent in the metallurgical and chemical industries, and 11 percent for electrifying railroads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The industrial electrification of Mexico is progressing at a most astounding rate, according to observers who have recently visited the land of the Montezumas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Wind and Sand Generation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wind power is inexhaustible, and as the winds blow more or less all over the earth’s surface it is not to be wondered at that electrical engineers have often looked in that direction for their power. Several firms are now engaged in the work of manufacturing wind-driven electric plants, and marked progress has been made in their design in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Great Northern Railway has used or will use windmills to charge block signal batteries. Holland has tried several experiments of like import, and they have been tried-also in the Lancashire (England) mill district, but in none of these places with marked success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In southern California there is a wind-power generator that produces electric current • whenever the wind is blowing four miles or more an hour. The generator consists of a tunnel lengthwise through the center of which runs a shaft carrying propellers. By the aid of a huge funnel the wind is concentrated on the propeller blades. These turn the shaft at 180 revoMtious a minute, developing 200 horsepower. Electric controls automatically keep the large funnel squar --ly in the face of the strongest wind. A larger plant, to produce 1,400 horsepower, was under way the last we knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is known that particles of flying sand and dirt generate electric current. During sand storms shocks are suffered from contacts with fence wires, radio antennae and antennas. The dryness of the air prevents the dissipation of the electricity accumulated. In volcanic eruptions the dust and smoke commonly become charged, resulting in continuous thunder.....and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">January</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7, 1931 </span><span class="font5">lightning, with terrifying effects upon the onlookers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Electric Storage Battery</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an electric storage battery, while it is being charged electrical energy is being converted into chemical energy; when it is being discharged the chemical energy is being reconverted into electric energy. A device of this kind is a necessity where a supply of electrical energy is needed to be instantly available under isolated conditions over long periods of time. An automobile or airplane without a good reliable storage battery would be like a horse without any breathing apparatus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">\Ve do not say that a man is a storage battery, but he is not so dissimilar to it as he might be. (iccasionally there is a man who is overcharged. Frederick Stone, a chauffeur at Holsworthy, England, cannot use a telephone without receiving a shock, cannot walk or drive without insulation in his shoes, and can locate buried metals. When he once undertook to wear his wife’s wrist watch it came all to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is well known that there is a connection between electricity and muscular work. The will ‘connects’ with a portion of the brain and sends out an order, which we know travels through the nerves to the muscles. Electricity is evidently the medium of exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A dog lover reports having a tiny Pomeranian puppy, weighing eight ounces, which showed every appearance of dying. The owner held him between his two hands several times, for a few minutes each time, and he rallied. The owner believed the improvement w’as brought about by the electricity from his own body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is said that the electricity flowing out of a human body can he amplified and photographed, and that it can be seen just at dusk or twilight under the following conditions: A large, strong man is stood five feet in front of a perfectly black background while the observer takes a position twenty to forty feet away and gazes steadily at him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is said that when conditions and distances are right anybody of good sight will see a faint radiance emanating from the man and outlining him on the black background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Achievements of the Engineers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have not much use for the financiers of the Power Trust, but nobody can view the work of their engineers without considerable admiration. About 20,000,000 of the 30,000,000 residences of the United States have been wired, and the rate of wiring is at about 1,500,000 residences per annum for those as yet unwired. Besides this there are 3,500,000 commercial users and 1,050,000 power and miscellaneous customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States Department of the Interior estimates that the average family of four persons in the United States has such a share of the 80,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours of electric power as would give them each the services of eleven able-bodied mechanical laborers working eight hours daily, every day in the year, at a total annual cost for the eleven of $75 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Somewhere in the country 17,700,000 flatirons are in use, their number being added to or replaced at the rate of 3,000,000 a year. The vacuum cleaner output is about 1,000,000 a year; toasters, 1,200,000 a year; percolators, 800,000 a year; waffle irons, 600,000 a year. The 10,500,000 people of New York state use about oneseventh of all the electricity produced in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than a million persons in the country are now more or less conversant with electrical terms and practices. Mr. Edison says we have so far progressed that there is now no reason for human backs to strain, or arms to lift, or legs to stagger under heavy loads, when electricity is so much better able to do the work. In the electrical work of the country something like 20,000 carloads of copper were used last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Every Product Utilizes Electricity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is hardly a thing made or delivered today that does not come in contact in some way with the electric current. Take out of a home the electric lights, electric flatirons, electric washers, electric ranges, electric refrigerators, electric heaters, radios, telephones, electric bells, toasters, percolators and waffle irons and you have taken out much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take the electrical devices out of offices and factories and there would be little left today except the walls, and yet what has been done is as nothing compared with what is yet to be done, and will be done under the perfect administration of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even now the transportation men are prophesying that in ten years more most of the railroads bounded by Boston, Buffalo, Pittsburgh and 'Washington 'will be electrified. The roads </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">can be</span><span class="font5"> lighted with electric lights to good advantage too. A capital investment of $3,680,000,000 (most of it water) had a year ago an. output valued at $2,700,000,000. Between 1907 and 1927 the gross revenue from the sale of electricity was multiplied by ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All communities of 5,000 or more in the United States are now supplied with electric service, and 25 percent of the hamlets of 250 population are also supplied. Since 1923 more than 4,000 rural centers have been added to the list of communities served.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At its plant at Fourteenth street and East river the New York Edison Company has a turbogenerator which provides 215,000 horsepower, or 160,000 kilowatts. It weighs 1,200 tons, and is 21½ feet by 24½ feet by 87 feet. The boilers are as high as an eight-story building and contain sixty-nine miles of tubes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Direct and Alternating Current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Direct current flows along the wire in one direction. All electric batteries give direct current. It is generally preferred for electric railroading, and often for electric lighting, especially in the centers of large cities. Direct current is required for electrolytic work, and for the charging of storage batteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternating current flows first in one direction and then in another. The number of double reversals or cycles per second is called the frequency of the alternating current. The current I hat is generated at a frequency of twenty-five cycles per second is called a low frequency current and is used for industrial purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The current that is generated at a frequency of sixty cycles per second is employed for illumination., When the lights are said to flicker the frequency is lower than it should be. When sufficiently high the eye is tricked and cannot discern the pauses in the flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">High frequency currents are alternating currents reversing very rapidly, often a hundred thousand or a. million times per second. Sometimes they are not constant in value, but die out and then start again, thus becoming oscillating currents. Such are used mainly for wireless telegraphy and telephony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alternating currents have the advantage that they can be raised in voltage by stationary apparatus called transformers, and thus transmitted to a distance, and lowered in voltage for use. .Because of this all large electric generating systems now produce alternating current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where direct current is required, it is produced from the alternating current supply by means of rotary converters or'ji tionary devices called rectifiers. One of the interesting discoveries of recent years is that a little piece of copper, slightly more than an inch square, and so thin that it takes sixty-five or them to make a pile an inch high, has the unique property of carrying a current in one direction only, from its face toward its center. Because of this property it can be used to turn alternating current into direct current, and alter- - --nating current delivered to a consumer is readily converted into direct current on the promises. The device, ‘kuprox,’ is said to be easy to make when one knows how ; and the material, copper, is inexpensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Long Distance Transmission</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the distances to which electric power is transmitted exceeds 15 or 20 miles it is usually spoken of as long distance transmission. Ju America electrical transmission systems Juive reached a maximum of 250 miles in distance . • ■ covered, and 220,000 volts in the line pressure, &lt;■ economically applied to the transmitted current. .A•'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An invention of the last few years, called the..........</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘series capacitor’, is a great aid in the transmission of alternating current. With the aid of this invention the economical transmission of power can be effected over lines spanning 500 miles between generators and consuming devices. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Germany, by way of Sweden and Denmark. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wr </span><span class="font5">a power line 625 miles long. It is claimed that all the engineering details have been worked out. Towers rising above the sea would support cables carrying 1,000,000 horsepower at 380,000 volts. For several years hydroelectric power has been transmitted from Sweden to Denmark by submarine cable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only a beginning has been made in the trails-mission of electric power from, the coal mines. <sup>: </sup>Everything is held back by the outrageous prices <sub>: </sub>charged the consumers by those who control the •„&gt; Power Trust. If these men were willing to charge a price bearing some reasonable relation to the -z-cost of production, all the work of the countrv could be done by electricity produced at the...............</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">mine, and the transportation of coal would be ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The railroads would.not like that idea, for large share of their business has been the carriage of coal; but the railroads have been great sinners, too. They have tried so hard to gouge the last cent out of the people for railway fares •that now the people are traveling otherwise and the railway cars go through the country almost empty of passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">--■-There is a new insulating material, developed by a Russian investigator. It resembles a light varnish, and a thin coating of it is reported to ;-:arvo as a substitute for the bulky and more costly porcelain insulators. The use of this new insulator will probably reduce costs of construe-t ion of new lines materially.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• <sub>s</sub> Speaking of long distance transmission, that was a great achievement when Signor Marconi, ■from his yacht in the harbor of Genoa, Italy, closed a circuit in Sydney, Australia, 11,000 miles away, for the opening of the electrical e</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">x</span><span class="font5">hibition in the Sydney Town Hall. Signor Marconi said of this event that “it points the way to a. future day when there will be no elec-i rie wires, and all current of electric power will be transmitted directly through the air in any ■direction and quantity desired”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Altura BSazdtfs Namesake</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•- The incandescent lamp in its modern form was named after Ahura Mazda, the Persian god of light. Incidentally, the Mazda lamp of today gives off more than six times as much light, watt for watt, as did the carbon lamp of fifty years ago, and it has also a much longer service life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">......The incandescent lamp is an almost perfect light, as it gives off no waste products of any kind and does not cause fires unless held in close pnoximity to muslin or paper or other inflammable materials for a considerable length of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first successful lamp was. produced by Edison in 1879. In three years it was in commercial use, and in ten years was in general use all over America and in parts of Europe. The present annual consumption of incandescent lamps in the United States is about 400,000,000, or approximately three lamps per capita.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Broadway, the brightest spot in the world on a dark night, has 20,880 electric signs between The Battery and 135th Street. It takes 1,309,918 lamps to keep these signs aglow, or it did take that many before the signs were changed to neon, argon and xenon gas-filled tubes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">c - Some homes are now being fitted with Cooper-Hewitt mercury vapor lamps. The tubes, perhaps an inch in diameter, are twenty to fifty inches long, and are backed by a metallic reflector. When the current flow’s, a little mercury is allowed to vaporize in the tube and a greenish white light of great intensity is obtained. Such lamps are widely used in factories, closely reproducing daylight conditions, and obviating strain on the eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some homes are also being fitted with electric lights which produce ultra-violet rays from an ordinary lighting fixture. At a distance of three feet such a lamp will give a sunburn in fifteen hours of exposure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has been discovered that ordinary electric lamps may be used for secret signaling. By properly screening the lamps with certain materials only the infra-red rays, which are invisible to the naked eyes, are released. These are received at various distances by sensitive buzzers wliicli sound in response to the rays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Some liecent Applications</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An electric light which can be blown out or blov.ni into illumination by a breath, a device so sensitive that a passing shadow or a dewdrop may turn on the lights of a city, start or stop a. railroad train, or maneuver a battleship, give advance warning of thunderstorms, turn off the fuel supply of gas and oil stoves in case the flame is accidentally extinguished, count people, autos or products passing given points, send out alarms in case of fire or intrusion; an electric eye which fires a gun at a prisoner trying to scale the wall, and sounds an alarm simultaneously; an artificial eardrum, still somewhat complicated and dangerous, enabling deaf persons to hear by means of electric waves transmitted direct through the auditory nerve; an electric calculator by which the most difficult mathematical problems are solved rapidly by lightly touching tire numbers involved in the problem; the fissure detector, previously described in these columns, which automatically picks out the weak spots in a rail; the electric prospector which locates orc bodies on the principle that certain ores offer far less resistance to electric current than ordinary rock; the application of the photo-electric cell to the manufacture of paper, so that it automatically adjusts the machinery when the paper is getting too thick or too thin; the robots that run power stations and record their impulses miles away; an .elec-trie arrangement for sandblasting and candling eggs; the use of the electric eye for sorting objects by weight and color as fast at they can be conveyed; an electrically operated paper-pasting machine, which does away with messy paste tables, pails and other equipment; these are but a few of the more recent adaptations of electricity to human work. It is applied to every conceivable problem, from squeezing oranges at a soda fountain to unloading 12,000 tons of ore in half a day from the hold of a vessel. There are lumber camps that are completely electrified, from the felling of the trees with portable saws, aided by a few highly skilled axe strokes, to the loading of the logs on the waiting trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Electric Heating</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The conversion of electric energy into heat is usually more expensive than direct generation of heat by combustion, and is therefore commercially practicable only for the production of excessively high temperatures, for cooking, for flatirons and for certain purposes where the temperature has to be perfectly controlled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, a start has been made in house heating, experiments having been made at Erie, Pa., and at Fort Wayne, Ind. In the Fort Wayne test the method consisted of heating large storage tanks of water, practically huge thermos bottles, using current only at night, when it can be obtained at least cost, and releasing the stored heat in the home as required. The success of this plan depends entirely upon the rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some advantages of electric heating are absolute cleanliness, absence of combustion or flames, automatic temperature control, no noise, no fuel shortage, heat available instantly when required. This method of heating could be made very popular if the Power Trust would be willing to sell its current for say only three to four times what it costs to make it, but when they persist in wanting ten times that amount, they kill the goose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some localities where reasonable current rates are enjoyed (and they are not many), an electric radiator has been used. Each is an. independent unit and functions for three months on a pint of water. Steam is generated by contact with water between the poles of an electrode. The current is automatically shut off if the water evaporates or is lost by leakage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Adaptation® to Agriculture &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Germany the farms have been electrified for twenty years; the rates are low. About onefourth of the farms of New York state have electric current. In California the proportion is somewhat larger. Of the 195,000 farms in Indiana, only 15,163 are electrified. Experiments conducted in twenty-three states disclosed 227 applications to the buildings and barnyards. Plowing, harrowing, planting, harvesting and reaping are still preempted by horses and traction engines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the uses noted are lighting barn, cow yard, washroom and milk storage room; milking; pumping ice water through milk cooler; refrigerating the storage tank; elevating grain to overhead bins; grinding feed; clipping and grooming cows; turning the separator; driving bottling equipment, and operating bottle-washing machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An electrically driven vegetable-tying machine handles 150 dozen bunches of celery an hour. Electrically driven blowers have been used to dry damp hay. An electric screen door electrocuted 2,500 flies a day at the door of a dairy barn. Truck gardeners have killed many insects by the use of electric lights with pans of kerosene fastened below them. By the use of electric current mushroom growers can control temperatures exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experiments in the electrification of the soil have been made, but -while some have made extravagant claims as to what could be done by this means, another who tried ripening strawberries in forty days by that method declared that each ripe berry cost him about $6. In the latter instance two 1200-watt electric lamps were set four feet above the plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We still hear occasionally of the electric plow, invented by Hamilton L. Roe, of Leroy, N. Y. The inventor claims that an electric charge passing through the soil makes the plant food in. it. more readily available and eliminates the need of fertilizer, and also kills weeds and poisons and makes the plants less susceptible to droughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Discovering that ladybugs live on mealy bugs, and that mealy bugs were eating up their fruit, California orchardists have built cabins for the ladybugs and kept them at a warm., even temperature so that they would be contented and. stay on the job of exterminating their common foe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">St, Elmo’s Fire</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the strangest things that happens at sea is the luminous body which can be seen on wet nights perched upon or skipping about the masts and rigging of the ship. Sometimes the flame is single, and sometimes double. The Roman soldiers called the single flame Helene, and the double one Castor and Pollux, and believed these manifestations of static electricity to be ;gods, and good ones at that. The modern sailor . has a better understanding of the phenomenon and calls it “St. Elmo’s fire”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">St. Elmo’s fire has also been observed flitting about Pike’s peak, and on one occasion was so brilliant that an airplane was sent to see if possibly some hikers might be stranded on the mountain top. However, a thorough aerial search of the mountain revealed no trace of any persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another curious manifestation of electricity on the briny deep, or in it, is the electric eel, which can discharge sufficient electricity to kill an animal of considerable size. When in full power it is able to knock down a man and benumb his affected limb in the most painful manner for several hours. The eel is about six feet long, and five-sixths of its length is a current-gencrutmg apparatus. After shocking a victim it has io retire for a considerable time to get its batteries recharged. An eel properly hooked up will light an electric bulb, run a toy train or operate an egg beater. In South America the natives capture them by driving horses among them. The eels attack the horses, sometimes so painfully that they fall and are drowned. After the attacks the eels are readily captured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is as good a place as any to mention that electrically-driven passenger liners are or soon will be in operation on the high seas. One of the chief advantages claimed or hoped for electric propulsion is the greater flexibility of control. The Dollar Line is having two such vessels built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Some Recent Meas</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. E. 0. Hulburt, of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, has announced his belief that eighty or ninety miles above the earth there are three great belts of electric current continually swirling like tidal waves. There are two daytime currents, one immediately above . the other, one flowing eastward and the other westward. At night another current flows continually eastward. These currents influence radio transmission at sea, produce variation of magnetic compasses, and alter the world weath</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is believed that much of the light given off by shooting stars is electrical. The air is known to be highly electrified at the levels at which shooting stars begin to be visible and powerful electric action appears to take place when a solid particle enters the atmosphere at the speed at which shooting stars travel. The shooting star is therefore an electric light, at least in part, traveling at a high rate of speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British government is experimenting with a device, the Harrison Wood patent, for which most remarkable things are claimed. It is said that if this little machine is plugged into the socket of a lamp holder on a household lighting circuit it will light six 100-watt 200-volt lamps for the cost of the original one, and has actually done this over a period of months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A doctor has stirred things by expressing his belief that chemical activity in the cells of the human body produces electricity, that, this electricity maintains the life process, and that lack of it finally causes death. He believes the human current has a great influence over all our emotions, including love, and thinks this may explain why certain people are attracted to one another, or vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Marconi’s beam shot from the harbor' of Genoa, Italy, to Sydney, Australia, and hitting his mark so fairly as to light a chain of lamps 11,000 miles away, leads some to hope that ere long the airplane 10,000 feet above us will be able to have its storage batteries replenished without coming down to earth, and to fear that in war these rays will be powerful enough to paralyze everything in their path, detonate explosives, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prodigious Infant</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fifty years ago there was no electrical business. It was an infant, barely able to cross the threshold. The first incandescent lighting industrial station was opened at Pearl Street, Ne*w York, in September, 1882, with a load of about 400 lamps distributed among the buildings of the neighborhood. It was ten years after that before even the largest companies were seriously thinking of operating machines by electric motors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1890, when electric lights were first installed in. the White House, only one person dared to turn the lights on or off. The chief electrician turned the lights on at night and came</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">around and turned them off in the morning. Later this lighting and the service of turning the lights on and off was extended to the bedrooms, and sometimes the bedroom lights ‘blazed’ all night because nobody dared turn them out. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The electric light companies got their first start by selling current to the electric street railways. That was only twenty years ago; and now the street railways are done for and are rapidly passing out. Electrical engineering as a profession is only about fifteen years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■Today the telephone, the telegraph and'the radio have become domestic and international necessities; and when we add to this list the applications of electricity for light, power, transportation, heating and household appliances, man has in his hands the most prodigious infant he has ever tried to carry. Indeed, the infant is now trying to carry the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Electrocution Items</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Electrocutions are recognized as of three classes: (1) Where several horsepoAver are used the direct effect of the large power upon the body may cause its destruction by heat. (2) A very heavy discharge, as of lightning, may cause the mechanical destruction of vital organs. (3) A lesser discharge may cause paralysis of the nervous system, stoppage of the heart and respiratory organs. In these latter cases resuscitation is possible when external heat to the body, artificial respiration and cardiac stimulants are used simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When loosely touched with, dry hands a 100-vo H circuit may hardly give any sensation, while, grasped with wet hands, a 50-volt circuit may be unbearable. Pressures of 500 to 600 volts are considered as still safe. At Sing Sing prison 300 volts of alternating current has produced death and 1,500 volts is virtually certain to do so. With continuous current 3,000 volts may be required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet it seems that electric current can be de-amperized, as coffee is de-caffeined or tobacco is de-nicotined, and with such a de-amperized current a child by the name of Harry Church had 85,000 volts passed through his body, and gave out sparks two inches long, in his father’s laboratory, and without hurting him in the least. Better not try this experiment unless you know just how it is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A person, dead or alive, is a conductor of electricity, because he is made up mostly of water. If a person is in contact with an electric current those rescuing him should break his &lt;&nbsp;contact with the circuit by means of some insulated tool, such as a long, dry stick, or a long, dry rope. Where the voltage is under 6,600 a coat may be used for a rope by throwing it around the wire with the loop thus made.</span></p>

Then it carries it 100 miles to Birmingham, Alabama, and charges the Birmingham householders for lighting purposes 8.5 cents a kilowatt hour, or over four times what the Birmingham people would have to pay if they lived in Toronto.

How this can eventuate in any lasting good to the medical profession is hard to see.

When it stopped being the faith of a minority, so deadly in earnest that they had to live underground, and became the superficial and conventional faith of a majority, the church lost its distinctly Jesus-like character. Then began a series of accommodations, the heritage of which rendered it almost powerless in the face of war, of social waste, of individual exploitation and personal ostentation, of all the elements in our civilization in fact which rendered it definitely anti-Christian. Our most urgent task is not the extension of Christianity as a conventional majority faith; it is rather the preservation of its essential Christian quality and purpose, the preservation of the power to look at the world with realistic eyes, see where our ways of life deny the validity of Christ, and then to fling ourselves against those pagan forces.

The Balfour declaration about Palestine was a gesture, not merely on our part, but on the part of the Allies, to secure that valuable support. It was prepared after much consideration, not merely of its policy, but its actual wording by the representatives of all the allied and associated countries, including America and our dominion premiers. Now, without consulting the United States, France, Italy, Belgium or our own dominions, the British government issues this statement, which in substance is a revocation of a good part of a solemn pledge given at a most solemn moment. We shall not reconcile the Arab, but we shall alienate an even more powerful race and, what is worse, shall see British honor tarnished. We shall be held up throughout the world as &quot;perfidious Albion’.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Bishop Not So Hard Up</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">F ANY of our subscribers, noticing that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholic bishop of Detroit is borrowing money, are worried for fear he is getting hard up, let them take heart. In the first place the bishop is borrowing only $128,000, whereas we have the word of the Wells-Dickey Company, of Minneapolis, that these five-percent mortgage bonds being offered for sale “are the obligation of the bishop of Detroit, whose assets exceed his debts by more than $135,000,000”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This does not mean that this is all that the bishop has been able to accumulate as a result of the “hell-fire” and “purgatory” burdens permitted to rest so nicely on the backs of the kitchen mechanics, day laborers, and other drudges that have helped to scrape the pile together, for the same authority tells us that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE CATHOLIC BISHOP OF DETROIT holds title to properties valued in excess of $150,000,000, and has debts of less than ten percent thereof. The diocese of Detroit, established March 8, 1833, is the seventh largest- of the one hundred and twenty-one archdioceses and dioceses of the United States, and reports a Catholic population in excess of 635,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bishop has until January 15, 1939, to pay back the little loan of $128,000, and without a question will be able to meet these little items as they become due, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">unless,</span><span class="font5"> unless something happens in the meantime, in which case the bonds may be worth about 30d for the whole batch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to reflect that if the other 120 archdioceses and dioceses were as well off as the bishop of Detroit, the 121 gentlemen would have among them the nice little pile of $18,000,000,000, which, when you come to think of it, is a ; nice little chunk of property, worth about as much as all the railroads in the United States put together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">NEW industry has developed until it has spread like a big cloud over the whole earth. This business is that of the expert who searches the books of the Telephone Trust, the Power Trust, etc., looking for items running into the millions which can be added to the so-■ called “fair valuation” of the properties. In actual operation one of these firms of identifiers of fictitious values made the Telephone Trust fair valuation out to be $250,000,000 more than the majority of the New York state public service commission made it out to be. The object of the boosted valuation is not for taxation purposes, so that the Trust can help the people by paying a bigger share of the taxes. Bless you, no!

<p><span class="font11">F</span><span class="font5">RIENDS of your magazine have requested me to write my experience with aluminum ware for cooking purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I had used it for a number of years in my home, not knowing anything about its harmful effects on the system. My health became much impaired, gas very distressing after eating, pain in back of head, very nervous and weak. Of course I doctored with both medicine and chiropractic, also dieted, trying in every way possible to get relief and to find the cause of my trouble, but nothing did any good whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two years ago last winter, Dr. Betts’ articles in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> came to my attention and I decided to discard all aluminum cooking ware. My health began to improve slowly at first, until after two years I felt better and my friends remarked how well I was looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now for the real part of my story: The 22d of May this year, a drunken man ran into our car, demolishing it, cutting a gash in my forehead and fracturing my hip. I was rushed to a hospital. After a few days there I began bloating. The longer I stayed, the worse I became, until the gas was so bad around my left lung and my heart, and the pain so great, I almost died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My husband and I both told the doctor and nurse that we were quite sure aluminum poisoning was causing the trouble. The doctor said, “Oh, surely not’” But nevertheless he went to the nurse, also to the cook, and had my food prepared in enamel ware after that. I was so full of the poison that I did not get rid of it for some time, about three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I tell my friends aluminum is all right for airplanes and washing machines, but wish I had the po'wer to banish it from every hospital and home in the land, for I know it is causing much unnecessary illness and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If my experience will be the means of anyone’s discarding it, I feel it will not have been in vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Farming in Wisconsin </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Edward J. J de (Wisconsin)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5"> AM a farmer in Wisconsin; have a small farm of my own. But, but, we are not making a living; we are just merely existing. We get,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">so to say, nothing for our goods, and have to ...... pay exorbitant prices for whatever we buy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For instance, we are selling cattle, the best for eight cents on the hoof, down to two cents. Just think of it! Twenty dollars for a thousand-pound cow! Then they kill it and sell us back the meat for twenty-five and thirty-five cents a pound. Yes, they charge us two dollars a hundredweight for the fertilizer that they take out of the cow’s stomach. Honestly, I cannot see the end of it. Nothing but dishonest people robbing the poor people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I have a wife and four children. The oldest are two boys, nineteen and seventeen years old. They have been out of work for over a year now. All around here people are being laid off. Factories are closing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The farmer now gets thirty-four cents for new wheat, twenty-two cents for rye, eighteen cents for barley, and six cents for oats. It costs twelve cents to thresh a bushel; and binder twine is eleven to twelve cents a pound. I enclose my last card, so that you can see what we receive for our poultry; six to fifteen cents a pound. For fresh eggs we get fourteen cents a dozen. For new potatoes we get seventy-five cents a bushel.</span></p>

There is no doubt whatever about the displacement of these men, but the unemployment figures show that if these have been able to find new positions it has been only at the expense of others whose places they have taken.

<p><span class="font6">More About California’s Old Age Pensions</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font5">T IS my understanding that the so-called pension'for the blind and aged in California is not a pension in any sense of the word. It is designated as &quot;state and county aid for the blind and aged”; but it is nothing more than charity pure and simple, and so considered by those dispensing, it. The reason, I am told, that the “aid” is not a “'pension” is that any blind person or aged person would be legally entitled to it regardless of financial resources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The way it is, the officials extend any percentage of the maximum they please to whoever can produce satisfactory reason why the aid is needed. From my experience with the welfare bureaus it seems that the heads of the various welfare bureaus are vested with full power to say who shall and who shall not receive the aid, and how much shall be received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is very difficult to secure the aid either for the blind or for the aged; that is, in some eases. I have a blind, invalid father (totally blind for years), an invalid for whom it was necessary for me to apply for the state aid for the blind.-I have my own living to make. I support my mother, but I could not support my father too. Mrs.----------, the head of the ---welfare bureau,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">would recommend only $— a month for my father, and $— lie received. But an acquaintance of mine whose salary is almost twice as much as mine has a blind mother. In this case the maximum of $50 was recommended and received. It seems to me there is a great deal of injustice being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know of two blind young women. According to my understanding of the law, each is entitled to $50 a month. They live together, and live all alone. But the welfare bureau refused them more than $30 a month each. If I am correctly informed tins is all the money they have, and they have no one to do anything for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By a CttlifoniiaH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know two old persons, husband and wife, who it seems to me arc each entitled to $20 a month as old age aid. But again the welfare bureau would allow the two but $50. This, a s far as I know, is all they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">My experience with the so-called “welfare-workers” has not been pleasant. I think the term 4s a misnomer. Personally, I think they are devils. They make one’s life a veritable ecclesiastical “hell of fire and brimstone”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one has burial expenses laid'aside, the welfare workers refuse to aid one until that small sum is lived up; then one is buried in the potter’s field. If one has a small home worth just a few hundred dollars, that home must be sold, and the money completely spent, before statwmiid-county aid is advanced. If there are any relatives, near or distant, or any -in-laws, near or-far, they are all interviewed; and if by any hook or crook it is possible to refuse the aid, it is done. The welfare workers have favorites to whom the maximum aid. is granted without hesitancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I hope I have given you enough for you to obtain a slight understanding of conditions. The cases I might recite would fill a book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the aid is granted, one is tormented once a month with a visit from the “worker”. They are so afraid one will receive some material help from some other source. In some -eases the visits are omitted; but I am unable to learn how to have them stopped. I have tried to get the visits to my home stopped, as it makes both my parents very nervous; but I have not been able to do so. However, in the case of ray acquaintance, she has never had one call. I fee! this is showing partiality and injustice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r.

<p><span class="font11">N</span><span class="font5">OT in years has the whole public health structure of the United States and Canada been so shaken up as it was August 27 as a result of an address by Dr. Robert Hutchison at the British Medical Association convention at Winnipeg, Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Hutchison took as his subject, &quot;The Pursuit of Health/’ and stated that he was in accord with G. K. Chesterton that “of all human things, the search for health is the most unhealthy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not what Dr. Hutchison said which made it so startling, because numerous other physicians have expressed the same sentiment; but what came as such a shock was the fact that Doctor Hutchison ranks so high in his profession, being physician to the London Hospital and an author on medical subjects, and also because his audience consisted of so many leading British, American and Canadian physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“'Public .Health Is Purchasable” has been the favorite slogan of medical propagandists who have been using boards of health as if they were the lawfully constituted advertising agencies for medical societies to exploit questionable and dangerous forms of medical treatment and to make their use compulsory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Health boards have boldly asserted that the larger the appropriations they received the more lives they would save. And now comes Dr. Hutchison and tells the whole world that “fussiness about health increases fears and impairs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■■ ■ the serenity which is the basis both of health and of happiness. The old ignorance about the body and stolid resignation to its ills”, he says, “was probably a more healthy attitude, and certainly a happier one, than the modern curiosity and overanxiety”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I anticipate that a celebrated physician will immediately come forward to the rescue of boards of health and maintain that Dr. Hutchison was ■wrong, but the significant thing about the address by Dr. Hutchison is that it brings out so forcefully that an important part of the medical</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Odd Way to Sharpen a Blade </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fellow Sufferers : Do you want a real good shave? Then take your old Gillette blade, and a trusty drinking glass, one of the smooth variety. Bun the glass full of water, then empty it out, and take your blade, lay it against the inside of the glass, press your finger on the center of the blade, and, holding the glass still, </span><span class="font5">profession do not believe in constantly frightening the public about disease. And where there exists so much difference of opinion in the medical profession about the results of medical propaganda under the guise of “health” teaching I submit that it should be left to private endeavor and not forced upon an unsuspecting public by boards of health at taxpayers’ expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I will give you a few extracts from a report of the address by Dr. Hutchison as published in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This overanxiety may show itself in one of three ways. First, it may affect the individual as regards his own health; and this we may speak of as individual hypochondriasis. Secondly, it may be exhibited, and more pardonably, by normal persons in regard to the health of those near and dear to them, a vicarious hypochondriasis. Thirdly, the overanxiety may assume an epidemic form involving whole communities or nations; and this I would call national hypochondriasis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Parents in regard to their’ children are typical examples of those who are overanxious about the health of others. The rearing of an infant is now regarded as a job requiring the combined knowledge of a chemist, a psychologist and a public health officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There is no doubt that the atmosphere of f</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">us</span><span class="font4">s and anxiety in which so many children are brought up reacts upon them unfavorably, with the result that nervous troubles of one sort or another are commoner today in childhood than they ever were.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Let's see. Why, you are a man now I Why sure you are ’ Let’s see. Yes, you will be thirty-five the fifth of next May. Well, time surely does slip by. Why, it doesn’t seem that it has been any time since your mother was a little curly-haired girl, with your eyes and smile, and I was teasing her as we went to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And then came the time when she returned from the young ladies’ seminary, the same laughing, mischievous girl, to me, but to others an accomplished young lady. And then came days which were alternately full of the greatest happiness-or deepest despair; for I was like any other young fellow who is in love. And then came my great triumph! and no king ever led his queen to his throne wuth more pride than I did mine; for she was a queen to my humble home. And then such joy as we had in our little heaven on earth! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It seems that I can still see her as she went about the place with that holy, happy smile on her dear face or sat stitching on the little garments that were to be yours. And then came that fearful night of agony that I knelt by her bedside and prayed frenziedly, regardless of the doctor and nurse, that she might live through the terrible trial. Oh, the horror of it! I can never forget that night. I know that I cursed myself that night, and I think that I almost cursed you also, my boy; but at last it was over and she was sleeping the sleep of exhaustion, and I was holding you a little red bit of a creature in my arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After this, came more happy days. How proud we 'were of you! and how fast you grew! My! My! It didn’t seem any time till you were a husky lad going to school and getting into mischief as all healthy boys will. And then came the time</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">OLDEN 'AGE</span><span class="font5"> No. 290 is before me. Regarding the article, “An Essay on Eugenies,” by K. C. MacArthur, I must say I agree with almost the entire article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two or three points, however, on which I must disagree with Mr. MacArthur, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On page 81, first column, lines four to seven, it is stated, “The eugenists believe that they can eliminate a high proportion of vice and crime by restricting the reproduction of those persons who fail to possess normal self-control.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So far, so good! But who, may I ask, ever gave to any organization of men the right to deprive their less fortunate fellow men of their Godgiven right of exercising their divinely sanctioned powers of reproduction? Does not the golden rule say, “Do unto others as you would have others do unto you”? Are the eugenists following the golden rule when they attempt to deprive some of their fellow men of one of the birthrights of mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">::: : Surely the eugenists would not want some of their fellow men to attempt to deprive them, their own selves, of one of the inalienable rights that God gave to them! No one but Almighty God has the right to take away from any person his or her God-given privilege of reproduction. And most assuredly the Lord God has given to no man or organization of men the right to prevent any of their brother men and sister women from attaining to the estate of fatherhood and motherhood. On the contrary, God has caused it to be written, “multiply and increase.” This is a positive command from Almighty God to all men and women who desire to have children, to exercise their powers of procreation. That being the case, then who dares to say or command otherwise ? Surely no one, except presumptuous persons or those who have no regard for the rights of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for the “simple methods” of birth control, did it ever occur to the well-meaning but deluded eugenists that had our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers gone so far as to practice birth control, most of us, including some of the eugenists, would not be here today. Let the eugenists chew upon this dainty morsel, and have some reflections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The eugenists claim that their aims are “to be brought about by education, by appeals to family pride, to patriotism and to religious idealism”. Hm-m-m! Let us see. “Education” is all right and therefore it passes the board, is okehed and put in glass. Now we turn to “family pride”. Alack and alas, not so good! Pride is an abomination in the sight of the Lord. Therefore “family pride” has to go overboard. Next on the program is “a narrow-minded and selfish hatred and contempt of other people who are just as good as we”. Therefore we would at once consign this, too, to “the infernal regions”, if there were any such place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lastly, there is “religious idealism”. But “religious idealism” is nothing less than religious bigotry in disguise. So we promptly rush “religious idealism” to the gallow<sup>T</sup>s and swing it into limbo. And that leaves, ah, yes, that leaves “'education”, which is all right for everybody, so long as it is not the power trust variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, dear me! how are we going to educate men and women to do so and so, as long as they are imperfect human creatures? Is not this truly a task for Christ’s kingdom? This kind of education requires the power and love and wisdom and justice of Jehovah God to rightly and fully accomplish, even supposing that education could do it, which this writer denies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Constitution of the United States guarantees that each and every person in this land shall be secure in his rights and person, and shall have and enjoy the equal protection of the laws. One of the rights of every person is the right to marry and reproduce his own species. Hence, any law, statute or ordinance passed by any state, town, city or community that seeks as its object the taking away from certain men and women the God-given right of procreation is in violation of the United States Constitution, and cannot be legally or lawfully enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore, a surgical operation that would deprive any man or woman of the power of procreation would be in violation of the United States Constitution, -which guarantees that every person in this land shall be secure in his person. Such an operation would therefore be unconstitutional, and hence illegal, as well as violating God’s law upon the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for “normal self-control”, did Adam exercise “normal self-control” when he sinned ? Every person who is acquainted with the Bible record must answer in the negative. And yet God did not take away from him a function divinely given. A lesson here for all eugenists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for restricting the reproduction of defective offspring. If God will not do this, and it has to be admitted that He is not doing so, then what right has puny and imperfect man to attempt to do so? None whatever. The right, to take away from men and women the power of procreation is a right that God Almighty never gave to any man, but which He keeps in His own power, and in the Millennial age God will then exercise this right after a sufficient number of persons have been born on this earth to fulfil His purposes. Hence it would be presumptuous for any group of men and women to attempt to arrogate to themselves what is strictly a matter for the Almighty to attend to in His own good time and way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though there are defective children being born every day, do not the Scriptures reveal tliat an opportunity to secure life everlasting in a state of perpetual peace, love, health and happiness is to be given unto all men ? And therefore is it not true that the present few short years of wretched and unhappy life are to be followed by an eternity of love, happiness and bliss? In other words, children, even if born with mental and moral as well as physical handicaps, will have the unspeakable boon and privilege of marching up the highway of health and holiness during the Millennial age, enjoy the blessings of restitution, be restored to perfect health, perfect manhood and perfect bodies, and then, ah, then, go omvard into life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who would not. willingly pay the price of a few wretched and unhappy years of misery, pain and sorrow in return for an everlasting eternity of life, health and happiness? Even the best of ns are afflicted with some kind of pain, physical defects or sorrow; for we are all imperfect, and in need of life, health, peace and. happiness forevermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So let us not be harsh with our less fortunate</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">fellow men and women, nor attempt to deprive them of a privilege that God gave to them, and.....</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">with which we have no right to interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And indeed, of what use would it be to deprive&quot;&quot; any of our fellow men and women of their Godgiven right to reproduce their own species as long as tobacco, drugs, dope, dope peddlers, M.D.’s and bootleg liquor, not to mention vacci-.......•</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">And yet, although the children of tobaccousing and dope-using parents are in many instances born with moral or mental defects, yea. sometimes with physical defects, such as deaf--- -ness, blindness, dumbness, weak heart, etc., I notice that the eugenists are not demanding tliat&quot;&quot;&quot; such persons shall Tse unsexed, at least not to the writers knowledge.

<p><span class="font5">Summing up, then: The right of all men and women to marry and have children is one oL' the birthrights of mankind, and is of divine origin. No power, then, except the power of God Almighty can lawfully take away from men and • women the right and power to reproduce. Therevw fore, men have no right or power to do this; and when they attempt to do so, they are running ahead of the Almighty God and are therefore ? committing the sin of presumption. The power of procreation was given to the human race fry Almighty God, and lie. and not man, has the right to deprive any human creature of the same.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Opposing Organizations</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">An address by Judge Rutherford, broadcast September 11 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">WATCHTOWER national chain program</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font5">N ORGANIZATION is a systematic arrangement employed and used to carry out a fixed purpose. The purpose of Jehovah is known rfoiHiin from the beginning. For God to purpose a thing means it must be done. He uses various creatures to execute His purposes. He assigns His creatures to their respective positions and permits them to carry forward His purposes according to His will. Such constitutes His organization. Jehovah is the God of order, and with Him everything is done in an orderly way. In the Scriptures the universal organization of Jehovah is named Zion. In the execution of His purposes the Logos, who is also called Jesus, is the active and executive officer of Jehovah. Man was created for the earth, and the earth for man, and perfect man was made a part of God’s organization. Lucifer, a spirit creature, was appointed by Jehovah as man’s overlord. While obedient to God Lucifer was a part of God’s organization. Everything God creates is perfect, and each creature is afforded the privilege of doing right and remaining in God’s organization or doing wrong and being cast out of His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer was perfect until he became lawless. Because of pride and ambition he was led to covet that which God had not given him. He rebelled against God and put himself in opposition to the Most High. His name was then changed to “'Satan’’, which means ffipposer to God’. He led others into wrongdoing, and this included men and angels. Then he proceeded unhindered by Jehovah to build a powerful organization in heaven and in earth, which organization is entire! v br-ar upon wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan, who is also named the Devil, not only diallengcd the word and reproached the name of Jehovah, but defied Jehovah to put on earth a man. or men that would, under all conditions, steadfastly hold their integrity with God. That raised the great issue as to who is supreme. Had God then and there prevented Satan from going ■further in his wrongful course, such would have shown the supremacy of Jehovah, but other creatures would have said that Satan did not have a fair show. Jehovah takes advantage of no one because of His supreme power. He has permitted Satan to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font5"> his length in demonstrating what wickedness he would do, and now the</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">time is at hand when the issue will be for ever settled, and settled on the side of Jehovah. The good that will result will be this: All creatures will be definitely and completely shown that Jehovah God not only is supreme in power, but is perfect in wisdom, is always fair and just, and is wholly unselfish and the Giver of every good and perfect gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two parts to Satan’s organization. One part is invisible to man, and that is composed of creatures all of whom, are wicked. The other part is visible to man and is composed of creatures who have organized to carry on earthly governments and have been overreached by Satan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible discloses that Nimrod was the first visible ruler among men and that Babel was his capital city. The name Nimrod, which God’s record gives to him, means ‘’’'rebellious one”. Without doubt Babylon was built by Nimrod under the supervision of Satan the Devil, because the Genesis record shows that it was built to make a name for others tliaii the true God. Religion was the most prominent element of the city of Babylon. The people were taught to worship Baal, which is another name for Satan the Devil. Here appears the first organized effort of Satan to turn the human race against Jehovah God. By the words of His prophet Isaiah, God not only identifies Satan as the invisible ruler of’ Babylon, but also foretells his ultimate fall. In Isaiah fourteen it is written: ‘•’Thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, . . . How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! . . . thou . . . which didst weaken the nations!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was the Devil religion that brought into existence graven images which the people were taught to worship. This was first done in Babylon, and the religionists from then till now have been deceived into having graven images to use in their worship. The prophet of Jehovah, Jeremiah, in the fiftieth chapter, writes concerning Babylon, Satan’s organization, these words: “For it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil religion, or false religion, being made the most prominent element of Babylon, every nation of earth organized from that day tn this lias had a religion Tinder the control of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Satan. He uses religion to deceive the people, and therefore the name “'Babylon, the mother of harlots”, attaches to every religion that has dishonored the word and name of Jehovah God. The people have never been able to see these matters dearly until now, because blinded by Satan. It is now God’s due time for the people to understand these truths, because the day of reckoning is at hand. God will now expose false religions that have defamed His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ancient Egypt was thereafter organized, and behind the scene the sagacious Satan manipulated the affairs. The predominant factor of Egypt was commerce and militarism. The real reason for building up a military power is to acquire and hold property whether right or wrong and to keep the people in subjection to the rulers. The political element of that nation was subservient to the commercial or military power. Religionists performed their part by instilling superstition into the minds of both the rulers and the people and mrning them to the worship of idols and away from Jehovah. The Egyptians practiced the Devil religion altogether. They had their clergy, called scribes and priests and horoscopists, who made and read signs and gave interpretation under the influence of Satan. The commercial and political elements practiced this false religion and all were against Jehovah God. In Exodus the fifth chapter the record is that the Pharaoh of Egypt said to Moses: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey his voice?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few Scriptural texts are here quoted to show that the religion of Egypt &quot;was that of the Devil. In Exodus twelve Jehovah said: “'Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment.” In Isaiah nineteen the Lord said: “The spirit of Egypt shall fail, . . . and I will destroy the counsel thereof; and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The commercial was the dominating element of ancient Egypt, while the religious element was controlled by Satan and wielded an uncanny influence over all elements of the nations and people. It was in that nation that Satan first introduced the practice of keeping the common people under restraint and control by the combined efforts of the commercial, political and religious powers. He has been doing this ever since, and in all nations has employed the military as the strong arm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then next in the order followed Assyria as an organized world power. The politicians were to the fore in that organization and they ruled by the aid and connivance of Satanic religion, and the power of commerce. The prophetic books of Jonah and Nahum are devoted to Assyria. That which God caused to be recorded concerning Assyria is chiefly prophetic and foretells of a condition that would exist on the earth in the last days of Satan’s rule and at the second coming of Christ. This prophecy discloses that at that time the political power, under the more powerful and direct control of commerce, would rule the nations of the world; and that these nations would have a religion that is hypocritical and devilish and would deceive the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Assyria had a powerful military organization, which foretells of a great military organization that would subdue the world in the last days, where we now are. The king of Assyria boasted of his political power and vhat aid he received from the Devil. Assyria as a military power was strongly fortified. While the politicians of that world power were visibly in control, the commercial factor exercised the greater power behind the scenes. Great fortunes were in the hands of the few. The religionists, under the supervision of Satan, by superstitious practice kept the common people in subjection. Concerning the commerce of Assyria the Lord, in Nahum three, says: “Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven.” Take note how the conditions then correspond with presentday conditions in the nations called “Christendom”. In these days the politicians are in the saddle, but the monetary force behind the scenes really controls; and the religionists furnish, the sanctimonious smoke screen, and by the practice of superstition keep the people in awe and in subjection to the powers that be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There have existed on earth seven universal organizations or world powers. Egypt, Assyria and Babylon, as the Bible shows, disclose the three elements that are always in control of the visible organization. Babylon is the mother, and hence the Scriptures refer to the hypocritical religions of earth as “the mother of harlots”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt the common people of all ages have desired to have an honest government. Under their leaders they have organized forms of government, but, being blind to Satan’s methods, they have fallen easy victims under his subtle and wicked influence. The purpose of Sa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tan at all times is to sustain his challenge to Jehovah that Jehovah could not put men on earth who would steadfastly hold their integrity to Him. Satan knew he could not openly accomplish his purpose with man; hence he has at all times resorted to fraud and deceit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About the third century (A. D.) the people generally began to learn of and turn to the worship of Jesus Christ, which is the origin of the Christian religion. Seeing this popularity growing, Satan saw to it that ambitious men, named “’clergymen”, were placed in control of the religious organization called “Christendom”. Doubtless many of these clergymen were honest, but many of them were ambitious and fell easy victims to Satan’s subtle influence. The so-called “'Christian religion” spread amongst the leading nations of the earth, and today these nations claim to be Christian because they claim to practice Christianity. Christendom is what is known as “organized Christianity”, and all the nations outside thereof are called heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">.....The religion of the nations called “Christendom” is claimed to be Christian. But is it? To be a Christian one must be a true follower of Christ Jesus, and must recognize, serve, worship and obey Jehovah God. He must take God’s Word as .......the truth, because the great Prophet Christ Jesus stated that God’s Word is the truth. (John 17:17) The majority of the religious leaders of ’ ■ t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so-called “Christendom” today deny the truth of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the Bible, and deny that the blood of Jesus furnishes the purchase price to redeem man from - the bondage of sin and death. The very basis of Christianity is the great ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. There is no other means of salvation, as the Word of God plainly states. (Acts 4:12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• Every modernist preacher on earth denies that God created man perfect, that he fell because of sin, and that the sacrifice of Jesus was to provide redemption for man; and yet these men claim to be Christians and are the leaders of the religion of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There cannot be two classes of leaders in God’s organization, because God is not the author of confusion. There are two, and more, classes of --“&quot;••&quot;i^-deaders in Christendom, namely, Catholic and Protestant, the Modernist and Fundamentalist, the Christian Scientists so called, and others. ‘ The Fundamentalists, without exception, teach that every man has an inherently immortal soul which therefore cannot die, and that when that which is called death ensues, the soul continues to live either in bliss or in torment. Such is based upon Satan’s lie, and Jesus declared him to be the father of lies. (Gen. 3:4; John 8:44) Every Fundamentalist leader denies that the blood of Jesus was shed that every man might have an opportunity for life, and denies that God will give every one an opportunity for such relief and restoration to life on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ, whose name Christendom adopts, restated His Father’s commandment, “Thou shalt not kill,” and specifically applied that commandment to all true Christians. He further taught that the man who hates his brother is a murderer. During the World War practically all clergymen, Modernists and Fundamentalists, taught and instilled into the people the spirit of hatred, and urged them to kill one another. There were two sides in that great war, and the clergymen of Christendom and the principal ones of their flocks were about equally divided on the respective sides; yet they all urged ■the killing of their fellow men on the opposite side. Surely this could not be the spirit of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus refused to have anything to do with the polities of the world. He was not of the world, even though He was in it. He overcame the world and told all His followers that they must overcome the world. (John 16: 33; 8: 23; 18: 3638) The reason He assigned was and is that Satan is the invisible ruler or god of the world. (John 12: 31; 14: 30) His true disciples, authorized teachers and representatives of God, told the followers of Jesus that they must keep themselves separate and distinct from the world and devote themselves to telling the truth about God’s King and His righteous kingdom.—2 Cor. 6:17,18; Jas. 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But someone will say, “'Was not the Christian church organized by Jesus and His apostles, and are not these clergymen still holding to the Christian church?’ Jesus and His apostles did organize the Christian church on earth, and for some time thereafter that organized body of men called “Christians” followed the teachings of Jesus. The church, was then pure, and the apostle refers to the same as a pure virgin espoused to Christ. (2 Cor. 11:2) Later that organization was overreached by Satan through his organization,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘But,’ another asks, ‘surely it cannot be denied that the religion of “Christendom” holds to the name of Christ and of God. and publicly calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">upon the name of God and of Christ and prays to God in public, and is not their religion therefore still the true Christian religion?’ To such the answer is that Satan’s method is always fraudulent. He induced men  in the very dawn of man’s history to hypocritically call themselves by the name of the Lord, and he has been doing that time and again since. (Gen. 4:26) The Israelites were God’s chosen and covenant people and they called themselves by the name of the Lord, and because of their unfaithfulness God said to them: “This people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart [devotion] far from me.”—Isa. 29:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As men in the days of Enos were hypocrites and called themselves by the name of God (Gen. 4:26); as the Pharisees and other religious leaders of the Jews called themselves by the name of God and were hypocritical (Matt. 23:1235); even so the religionists of Christendom are hypocritical, because they claim to be God’s people and take the name of Christ and call themselves Christians, but by their very words and course of action deny that they serve God and follow Christ. Thus the old “whore”, Babylon, has defiled and debauched that which is called “organized Christianity”. Satan accomplished this evil result by his fraud and deception, and by turning the people away from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Assyria</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ancient Assyria was a powerful political organization, with the political rulers in the van. The great power, however, was really exercised by the commercial interests. The political power or representative was in fact the spokesman for the commercial power. Great military organizations were formed and employed, to enforce the decrees of the rulers. The Devil religion furnished the camouflage for the bloody and cruel operations of that organization. This w'as done, as the prophet says, “because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.”—Nah. 3:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christendom,” so called, is modern Assyria, corresponding so exactly that it seems certain that God caused the record of ancient Assyria to be made prophetically foretelling the condition on earth at the present time. Today the politicians., of the nations of earth are in the van and are speaking great swelling words of their ability to adjust the difficulties of the world and to establish a satisfactory condition. The power behind these political rulers and spokesmen is the great commercial factors of the world. It is the latter that really provide the means for the mighty military machines to enforce the decrees of the rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the political and financial elements of ancient Assyria adopted the Devil religion of that time, even so the religious element of Christendom today ably supports the political and financial factors in world policies. Catholics and Protestants, Jewish rabbis and all other “approved” religionists, join together in extolling the virtues of the modern ruling powers, ami boast of the ability to establish peace on earth and good will toward men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ancient Assyria was a bloody organization. There is more human blood properly charged up to modern Assyria, otherwise called “Christendom”, than to any other period of the world’s history. In the World War millions of people poured out their life-blood, and many more millions have been the prey of the great military powers of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ancient Assyria was “full of lies and robbery”. (Nah. 3:1) The ten years immediately following the World War have been made prominent by the divers fraudulent and false schemes to exploit and rob the people. The farmer lias been exploited and robbed by schemes of the financiers, in which the other two ruling factors have rendered aid in wrongdoing. The burden of taxation has been greatly increased, and many persons have lost their homes and lands by reason-of exorbitant and unreasonable tax burdens placed against their property for public improvements. Public officials have become the bosses of the people instead of being servants of the people. The great financiers name the political candidates and permit the people to go through the form of voting for them, and then elect those whom the financial power desires. This is true particularly in America. The great financial institutions control the food and raiment supply that thy people must have for their maintenance and support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Material wealth was never so great as it is in modern Christendom, but this wealth is held by a few. Every nation is bristling with guns, warships, aircraft and high explosives, and other means for the destruction of human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The political rulers are making peace pacts and thereby claiming that they will outlaw war, while at the same time every nation of Christendom is making greater preparation for war than at any time past. In this policy the political element is strongly supported by the commercial and the religious element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religious element of Christendom, while claiming to follow Christ, denies His second coining and His kingdom, and refuses to hear and obey the Word of God. The clergy and religious leaders are proud, haughty, boasters, false accusers of those who serve God, and de-spisers of all who diligently seek to tell the people the truth in th© name of the Lord God. Being a factor of Satan’s organization, the religionists are supported by the other* ruling factors because the latter believe it expedient for them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul wrote a prophecy which is in this very day coming to pass, even as he said: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall he lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof ; from such turn away.”—2 Tim. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Babylon, Egypt, and Assyria emphasize, therefore, the three elements of Satan’s visible organization. Thereafter the three ruling elements were manifested in all succeeding world powers. Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome followed in the order named. Each of those world powers practiced the Devil religion. The religion of .ancient Rome was called pagan. In the course of time the stronger political rulers of Rome adopted the &quot;‘’Christian religion” and carried into that organization, so formed, many of the ceremonies practiced by the pagans. Rome became a great military power, and her commercial and political and religious interests walked hand in hand in oppressing the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then came the British Empire as a mighty world power, and in this the three elements, commercial, political and religious, formed the ruling factors and continue to rule. It too has become a tremendous commercial power and a great and cruel military power, and the religionists form a part of the government. Surely it could not be said that any one of these world powers is any part of God’s organization. Since there are but two great organizations, this empire must of necessity be of Satan’s organization. Exactly the same is true concerning America, where the three elements of Satan’s organization rule the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The World War produced a condition making possible the formation of the eighth world power, to wit, the League of Nations, and that was foretold in prophecy. (Isa. 8:9, 10; Rev. 17:9, 11) That alliance or pact was formed by the political element, aided and supported by the financial and military factors, and fully supported and approved by the religionists of Christendom. The latter openly declared in 1919 that ’'the League of Nations constitutes God’s kingdom on earth’ and substitutes therefor. Can it be honestly contended that the League of Nations constitutes any part of God’s organization? If not, then certainly it is of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Moral Conditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the World War the moral conditions of the earth were bad enough, but all will agree that since the World 'War the moral degeneracy is far worse. There is great corruption in public official places. The exploiting of the people is boldly carried on; the public press is full of accounts of crime and scandal. Even the vice among young students has become such that it is appalling and causing great concern to parents. Many honest persons join in the effort to prohibit the manufacture and use of intoxicating liquors, believing that in so doing they will aid the moral status of the people. The facts show that the Devil has seized upon this condition to ' increase immorality and debauchery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the World War it was thought to be wrong for men  to indulge in the use of tobacco and liquor. Since the war women use both tobacco and liquor, even more freely than men, and this is extended even to young girls and boys in the public schools. Because of these alarming conditions many good people are now seeking earnestly to find the remedy. There must be a reason for this terrible condition. There is a reason, and there is a remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">More than 4,000 years ago Jehovah God gave promise that He would produce a seed from His universal organization by and through which He would clear out all wickedness from the universe and establish peace and righteousness and bring the blessings of liberty and life to all the nations of the earth. Jehovah's provision, therefore, is the complete remedy for the ills of humankind, and His time is at hand to put that remedy into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many centuries faithful and honest men have prayed and hoped for the coming of this great and righteous ruler which is called the promised “Seed”. Following the lead of Jesus and His apostles these faithful ones have worshiped and served Jehovah God. Relying upon the promises of God that He would cause His organization of righteousness to take charge of the affairs of men on earth, as well as the affairs of heaven, the faithful folloAvers of Christ have fought on earnestly under the banner of the Lord. These have constituted the visible part of God’s organization. Satan and his organization have opposed them at every turn of the road. The faithful followers of Christ have suffered reproach and persecution, and under the great strain many have fallen away to Satan, but the faithful and true ones continue to fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now the Day Star has arisen. The faithful servants of the Lord now see the prophecies of God unfolding and they see that the day of deliverance of suffering humanity is at hand; that God through His great organization is fulfilling His promise made long ago and they hear His commandments saying to them: ‘Ye are my witnesses that I am God; go and tell the people this good news. The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They are thrilled with joy, and hasten to obey the commandments of the Lord. Men and women hurry to your homes to bring to you the good news of the day of deliverance through God’s great organization. Whom would you expect to oppose the work of these men and women? Satan, of course, because he has always opposed God, and these faithful witnesses of God arcnow the only ones on earth who are boldly announcing the destruction of Satan’s organization. The clergy oppose the proclamation of the truth and persecute these humble men and women who are acting as God’s witnesses. You must therefore decide to which organization the clergy belong and whom they represent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus plainly told the same class of men: ‘You are of your father the Devil, and his bidding you do.’ The clergy cause these faithful witnesses of the Lord to be arrested and thrown into prison on the pretext of violating what they call ‘the Sunday lawk But counting not their lives dear unto them these faithful men and women go on to bring to the people the truth in obedience to the Lord’s commandment. They are your friends. The clergy are against your interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful disciples of Jesus looked for the coming of this day. To Jesus they propounded the question: ‘Master, what shall be the sign of your coming and of the day of deliverance?’ Ever since that day, 1900 years ago, the faithful Christians have been inquiring in the same manner and looking for the same signs. The book of Revelation speaks of two great signs appearing in heaven for the benefit of these faithful watchers to enable them to mark the setting up of the kingdom. Until now’ the bock of Revelation has been a sealed book. It is now open and these two great signs may now be understood by all who love God and righteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">heroism on soil that is richer for the blood they gave it.” How simple! Just a matter of fertilizing the soil with the proper material, which the general says is blood, and not just blood, but human blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But Why enrich European soil Avhen our farmers need relief so badly. Doesn’t charity begin at home? “It does,” says Al Capone and his blood-spilling soil enrichers; and so having caught something of the same vision which the general has seen, they proceed to make fertile the soil of our fair land. The police, politicians and big business men, being on the side of the farmer, naturally see that no one interferes with his agricultural pursuits. In a few years the land, especially around Chicago, should grow crops such as Luther Burbank never dreamed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But what I can’t see is how the preachers missed such a good one for their sermons to get the boys to enlist. They only promised that they would go to heaven for dying on the battlefield, and never so much as mentioned the good they would do the farmer by “enriching the sod”. This would have comforted mourning parents and bereaved widows considerably. But I must not be too hard on the preachers, because they were under contract and probably their contract did not call for this extra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be nice if the doctors could be induced to see the merit of this method, because they might return to the good old days of bloodletting and thereby enrich the soil considerably without going to all the bother of having a war. I don’t want to be too hard on the doctors either, because they are doing pretty well along that line as it is. Of course some sort of research work would have to be done first to find out just what effect modern blood, filled with vaccines and serums, would have on the growth of parsnips, turnips, pumpkins, onions, cabbages, etc. They might not stand it as well as the good-natured, gullible general public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But anyway, Gen. Pershing should be decorated with some sort of medal and should receive some honorary title from the agricultural schools of the land, such as B. S. (Bachelor of Science) or B. A. (Bachelor of Arts, Agriculture or Army), or other. One thing, though, I hope the parents of boy scouts who are not in sympathy with farm relief will not read Gen. Pershing’s address. They might not appreciate the end results of the military training their boys receive. The term “cannon, fodder” should now be dropped; “soil enricher” is more expressive of the benefits of war, and it sounds much nicer, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I think I ought to close now. There’s lots more could be said. I have merely called your attention to -what our boys did for the farmer. I am persuaded the preachers will not miss their chance again, but in the next war, which everyone is preparing for, they will “say it with flowers” and flowery words. But let us all cooperate in bringing the next war to our land. Our soil needs it, for there hasn’t been a real good “enriching of the soil” since the days of the Civil War.</span></p>
